Halperin DASDPolicy Planning and Arms ControlISA SUBJECT Final Report OSD Vietnam Task Force On June 17 19&7 Secretary Robert S. McNamara directed that a Task Force be formed to study the history of United States involvement in Vietnam from world war II to the present. Mr. McNamaras guidance was simply to do studies that were "encyclopedic and objective." with six full-time professionals assigned to the Task Force we were to complete our work in three months. A year and a half later and with the involvement of six times six professionals we are finally done to the tune of thirty-seven studies and fifteen collections of documents contained in forty-three volumes. In the beginning Mr. McNamara gave the Task Force full access to OSD files and the Task Force received access to CIA materials and some use of State Department cables and memoranda we had no access to white House files. Our guidance prohibited personal interviews with any of the principal participants. -The result was not so much a documentary history as a history based solely on documents checked and rechecked with ant-like diligence. Pieces of paper formidable and suggestive by themselves could have meant much or nothing. Perhaps this document was never sent anywhere and perhaps that one though commented upon was irrelevant without the memories of people to tell us we were certain to make mistakes. Yet using those memories might have been misleading as well. This approach to research was bound to lead to distortions and distortions we are sure abound in these studies. To bring the documents to life to fill in gaps and just to see what the "outside world" was thinking we turned to newspapers periodicals and books we never used these sources to supplant the classified documents but only to supplement them. And because these documents sometimes written by very clever men who knew so much and desired to say only a part and sometimes written very openly but also contradictorily are not immediately self-revealing or self-explanatory we tried both to have a number of researchers look at them and to quote passages liberally. Moreover when we felt we could be challenged with taking something out of context we included the whole paper in the Documentary Record section of the Task Force studies (Parts V and VI. A and B).Again seeking to fend off inevitable mistakes in interpretation and context what seemed to us key documents were reviewed and included in several overlapping in substance but separate studies. UNCLASSIFIED WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURE  The people who worked on the Task Force were superbuniformly bright and interested although not always versed in the art of research. Ue had a sense of doing something important and of the need to do it right. Of course we all had our prejudices and axes to grind and these shine through clearly at times but we tried we think to suppress or compensate for them. These outstanding people came from everywhere--the military services State OSD and the "think tanks." Some came for a month for three months for six months and most were unable given the unhappiness of their superiors to finish the studies they began. Almost all the studies had several authors each heir dutifully trying to pick up the threads of his predecessor. In all we had thirty-six professionals working on these studies with an average of four months per man. The quality style and interest of the studies varies considerably. The papers in Parts I II III and IV.A concerning the years 1945 to 1961 tend to be generally non-startling--although there are many interesting tidbits. Because many of the documents in this period were lost or not kept (except for the Geneva Conference era) we had to rely more on outside resources. From 1961 onwards (Parts IV.B and C and VI.C) the records were bountiful especially on the first Kennedy year in office the Diem coup and on the subjects of the deployment of ground forces the decisions surrounding the bombing campaign against North Vietnam US-GVN relations and attempts at negotiating a settlement of the conflict. Almost all the studies contain both a Summary and Analysis and a Chronology. The chronologies highlight each important event or action in the monograph by means of date description and documentary source. The Summary and Analysis sections which I wrote attempt to capture the main themes and facts of the monographsand to make some judgments and speculations which may or may not appear in the text itself. The monographs themselves stick by and large to the documents and do not tend to be analytical. writing history especially where it blends into current events especially where that current event is Vietnam is a treacherous exercise. Ue could not go into the minds of the decision-makers we were not present at the decisions and we often could not tell whether something happened because someone decided it decided against it or most likely because it unfolded from the situation. History to me has been expressed by a passage from Herman Melville's Moby Dick where he writes "This is a world of chancefree will and necessity all interweavingly working together as one; chance by turn rules either and has the last featuring blow at events." Our studies have tried to reflect this thought; inevitably in the organizing and writing process they appear to assign more and less to men and free will than was the case.
