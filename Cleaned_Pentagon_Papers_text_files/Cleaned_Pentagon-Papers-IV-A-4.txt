SUMMARY "Hanoi was evacuated on 9 October 19547 The U.S. liason team left with the last French troops, disturbed by what they had seen of the grim efficiency of the Viet Minh in their takeover, the contrast between the silent march of the victorious Viet Minh troops in their tennis shoes and the clanking armor of the well-equipped French whose western tactics and equipment had failed against the communist military-political-economic campaign." 1 Up to 1960, Vietnam was one of the largest recipients of U.S. economic and military assistance in the world the third ranking non-NATO recipient of aid, the seventh ranking worldwide. The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam (MAAG), was the only military mission commanded by a lieutenant general; the U.S. economic aid mission in Vietnam was the largest anywhere. In the years 1955 through 1960, more than $2 billion in aid flowed into Vietnam, and '. more than 805, of that assistance went toward providing security for the Government of Vietnam. Nonetheless, in 1960 the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that the armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam (RVNAF) were inadequately trained and organized, and directed urgent action by MAAG to improve their anti-guerrilla capabilities. 2 Thus, despite the massive U.S. investment in aid to Vietnam in the period 1954-1960, very little had been accomplished in the way of fashioning South Vietnamese forces into a suitable instrument for countering the "communist military-political-economic campaign" aimed at overturning the Government of Vietnam. The principal issue examined here is that of the role and effectiveness of U.S. advice and assistance provided the armed forces of the GVN prior to 1960. The principal focus is on American assistance to the Vietnamese National Army subsequently the ARVN although plans and support for the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps are also considered. Subsidiary questions include Why did the U.S. undertake the training of ARVN? How was this decision taken? . A -- what was the threat to South Vietnam? what was the mission of the South Vietnamese army? what was the state of the South Vietnamese army? -- How did the U.S. go about altering this condition? Did U.S. assistance through 1960 result in creation of South Vietnamese army in the image of the U.S. army? The principal conclusion is that U.S. efforts in the period 1954-1959 failed to produce an effective Vietnamese counterinsurgent force due to contemporary perceptions of and reactions to the threat, to exaggerated estimates of the value and relevance of American military standards in responding to that threat, to lack of effective bargaining techniqucs vis-a-vis the Government of Vietnam, and to fragmentation and other inadequacies in the American system of determining and administering the overall program of assistance to Vietnam.- U.S. efforts in the period 1954-1960 to create an effective South Vietnamese military establishment and particul.ar.ly an effective National Array were critically affected by the following considerations; The reasons the U.S. undertook the training of the Vietnamese armed forces had their roots not only in the desire to contain communism and preserve the freedom of South Vietnam, but also in U.S. discontent and frustration with French military policy during the Indochina war. A strong desire to correct French mistakes generated con-siderable bureaucratic 'momentum; preoccupation with the perceived inadequacies of French practices led to under-estimation of the problems the French had to overcome including that of internal division and governmental reluctance in developing an effective Vietnamese army, and to overeorrection of French mistakes by the creation of a conventional military force. That Vietnamese army came to be organized in divisions as the U.S. had so often and so unsuccessfully urged the French to do that would have the capability to perform well against the Viet Minh divisions in the Red River Delta in 1954, or presumably against their post-1954 equivalent, coKtouhist divisions crossing the 17th parallel. But the French Indochina War was over; circumstances had radically changed. -- The decision to train the South Vietnamese military was based on a compromise between the Departments of State and Defense in which "political considerations" which had nothing to do with the military objections to an affirmative decision, 2.1 TOP SECRFT  and did not in any way affect the probability of success of the undertaking, were allowed to govern rather than considerations of limitations in U.S. resources and capabilities, and the basic difficulty of the task at hand. Increasingly a characteristic of U.S. decision making, such compromise maximized the probability of consistently selecting the least desirable course of action. The threat to Vietnam was perceived as constituted of the sects and the Viet Minh residue in the South, and the regular forces of the DRV in the North; although it was consistently estimated that the DRV had the capability to overrun South Vietnam, it was just as consistently estimated that the DRV neither needed nor intended to do so. Nonetheless, U.S. doctrine regarding estimates of capability as opposed to estimates of intention with its'characteristic emphasis on Order of Battle data (so small a part of the real intelligence problem in counterinsurgency) led to fixation upon the more massive, but less likely, threat of overt invasion.. The dual mission expected of the Vietnamese army of internal and external defense was, given resource and trained manpower limitations, internally inconsistent. Given the state of U.S. strategic thinking in the 1950's, the nature of SRATO, the withdrawal of the FEC, the pressures exerted by Diem, and .the background of the U.S. MAAG, rooted in the recent Korean experience, it was virtually certain to lead to a conventional military establishment designed to counter a conventional threat. It did. In fact, given the strength of these influences and the lack of U.S. familiarity with effective counterinsurgenttechniques, it is questionable whether assignment of a single mission related exclusively to internal security would have made any difference in the type of military establishment that resulted. The South Vietnamese army was in extremely poor condition in 1954; its prospects were worse, in view of the limited resources, particularly in terms of personnel, the U.S. was able to devote t? its reorganization and .training. In addition, as the JCS stated, "Unless the Vietnamese themselves show an inclination to make individual and collective sacrifices required to resist Communism, which they have not done to date, no amount of external pressure and assistance can long delay complete Communist victory in South Vietnam." There was no overwhelming change in the willingness to sacrifice during the late 1950's, which added to the already formidable task of creating an effective military establishment.-- The way in which the U.S. MAAG went about creating an effective military establishment had four principal characteristics Memorandum for Secbef from JCS, "Indochina," 17 November 1954 (TS). j3.1concentration on the mission of resistance to overt aggression; training from the top down; employment of U.S. standards and techniques; and optimistic assessment of the future capabilities of paramilitary organizations outside the purview of MAAG. The result of U.S. efforts was more a reflection of the U.S. military establishment than of the type of threat or terrain, with regard to the overall effectiveness of U.S. aid, it seems to have had, unfortunately, all the depth the term "mirror image" implies. Furthermore, U.S. performance in creating an effective Vietnamese military establishment was adversely affected by the lack of well-founded bargaining techniques vis-a-vis the Government of Vietnam, and by fragmentation and other inadequacies in the American system of determining and administering the overall program of assistance. The U.S. quickly became so deeply and so overtly com-mi tted to the Diem government that any leverage inherent in the assistance program rapidly approached zero. Perhaps the best illustration of the lack of leverage concerning the defense establishment is the case of the Civil Guard, in which the principal effects of the U.S. bargaining were negative and most directly affected the very organization the U.S. was trying to improve. The case of the Civil Guard, a primary internal security force, also affords excellent examples of two sorts of fragmentation affecting the U.S. effort U.S, interagency competition (the CG was ultimately transferred to the MOD on the advice of MAAG, but against not only the prior advice of the MSU advisory team but also against the wishes of the Dnbassy); and lack of coordination at Embassy level by which the entire military assistance effort could be evaluated and resources more rationally allocated (the Civil Guard was evaluated completely differently by MAAG and by the Enbassy). A third variety of fragmentation is revealed in the relations between Washington and its various representatives in the field. Both the GVN and the several U.S. agencies relied heavily on washington for arbitration of disputes Fragmentation in the U.S. community had an obvious and adverse effect on the U,S. capability to bargain with the GVN. By devoting minimal care to the selection of the U.S. official he would talk to first, Diem could often become the arbiter of, rather than a participant in, the bargaining process. Thus General Williams "I cant remember one time that President Diem ever did anything of importance concerning the military that I recommended against." "Why U.S. Is Losing in Vietnam," U.S. Rews and World Report, November 9, 1964. 4.1generated in Saigon, Diem carrying his position to the highest levels of the agency of- his choice, while U.S. representatives had to seek protagonists at various levels within their own .. agencies. The implications for U.S. policy in the field are obvious. Because of the divisions and diversions inherent in the above, U.S. aid in the period up to 1960 failed to produce an effective counterinsurgent force either within the National Army, or in the paramilitary organizations. This is not to imply that had resources been diverted from the creation of a conventional army to that of an effective counterinsurgent force the problem of Vietnam would have been solved, for the enemy has demonstrated both versatility and flexibility that would render such a statement vacuous. It is to suggest, however, that given the world situation in the period of relevance and the situation in Southeast Asia, it seems likely that the DRV, whatever strategic alternative it might have elected to follow, would not have been deterred from overt aggression by any army of Vietnam it waswithin U.S.-GVN capability to create. An effective counterinsurgent force, on the other hand, might have limited its. choices; might well have prevented effective prosecution of the guerrilla alternative the Viet Cong and the DRV did elect to follow.'----7 5.1 ,V PRINCIPA.L PERsorulJTIES, 1954-1960 UNITED sTATES OFFICE TERM OF OFFICS President 20 Jan 195320 Jan 1961 secretary of State 21 Jan 195315 Apr 1959 H16 Apr 195920 Jan 196!

THE FRENCH DELEGATES (GUY LACHAMBRE, EDGAR FAURE, GENERAL ELY, AND AMBASSADOR HENRI BONNET) AGREED IN PRINCIPLE THAT THE STEPS TO ACHIEVE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE 1) THE CANCELLATION OF THE PAU AGREEMENTS WHICH GAVE FRANCE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY, COMMERCE AND FINANCES OF VIETNAM, 2) THE TRANSFER OF THE OVERALL COMMAND OF THE NATIONAL ARMY TO THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT, 3) TO PUT THE U.S. MILITARY MISSION IN CHARGE OF TRAINING THE VIETNAMESE ARMY, 4) TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM FULL CONTROL OVER ALL AID FUNDS FROM THE U.S., FINALLY 5) TO WITHDRAW THE EXPEDITIONARY CORPS UPON REQUEST OF THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT.

FRENCH POLICY, WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSITE. PARIS HAD SECRETLY CONCLUDED AND AGREEMENT WITH HOS GOVT. GRANTING THE EQUIVALENT OF RECOGNITION. JEAN SAINTENY, IN HANOI, WAS WORKING FOR GOOD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST REGIME, WHICH WOULD SEND A PERMANENT DELEGATION TO PARIS. THE FRENCH WISHED TO KEEP A BIG FOOT IN THE DOOR WHICH WE SOUGHT TO SLAM. THEY BELIEVED THAT THE SOUTH WOULD BE TAKEN OVER BY THE COMMUNISTS IN 1956 BUT THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE CHINESE COULD NOT SUPPLY MUCH ECONOMIC AID AND A GOOD MARKET FOR FRANCE COULD BE PRESERVED.

SMM REPT. 101154 IN MEMO TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WILSON, DULLES EXPRESSED IDEA THAT SECRETARY SHOULD CUT DOWN ON THE SIZE OF FORCES REQUIRED IN THE COUNTRIES OF S.E.ASIA SINCE NONE NEED ACT ALONE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THE FRENCH REQUEST FOR FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE FEC PLUS A 150,000 MAN ARMY WAS UNFEASIBLE FOR U.S. AT THAT TIME.

IT SPOKE OUT SHARPLY AGAINST PLANS TO REPLACE DIEM. IF DIEM WAS OVERTHROWN THEN THE U.S. SHOULD CONSIDER AN IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF ALL AID TO VIETNAM AND THE FRENCH UNION FORCES THERE, EXCEPT THAT OF A HUMANITARIAN NATURE. MANSFIELD DEFENDED DIEM ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE HAD A REFUTATION THROUGHOUT VIETNAM'FOR INTENSE NATIONALISM AND EQUALLY INTENSE INCORRUPTIBILITY. HE DENOUNCED THE INCREDIBLE CAMPAIGN OF SUBVERSION BY INTRIGUE AND THE CONSPIRACY OF NON-COOPERATION AND SABOTAGE THAT HAD STOOD IN THE WAY OF DIEM'S FORGING AHEAD WITH HIS PROPOSED CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM. U.S. 101554 THE VIETNAMESE ARMY WAS INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING MINOR POLICE ACTIONS WITHOUT FRENCH STAFF AND LOGISTICS. JCS HIST. 101854 JCS VIEWED THE POLITICAL NECESSITY OF TRAINING THE VIETNAMESE ARMY WAS WORTH THE RISK. JCS HIST. 101954 IN MEMO TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, JCS ELABORATED ON THE JUSTIFICATION FOR INCREASED VIETNAMESE ARMY. SEATO DID NOT PROVIDE FOR MILITARY COMMITMENTS BY MEMBER COUNTRIES. THE REQUESTED WITHDRAWAL OF FEC WOULD CREATE A SERIOUS VACUUM TO COPE WITH RESIDUAL VIETMINH AGGRESSION. VIETNAM OBJECTIVE WAS THE LIMITED DEFENSE OF THE 17TH PARALLEL TO DETER AGGRESSION AND THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNAL SECURITY. JCS DID NOT WANT TO TRAIN SOUTH VIETNAMESE WITH ONLY A 342-MAN MAAG. BUT IF TRAINING WAS NECESSARY, THEY FELT THAT FRANCE "HANDS OFF" WAS ESSENTIAL. JCS HIST. 102254 NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE OPERATIONS CO-ORDINATING BOARD CALLING FOR A LIMITED AND INTERIM TRAINING PROGRAM. A MESSAGE TO AMBASSADOR HEATH IN SAIGON AND GENERAL O'DANIEL INSTRUCTED THEM TO COLLABORATE IN ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE LOYALTY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VNA.

JCS HIST. 111754 IN A MEMO TO THE PRESIDENT, DULLES REITERATED GENERAL COLLINS' VIEW THAT IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR FEC TO WITHDRAW. WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE UP TO $100 MILLION.

THIS MISSION WAS TO BE INCREASED TO 6,000 BY THE END OF 19 VIETNAMESE ARMY STRENGTH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 170,000 REGULARS AND 10,000 AUXILIARIES.

IT WOULD CAUSE SERIOUS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY REPERCUSSIONS. JCS HIST. 121254 DIEM NAMED GENERAL LE VAN TY TO BE THE NEW CHIEF OF STAFF REPLACING GENERAL HINH. THE APPOINTMENT APPEARED BASED MORE OR EE'S LOYALTY TO DIEM THAN ON ABILITY.

U.S, TRAINING OP THE VIETiiAlESE NATIONAL ARMY, 1954-1959 A. Why did the U.S, undertake the training of ARVN? I Underlying the U.S. decision to train the ARVN were broad political objectives and beliefs relating to Asia, together with narrower considerations relating to methods of achieving U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia. Both broad and narrow considerations had their origins in the post-World War II chaos in Asia; both stemmed from the overall U.S. aim to deter or defeat communist aggression wherever and whenever it might occur; and both became pillars of U.S. Indochina policy with the fall of Mainland China to the communists in 1949. On the broader level, the U.S. decision to train the Vietnamese armed forces was viewed as necessary to preserve the independence and freedom of Vietnam south of the 17th parallel, an essential prerequisite to the containment of communism. Containmentlately a function of SEATO as well as of the U.S.was viewed as essential to the preservation of the rest of Southeast Asia from communist domination and control. Communist domination of the area was viewed as the outcome associated with the fall of Free Vietnam by the proponents of the domino theory, which continued as a major influence on U.S. foreign policy throughout the period examined here. "In view of the importance of Vietnam to all of Southeast Asia, I am convinced that the United States should expend the funds, materiel, and effort required to strengthen the country and help it retain its independence," reported General J. Lawton Collins. "If the chances of success are difficult to calculate, the results of a withdrawal of American aid are all too certain, not only in Vietnam, but throughout Southeast Asia. Such a withdrawal would hasten the rate of communist advances in the Far East as a whole and could result in the loss of Southeast Asia to communism. In my opinion, the chance of success is not only worth the gamble; we cannot afford to let free Vietnam go by default." 3 On the narrower level, several considerations tended to urge an affirmative decision concerning a training role for the U.S. 1. Throughout the French-Indochina war, U.S. authorities continually urged the French to create and trar'n a Vietnamese National Army. This measure was pressed not only because the U.S. believed it to be a necessary political gesture (evidence of the true independence of the Associated Statcs), but also because U.S. experts viewed it as a military measure vital to the successful prosecution of the war. 4 ,2. The U.S. was never satisfied with French efforts concerning the Vietnamese National Army and was continually frustrated by apparent French reluctance to act on this score. Particularly disturbing to U.S. officials were French inaction concerning formation of the VNA into divisional units, French training procedures, and French reluctance to develop a Vietnamese officer corps in short, acute frustration was caused by French refusal to initiate changes U.S. officials believed, rightly or wrongly, that the U.S.,could and would initiate if the U.S. were in charge. 3- The U.S. had the capability to train "native armies," as demonstrated by Korean forces. Although U.S. pressure on the French culminated in a French visit to Korea to observe U.S. training methods and procedures, the French were most impressed with the unsuitability of Korean forces and the methods used to train them to the situation in Indochina. 5 4. The U.S. had been considering the idea of U.S. training of Vietnamese forces since early in the Indochina war; in fact, the U.S. had been asked as early as 1950 to participate in a Vietnamese plan for a Vietnamese National Army trained and equipped by the U.S. without French participation. 6 The U.S. attitude was ambivalent. As early as April 1952 the Service Secretaries suggested that the U.S. expand the Indochina MAAG to undertake training and equipping of a national army should the French declare their intention to withdraw from Indochina; 7 in January 1954 General Erskine suggested elevating MAAG to the status of a mission "to help in training." 8 On the other hand, although the theme of U.S. training of Vietnamese forces became increasingly prominent from early 1953 on, a high-level committee in Defense recommended against seeking direct American participation in training in January of that year, and the JCS agreed with this recommendation, which stemmed from French opposition to any such role for the U.S., relatively higher French qualifications to train the local armies, and from the language problem. 0 As the war neared its close, however, CHMAAG General O'Daniel, in face of firm and consistent opposition from the French, pressed harder and harder for a direct American involvement in the training of Vietnamese forces; in May 1954 General Ely, the French High Commander, apparently succumbed to O'Daniel's pressure to agree to U.S. training of, and the positioning of U.S. advisors with, Vietnamese units. 10 On 9 June 1954, Ely, through O'Daniel, requested the U.S. to organize and supervise the training of Vietnamese divisions, and to do the same for all other Vietnamese training. 11 By this time, hovzever, U.S. decisionmakers believed that the "situation in Vietnam has degenerated to point where any commitments at this time to send over U.S. instructors in near future might expose us to being faced with situation in which it would be contrary to our interests to have to fulfill such commitments," 12 and they feared that, "It may be that in effort to draw U.S. into conflict without having U.S. conditions on intervention met, French military may now seek U.S, training 2 Sensiti,62 in advance of U.S. commitment to intervene with own combat forces we are resolved not to get drawn in to training program to reverse situation training program has virtually no chance of success" 13 Although O'Daniel repeatedly requested a reversal of this decision, going as far as to request his plea by passed on "to the highest authority" on 26 June, 14 the denial stood to the end of the Indochina war. 5. This prolonged involvement with the problem of affording U.S. assistance in training of the Vietnamese National Army lost hardly any of the momentum given it by General ODaniel during the final days of the lndochina war in spite of the U.S. decision to stop all aid shipments to Indochina on 30 July 1954 and to reconsider the entire problem of U.S. actions relating to Indochina. 15 On 27 July, General O'Daniel again urged that the U.S,, without French interference, undertake a priority program for training the Vietnamese Army, and took steps to expand the attthorized roster of MAAG personnel prior to the Geneva-imposed strength ceiling deadline of 1.1 August without Washington approval of the program. 16 It is believed that this momentum, generated in Saigon and supported by the Department of State, was of itself of considerable importance in the actual taking of the decision to organize and train Vietnamese forces. B. How was the decision to organize and train Vietnamese forces taken? Ambassador Heath and his superiors in the Department of State "strongly concurred" with General 0Daniels recommendation of 27 July that the U.S. undertake a priority program to train the Vietnamese Army. 17 The JCS, however, recommended that "before the United States assumes responsibility for training the forces of any of the Associated States certain preconditions were four in number "a reasonably strong, stable civil government in control"; a request from each of the Associated States that the U.S. "assume responsibility for training their forces and providing the military equipment, financial assistance, and political advice necessary to insure internal stability"; arrangements with the French "granting full independence to the Associated States and providing for the phased orderly withdrawal of French forces, French officials, and French advisors from Indochina"; and "the size and composition of the forces... should be dictated by the local military requirements and the over-all U.S. interests." 18 These recommendations were transmitted by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of State by letter. 19 In response to this letter, Secretary Dalles indicated that Cambodia had already met the recommended conditions, and that although Vietnam had not yet done so, the U.S. should nonetheless undertake a training program since strengthening the army was in fact prerequisite to stability ("one of the most efficient means of enabling the Viet- namesc Government to become strong is to assist it in reorganizing the National Army and in training that Army.") 20 Alt; ugh in approvingNSC 54292, which provided for the maintenance of forces in Indochina as necessary to assure the internal security of the area, the NSC had apparently decided the issue in favor of the Secretary of State, the disagreement between State and Defense continued with an additional dispute concerning the level of forccs to be maintained. In agreeing to train Cambodian forces, the JCS in effect reasserted their earlier position vis-a-vis Vietnam t However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note with concern the unstable political situation presently existing within the state of South Vietnam, and accordingly consider that this is not a propitious time to further indicate United States intentions with respect to the support and training of either the Vietnamese regular or police forces. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend against the assignment of a training mission to MAAG Saigon. 21 In recommending force levels for Vietnam, the JCS reiterated the above recommendation and pointed out that the US MAAG would be limited by the Geneva cease-fire agreement, that "the development of the proposed forces...will require extensive and detailed training which will extend over a period of 3 to 5 years," and that "in view of the uncertain capabilities of the French and Vietnamese to retrieve, retain, and reorganize the dispersed forces of Vietnam, it may be several years before an effective military force will exist. Therefore, U.S. military support to that area, including the training and equipping of forces, should be accomplished at low priority and not at the expense of other U.S. military programs and should not be permitted to impair the development through MDA programs of effective and reliable forces elsewhere." 22 The JCS proposed Vietnamese forces of 184,000 (5 divisions of light infantry including one light artillery battalion per division-41,000; 12 regiments--24,0O0; gendarmerie--9,000; Headquarters, Service and Support forces110,000), a militia of 50,000, and a small air force and navy, and proposed that "French forces consisting of a minimum of 4 divisions...should be retained in this country until phased out by U.S.-trained Viet Nam units." 23 The Secretary of State, still believing in the need for a U.S. training mission, disagreed with the force levels proposed by the JCS, considering them excessive to the requirement of maintaining internal security as expressed in NSC 54292. 24 On 19 October the JCS argued that their force proposals were justified by the ultimate objectives of the forces of Vietnam and repeated their opposition, from a military point of view, to U.S. participation in the training of Vietnamese forces. Their memorandum concluded, however, by providing the concession the Department of State must have so eagerly sought ,aensnlve However, if it is considered that political considerations are overriding, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would agree to the assignment of a training mission to MAAG, Saigon, with safeguards against French interference with the U.S. training mission. 25 With this crack in the Defense position, the OCR recommended, and the NSC approved a limited and interim training program for Vietnam. On 22 October a Joint State-Defense message was dispatched to Saigon authorizing Ambassador Heath and General O'Daniel to "collaborate in setting in motion a crash program designed to bring about an improvement in the loyalty and the effectiveness of the Free Vietnamese forces," 26 and on 26 October the Secretary of Defense, in accordance with the request of the President, instructed the JCS to prepare a "long-range program for the reorganization and training of the minimum number of Free Vietnamese forces necessary for internal security (paragraph lOdl of NSC 54292)." 27 The decision, subject only to refinement, negotiation with the French, and reexamination in the light of redevelopments, had been taken---and had been taken largely on tire basis of an opening inthe position of the Department of Defense which, far from dealing with the specific and reasonable objections to U.S. training of Vietnamese forces, simply avoided those objections by making the concession on totally different grounds. 28 The impact of the President's decision not to assist the French by bombing at Dien Bien Phu and of his refusal to permit the landing of a U.S. force in the Hanoi-Haiphong area after the fall of Dien Bien Pnu as recommended by the Chairman of the JCS also seems to have contributed to this concession. As reported by James Gavin, "...there was a compromise. We would not attack North Vietnam, but we would support a South Vietnamese government that w4 would provide a stable, independent government that was representative of the people. As I said before, we saw ourselves as the good guys. The French had let us down, but we would continue the battle. Also, we in the Army were so relieved that we had blocked the decision to commit ground troops to Vietnam that we were in no mood to quibble over the compromise." 29 The refinement of the decision to organize and train the national army, dealing with missions and force levels, was complctcd by the JCS on 17 November 1954; in an interesting change of position (see note 28), the Joint Chiefs asserted that "MAAG Indochina is capable of furnishing training assistance to develop the internal security Army and Navy forces, provided a. A maximum portion of the MAAG military personncl is devoted to training; and b. Tile cooperation and collaboration of the French MAAG is secured." 30 Negotiations with the French were completed when the agreed minute of understanding between General J. Lawton Collins and General ,' Paul Ely of 13 December 1954 was approved by the U.S. and, later, by the French governments. The agreement, which provided for full autonomy for Vietnamese forces by 1 July 1955 and for assumption by the US MAAG of full responsibility for assisting the Government of Vietnam in the organizing and training of armed forces (under the general supervision of the French High Commander and with the help of French advisors), led to the assumption of this responsibility by General O'Daniel on 12 Febru-ary 1955- The reexamination of the decision, reported by the JCS on 21 Janu-ary 1955, suggested that "although national policy prescribes making every possible effort to prevent South Vietnam from falling to the communists, the degree to which the United States is willing to support this policy in men, money, materials, and acceptance of additional war risks is not readily apparent," and urged that "Prior to consideration of military courses of action with respect to this area, a firm decision at national level as to implementation of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia is mandatory." Although no such decision was forthcoming, and even this reexamination of the decision to assist the Vietnamese did not choose one course of action over any other, it did imply by repeated honks on the domino klaxon that U.S. assistance to Vietnam was required. When, a week later, General Collins expressed in more positive terms this need, the way was clear for the NSC to endorse a strong U.S. policy in Vietnam, 31 confirming General O'Daniel's takeover on February 12--but the extent to which the U.S. was preparod to support this policy' (then or now) was never made clear. C what vzas the threat to South Vietnam? In addition to the more general considerations underlying the U.S. decision to train Vietnamese forces was the specific consideration of the enemy threat to South Vietnam. As perceived during the time this decision was being taken, the threat consisted of three elements the dissident sect forces in South Vietnam; the communist forces in South-Vietnam, dominated by the decisionmakers in Hanoi; and the Vietnamese People's Army of North Vietnam. ( 1. The sect forces, consisting of an estimated 10,000 Cao Dai, 2,500 Hoa Hao, and 2,600 Bien Xuyen forces, plus the urban police forces which were at that time under the control of the Binh Xuyen, were in opposition to the fledgling Diem government, 32 "The politico-religious armed groups called the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen are anti-communist in orientation, but feudalistic and regressive in all other respects. At present they- have an effective veto power ever government action. This power they use to block reforms which might threaten their preferred military, economic, and political status. They will ,0 Sensitivc retain their power to threaten and harass the government until the National Array is strong enough to neutralize their forces." 33. The sects thus were regarded as an internal security threatand more specifically as a threat to the Diem government. By some in Saigon they were regarded as the major internal threat. 34 Long subsidized by the French as their partners in the Indochina war, and faced with the end of French financial assistance, major elements of the sect forces were integrated into the Vietnamese National Army; other elements, including the Hoa Hao forces of Ba Cut, were fragmented and reduced to low-level dissidence by government forces, according to contemporary intelligence estimates, by 1956. 35 There is some evidence that these fragmented groups were penetrated by the communists, however, and that they were used by the communists throughout the period. In this role the sects represented a continuing, if low-level, insurgent threat as an element in the overall internal security problem not qualitatively different from that repre ented by the communists themselves. 2. The Viet 'Minh Residue in South Vietnam was generally regarded as the instrument with which "the Communists" would pursue their "objective of securing control of all. Indochina." 36 Contemporary (1954) intelligence reports indicated the belief that ...the Viet Minh will seek to retain sizeable military and political assets in South Vietnam. Although the agreements provide for the removal to the north of all Viet Minh forces, many of the regular and irregular Viet Minh soldiers now in the south are natives of the area, and large numbers of them will probably cache their arms and remain in South Vietnam. In addition, Viet Minh administrative cadres have been in firm control of several large areas in Central and South Vietnam for several years. These cadres will probably remain in place 37 Later reports confirmed this statement and continued to describe the situation as "precarious." 38 Estimates during the period of relevance were consistent on the issue of control of the Viet Minh movement in the South They did not question unity of purpose among the communists of the north and south (or, for that matter, among the members of the communist bloc); they did continue to assert or infer that the Viet Minh in the south were under the control of the Viet Minh in the north. 39 Viet Minh force levels in the south were variously estimated by the U.S. during this period but never exceeded 10,000; GVN estimates, which tended to include all organized dissidents, were consistently lower than the U.S. estimates, never exceeding 8,000. Of 7these estimated dissidents, no more than some 2,000 were considered "active" by any available official estimate in the period 1954-1960. These forces were consistently estimated to be augmented by political and administrative cadre; 40 their modus operand! was seen as subversion and smallscale guerrilla operation.Thus the main internal threat to South Vietnam was viewed throughout the period as Hanoi-controlled subversion and small-scale guerrilla operations carried our primarily by military and political cadre of the Viet Minh. 3 The Vietnamese People's Army "continued evolution" into a regular military force during the last year of the French-Indochina war, 41 and in the period during which the U.S. was deciding to assume responsibility for organizing and training the South Vietnamese array the VBA was judged to be increasing its already formidable capabilities. 42 In April 1955, the regular VPA, "reorganized and strengthened since Geneva," was estimated to have increased in numbers to 240,000 (largely at the expense of the regional forces of 37,000 and the popular forces of 75,000) and to have been organized into 10 infantry divisions, 2 artillery divisions, 1 AAA groupment, and 25 independent infantry regiments. 43 Throughout the period 1954-1960 the VPA grew slowly and was consistently estimated to have the capability of defeating both French and Vietnamese forces were VPA forces to undertake an invasion of South Vietnam. It was generally assumed that these forces would be backed by Communist Chinese forces, if such backing proved necessary. Just as consistent as the high estimates of VPA capabilities were the estimates of the VPA's intentions the communists, although continuing to pursue their goal of controlling all of Indochina, would "without violating the armistice to the extent of launching an armed invasion to the south or west, pursue their objective by -political, psychological, and paramilitary means." 44 In the fall of 1954 it was reported that "the Viet Minh probably now feels that it can achieve control over all Vietnam without initiating large-scale warfare. Accordingly, we believe that the Communists will exert every effort to accomplish their objectives through means short of warIf, on the other hand, South Vietnam should appear to be gaining in strength or if elections were postponed over Communist objections, the Communists probably would step up their subversive and guerrilla activities in the South and if necessary would infiltrate additional armed forces in an effort to gain control over the area. However, we believe that they would unlikely openly to invade South Vietnam at least prior to July 1954" 45 The theme of political, psychological, and paramilitary operations as the communist method of securing its objectives was stressed 8 ,in all available estimates throughout the years 1954-1960. No U.S. estimate that it was likely the VPA would overtly invade South Vietnam during that period has been found; on the contrary, in spite of insistence by Diem that invasion by the DRV was a serious possibility, 46 U.S. estimates continued to stress that such an invasion was unlikely. In the words of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, engaged in the business of deter-mining U.S. policy in the event of aggression in Vietnam, "the Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that at this time the major threat to South Vietnam continues to be that of subversion" 4? In a somewhat later period it was stated that "The North Vietnamese Army is almost twice the size of the South Vietnamese Army. The threat posed by the large northern forces has put constant psycho-logical pressure on the GVN." 48 In view of the nature of the U.S. response to the combined threat posed by the sects, the Viet Minh in South Vietnam, and the VPA as reflected in the missions assigned the forces of South Vietnam, it would appear that this "constant psycho-logical pressure" had telling effects on U.S. as well as GVN policymakers. 9D. What was the mission of Vietnamese forces? The mission initially envisioned for the forces of Free Vietnam by the principal advocate of a U.S. role in organizing and trainingthose forces, the Secretary of State, was simply that of providing and maintaining security within the borders of their country, 49 and it was on this basis that the decision to assume responsibility for the organization and training of the Vietnamese National Army was taken. This single mission concept was in dispute, however, before, during, and after its pronouncement; the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in an attempt logically to trace through the web of U.S. commitments woven largely by the Secretary of State, were on the record in opposition to it; 50 and, in fact, by early 1956 a two- or three-fold mission for South Vietnamese forces was considered more or less established by the Chiefs and by others more directly concerned with the organization and training of the Vietnamese forces. 51 The evolution of the mission of the Vietnamese forces from that of maintaining internal security to (a) maintaining internal security; (b) resisting external aggression; and (c) contributing to regional defense with other non-Comiaunist countries was affected critically by five factors the state of U.S. strategic military policy in the mid-1950's; the nature of SEATO and of U.S. views concerning fulfillment of its commitments under that treaty; the withdrawal of the French Expeditionary Corps; pressures exerted by the Diem government; and recent U.S. experi-ences in Korea. 1. U.S, strategic military policy in the mid-l950's, as has been well documented, 52 was both complex and confused, and confusion over the issue of massive retaliation versus local defense was particular-ly intense. The JCS among others -- were unable ever to resolve the dilemma posed by U.S. policy in this regard with respect to the defense of Southeast Asia. The JCS had contended, first, that' "from the point of view of the United States, with reference to the Far East as a whole, Indochina is devoid of decisive presumably narrowly defined military objectives" 53 when considering U.S. intervention in the Indochina war, and that the main target of U.S. air and naval forces should be the source of the aggression (i.e., China). But they also contended both during and after the Indochina war that atomic weapons should be used within Vietnam in the local defense of that country and that if permission to use such weapons were denied (a spectre which appeared constantly to haunt the Chiefs), U.S. force requirements and the time required to achieve victory would soar. 53, 54 Finally, after the French defeat, the Chiefs argued that a ground defense against aggression from North Vietnam by South Vietnamese forces would be necessary to provide time for the U.S. to intervene with ground forces, again using atomic weapons for local defense. 2 10,Hhm 1.1'... --- Thus, although U.S. defense policy in the mid-1950 called for main but not solc reliance on nuclear weapons, and on use of massive retaliatory power in response to acts deemed hostile to the interests of the United States, definition of and planning for use of such weapons, in retaliation or otherwise, were so ambiguous, and the concepts themselves so unclear that, particularly when applied to specific remote local defense situations, their value as guidance was virtually nil. t 2. The nature of SEATO, and of U.S. views concerning fulfillment of its obligations under the SEATO treaty, necessarily reflected the confusion in overall U.S. defense policy and planning. Added to this general problem was the more specific matter of matching U.S. resources to the worldwide commitments, including SEATO, that had been assumed since the end of World War II. Thus the Joint Chiefs stated that "U.S. commitments to Formosa, Japan and Korea, which nations have been excluded from the .SEATO treaty, make it imperative that the United States not be restricted by force commitments in the subject treaty area; $6 these commitments must be added the numberous U.S. obligations outside Asia. As is well-known, theSEATO treaty, pressured into existence by the United States and intended to deter overt aggression by China or other Communist nations, relied heavily in concept on the military participation of the U.S. Faced with the magnitude of U.S. commitments, particularlyin relation to the capabilities of the defense establishment, and con-tinually confronted by the considerations and requirements of general war, the JCS sought a way in which U.S. SEATO obligations might be carried out 5- a. Continued development of combat effective indigenous forces, with their structure and training mutually coordinated to develop local leadership and prestige, and with improved capabilities to create a cohesive fighting force through integration of their operations with adjacent indigenous forces and with support by operations of forces of other Manila Pact members.b. Readiness to retaliate promptly with attacks, by the most effective combination of U.S. armed forces against the military power of the aggressor. c. Encouragement of other Manila Pact countries to maintain forces in readiness to counter aggression. d. Discussion, in general terms, of unilateral military plans by the Military Representatives to the Council to the extent necessary to insure maximum participation and cooperation by other member nations but not to the el-tent that U.S. strategic plans or the availability of U.S. forces for implementing such plans might be revealed. ,7 e. Periodic visits by U.S. forces into the area as demonstrations of intent, and for joint and combined training exercises. f. Availability of appropriate mechanism for the'employment of U.S. forces in support of friendly indigenous forces in support of friendly indigenous forces in the general area. ( 6. The concept of prompt retaliatory attacks does not envisage attacks on targets within the aggressor country other than on military targets involved in the direct support of the aggressor action. If authorized, atomic weapons would be used, even in a local situation, if such use will bring the aggression to a swift and positive cessation, and if, on a balance of political and military consideration, such use will best advance U.S. security interests. Under the alternative assumption that authority to use atomic weapons cannot be assured, the above concept would not require change, but this assumption would not permit the most effective employment of U.S. armed forces, and consequently might require greater forces than the U.S. would be justified in providing from the over-all point of view. 57 The clear intent of this concept -- in accordance with SEATO objectives -- is deterrence of and response to overt aggression against South Vietnam, among other countries; in view of limited U.S. resources, and of the recognition of this problem in NSC 1622, which "envisages reliance on indigenous ground forces to the maximum extent possible," 58 and in view of the psychological pressure generated by the powerful VPA, the logical consequence of assignment of the mission "to countery external aggression" to local South Vietnamese forces is virtually unavoidable. Therefore, the JCS stated their view and held to it throughout the period 1954-1960 -- "that the ultimate objectives of the military forces of the Associated States should be VIETNAM to attain and maintain internal security and to deter Viet Minh aggression by a limited defense of the Geneva Armistice demarcation line. 59 Although it was not until the publication of NSC 56121 in mid- 1956 that approved U.S. policy recognized this mission by stating that the U.S. should "assist Free Vietnam to build up indigenous armed forces, including independent logistical and administrative services, which will be capable of assuring internal security and of providing limited initial resistance to attack" by the Viet Minh," 60 unofficial U.S. policy, from the JCS in Washington through the MAAG in Vietnam, 61 had set in motion programs which implicitly assigned a mission of limited, initial resistance to Vietnamese forces which attempted to be both responsive to SEA.TO requirements and cognizant ofU.S. resource limitations. 12 ---, 3. The French Expeditionary Corps, with a force of 3.76,000 men in October 1954, figured heavily in U.S.-French plans for the defense of South Vietnam. In effect, the FEC was planned to be the shield behind which training of the VNA could be conducted, free of major concern over a Viet Minh attack across the 17th parallel. Unfortunate from the point of view of these plans were the major policy disputes that plagued -- and finally did in -- joint U.S.-French acti-vities in Vietnam. Dominant among U,S.-French disagreements were the French reluc- tance to support the Diem Government and the apparent French attitude of conciliation toward the Communists in both North and South Vietnam depends at a minimum on an early and convincing demonstration by the French of their wholehearted support." 62 It was particularly frustrating not only that no such "wholehearted support" was forthcoming but also that considerable evidence tended to support the belief that the French were actively attempting to overthrow Diem during the period they remained in Vietnam. 63 French reluctance to support Diem or, as the U.S. estimated, 1 I any nationalist government" 64 -- was consistent with their attitude toward Communist North Vietnam. Although Generals Collins and Ely enjoyed a cordial relationship of mutual trust, there is considerable evidence that Ely was, in a sense, the victim of both his superiors in the French Government and of his subordinates in Vietnam. Thus while Collins almost never expressed doubts regarding Ely's statements to him (and never of his integrity), French politics both high- and low-level, were particularly intense and seemed to be directed toward preservation of French commercial and cultural influence in both North and South Vietnam. The high-level French mission to Hanoi, the Saintenay Mission, was in particular regarded as evidence of French duplicity, although General Ely, in his memoirs, denies such duplicity. 65 Suspected French assistance to the sect forces opposing the Diem Government and French activities within the joint U.S.-French Training Relations Instruction Mission were also consistent with the policy of preservation of French interests. For some time U.S. policymakers had been thinking seriously about going it alone in Vietnam without the French. When at the Washing-ton Conference in September 1954, the Frcnch delegates discussed their intentions to cut the TEC to 100,000 by the end of 1955 and asked for $330 million in U.S. support for the FEC at that level, the reaction among U.S. decision makers was negative. On November 5 it was decided that on balance the U.S. would probably fare better in Vietnam without the French, and it was tentatively agreed that the U.S. should not con-tinue its support that had been requested, but should limit the contri-bution to $100 million. In their view a complete withdrawal of the FEC in 1955 Would create a vacuum that only the Viet Minh could fill, for the VNA would remain incapable of coping even with Viet Minh irregular forces  13,73 for at least that period. Furthermore, French cooperation was essential to the success of any U.S. project in Vietnam, and a decision to grant any support for the FEC would jeopardize French cooperation. 66 Although Heath and Collins prevailed and $100 million was allocated to support the FEC during 1955, the French were informed that no further assistance could be expected beyond that time. 67 The French responded by making it clear that a drastic reduction of the FEC was in the offing -- to a level of 40,000 by the end of 1955, and the Foreign Office emphasized that although this action was based entirely on monetary considerations there was also much sentiment in France for transferring the FEC to North Africa. In Vietnam, it was stated, French troops were serving the interests of the Free World; if the Free World would not pay their costs, then they should be sent to North Africa, where they would be serving the interests of France and the French Union. 68 Pressures applied by Diem also influenced the French exodus. Making no secret of his Franco-phobia, Diem asked the French to withdraw the FEC as early as September 1954, and in March 1955 Premier Faure announced that France would withdraw the FEC at the demand of the Vietnamese Government. By October 1955, the FEC had been reduced to 45,000; 69 by February 1956 only 15,000 remained; 70 and on April 1, 1956 the remnants of the FEC left Saigon, leaving only small Air Force and Navy training missions behind. With the dissolution of the French dissolution of the French high command on April 23, only the VNA was left to carry out the mission of guarding South Vietnam against aggression from the north, a mission which the French had been expected to perform. 4. The pressures exerted by the Diem Government on the U.S. regarding the Vietnamese National Army were consistently in favor of larger forces than the U.S. was willing to support 71 and in the criti-cally formative .years of 1954 and 1955 were oriented toward regular forces organized to combat an invasion from the north as well as to pro-vide internal security. Just as Diem had felt the FEC should be deployed along the 17th parallel, 72 he believed that the VNA should be manned and organized in such a way as to counter any such invasion, although "from the earliest days senior Vietnamese officers, including General Minh, argued for the creation of an effective grass-roots security organisation in the countryside. They knew how the war had been fought and lost. Diem at first had no idea. While the Viet Minh tactics were changing from attrition to annihilation, Diem was abroad. He returned with the opinion that aircraft and naval craft were the essentials and that even infantry were no necessary. -Later he developed an attachment to artillery By the time he came round to accenting the advice of his own generals, the United States had embarked on its major plans for major reorganization, and the paramilitary forces, which Diem had created in a half-hearted way, were withering on the vine." 735. Recent U.S. experiences in Korea were of two kinds a tre- mendous effort to counter an invasion by a large Communist conventional army across a parallel of latitude with a large conventional army composed primarily of U.S. and U.S.-trained "native" troops; and an antiguerrilla effort so miniscule as to be accorded to U.S. forces and less than half a short paragraph in General Matthew B. Ridgway's 291-page book on the Korean war. ...So it seemed a good time in November 19517 to take care of a persistent annoyance -- the existence of large bands of guerrillas in South Korea, particularly in the mountainous areas northwest of Chinju, where they had taken refuge after the Communist retreat. Van Fleet assigned Lieutenant General Paik Sun Yup, with two ROK divisions, to Operation RATKILLER, designed to rid us of this potentially dangerous threat. By the end of January 1952, nearly 20,000 freefooters -- bandits and organized guerrillas -- had been killed or captured and the irritation was ended for good. 74 In view of the Korean experience, not yet two years old at the time of O'Daniel's assumption of responsibility and training of the Vietnamese National Army, it is hardly surprising that the mission of defense, however limited, of the 17th parallel was envisioned for these Vietnamese forces to complement the more limited mission of achieving and maintaining internal security. Nor perhaps is it surprising that this mission came to dominate the organization and training of the VNA. E. What was the state of the South Vietnamese Army? While the U.S. was still in the process of taking the decision to assume responsibility for organizing and training the Vietnamese army, NIE-63-7-54 reported on the condition of that army- Related documents give no reason to suspect the accuracy of this estimate or to believe the estimate overstates the magnitude of the tasks the U.S. was about to undertake 23. The Vietnamese National Army has an estimated strength of 170,000 regulars and 10,000 auxiliaries. Naval and air strength is negligible. The regulars include 5 infantry regiments and 152 combat battalions, of which 69 are infantry, 61 light infantry, 8 guard, 5 airborne infantry, 8 artillery, and one armored reconnaissance. The regroupment necessitated by the Geneva Agreemcnts has forced many units to leave their home provinces for the first tirne, resulting in a considerable number of desertions since 1 June (up to 25 percent of the total army strength). Some auxiliaries and other semimilitary forces are being demobilized, with the exception of the armed forces of the South Vietnamese sects and certain guard and militia elements. 15 . The Vietnamese General Staff has become so involved in political affairs that it has neglected the required planning of an ade-quate internal security program. This neglect has fostered a spirit of insubordination' and irresponsibility throughout the army. The army in some instances has been incapable of execut-ing occupation and pacification operations in areas formerly under Viet Minh control. Almost all units, particularly those from North Vietnam, require a-period of intensive training and reorganization to bring them up to strength and improve their effectiveness. 24. Advisory and training aid is provided by approxirately 4,800 French officers and NCOs currently serving in the French Military Mission to Vietnam. This mission is to be increased to 6,000 by the end of 1954. These individuals serve in command, staff, and advisory roles on the Vietnamese General. Staff in the territorial command structure, and in training establishments. About 20 percent of Vietnamese infantry units and 50 percent of support and technical units are cadred at least partially by the French. The array is still under French operational control and continues to be completely dependent on the French for logistic support. 25. A major reason for the ineffectiveness of the Vietnamese National Army is its lack of adequately trained officers. Only about one percent have received training roughly equivalent to that of a US army officer of field grade and virtually none has a comparable background of staff and command experience. Very few of the Vietnamese officers would be competent even in assignments justified by their training and experience, and even fewer are capable of an adequate performance at the higher positions of responsibility which they now hold. Their back-ground is one of subordination to French command, and they are inclined to rely heavily on French advisers even when given positions of authority and responsibility. 26. The other serious deficiencies in the South Vietnamese national forces, ineffective organization and training and absence of logistics and technical services, are related to the lack of leadership and stem from the same basic cause, i.e., French failure to train and develop qualified leaders. This situation can be resolved only over a period of time and only if an intensive program for the progressive development of an effective officer corps is soon initiated. 28. We have little information on the strength and status of other semi-military and police forces 29 South Vietnam's mobilisable manpower pool is estimated at 1,500,000 physically fit, military-age males, of which about 20 percent are now under arras. An additional 10 percent could 16, probably be mobilized without initially curtailing essential economic activities. The Vietnamese Government would be almost entirely dependent- upon foreign aid to support such a force. 30. The Diem Government proposes to expand the army to 200,000 by the end of 1954, and to 225,000 by the end of 1955 By the latter date, the army would include 10 divisions plus 60 territorial battalions. The cost of maintaining these forces through 1955 has been estimated at about $450,000,000 of which almost all would have to be furnished by external assistance. The French have supported this proposal as being required A proposal for development of a National Guard under the Ministry of the Interior has been postponed pending the outcome of French- Vietnamese-United States discussions. 31. On the other hand, the United States is considering the reduction of the Vietnamese army to about 80,000, including 3 combat light divisions. These reduced forces would have pri-marily an internal security mission. Against a large-scale Viet Minh invasion, they would serve only as a delaying force. Cost of maintaining the forces at the reduced levels has been tenta-tively estimated at about $200,000,000 per year. This estimated cost is in addition to financial, economic, and military support funds, which might total $150,000,000 per year. 75Thus a listing of problems and deficiencies to be dealt with would contain at least the following force size; force structure; disengage-ment of general staff from political affairs; planning of an internal security program; planning of a delaying strategy to counter invasion from the north; correction of a spirit of insubordination and irresponsi-bility; replacing French cadre; developing a self-reliant officer corps; developing an independent logistics capability; developing adequate technical services; development of training system and program; learning about and coping with the problems of semi-military and police forces; resolving the problem of the National Guard. F. How did the U.S. go about altering the state of the VNA? With the JCS-recommended force levels for Indochina forwarded to Secretary of Defense on 22 November 1954, the upper bound of the regular Vietnamese army force goals was established at 184,000; 76 the taking into account of the objections of Secretary of State, who regarded this force level as "excessive" to the mission of establishing and maintain-ing internal security, 77 setthe lower-bound goal of approximately 88,000. The earliest U.S. actions toward the VNA were devoted to reduc-ing- the VNA to this lower level while reorganizing the forces in order to rectify as many as possible of the problems listed above. 17, Although at this stage MAAG was charged solely with the task of assisting the Vietnamese to develop a force capable of establishing and maintaining internal security, the second mission of limited resistance to an onslaught from the north was reflected in General Collins1 recommendations of 15 November. In recommending a force level of some 88,000, General Collins indicated his belief that divisional combat elements should be included in the force structure to assist the FEC to absorb the shock of invasion if hostilities were renewed as well as, if called upon, to reinforce the security troops in pacification activities. General Collins also contended that to reduce the VNA by half without at the same time providing forces organized for combat rather than merely for security duty was certain to have a bad effect on Vietnamese morale. 78 Accordingly, General Collins recommended that the U.S. support a small, weIl-balanced force including 13 security regiments and an airborne RCT for internal security purposes and a three-field-division force to delay any Communist invasion until external assistance from the Manila powers could arrive. A small navy and air force were recommended to complete the Vietnamese defense establishment. On 17 November the JCS approved Collins' recommendations, emphasizing, however, that this program "does not provide t 'equate security for the Associated States against external aggression after the withdrawal of the French forces. With the Viet Minh increasing the size and effectiveness of their forces and with no force in being committed to mutual defense under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the above long-range program would be insufficient to provide more than limited initial resistance to an organised military assault by the Viet Minh." 00 In his report of 20 January, Collins expanded on this recom-nended force structure, a structure "based on the concept that a relatively small force, properly trained, equipped and led can perform the above missions more effectively and at less cost than a larger force which would be disproportionate to the economic and manpower capacities of the country." 811 The task of assuring that Vietnamese forces were properly trained, equipped, and led fell initially to the Training Relations Instruction Mission (TRIM), a joint U.S.-French enterprise under USMAAG Chief O'Daniel. Although the Collins-Ely minute of understanding did not go into effect until 12 February 1955, ODaniel had begun to implement that agreement in 1954 by organizing TRIM, which consisted of all French and U.S. advisory and training personnel as well as French cadres with Vietnamese units, for this purpose. 32 During 1955, TRIM occupied itself with organizing a military school system, setting up programs for training officers and specialists in the U.S. and other countries, and reducing the language barrier. Much time and thought went into planning for reorganizing and training the army on a divisional rather than a battalion badis, but TRIM accomplished little in this area during 18, 1955 because of the continued employment of the VILA against the sects and because of the French phaseout, which was well underway during that year. 83 The continuing conflict with sect forces, the reduction and eventual withdrawal cf the FEC, the lack of a capability to demobilize efficiently, concern about overloading the economy with unemployed veterans (potential grist for the sectstand for the Communists' mill), and the fact that the 88,00O-nan VNA was viewed as only slightly larger than the sect forces alone led the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense (MOD)to object to the 88,000 force level in 1954. As a first compromise, CHMAAG indicated that the U.S. would agree to supporting a goal of 100,000 by the end of 1955J the same factors led to O'Daniel's recommendation of a goal of U.S.-supported forces of 150,000 (plus 10,000 sect-troops) by 1 July 1954. 8. Ambassador Reinhardt and CINCPAC fully endorsed ODaniels recommendation, and the JCS recommended approval of this force basis. 85 Upon DOD approval, MAAG immediately began planning for the reorganization of Vietnamese forces "according to American concepts" 86 and at the newly approved level. The organizing and training of this force of 4 field divisions, 6 light divisions, 13 territorial regiments, 1 airborne RCT, and supporting troops, plus an air force and navy of limited size, was to occupy MAAG until the reorganization of 1959. 87 To accomplish this task, MAAG had a total strength of 342 officers and men, of which 220 were assigned TRIM in February 1955. With the French withdrawing personnel engaged in processing MDAP equipment, MAAG found it difficult to supervise redistribution and end use of this material. 88 As early as February, before the French began to withdraw, O'Daniel had reported he needed twice the authorised MAAG strength to accomplish this mission; 89 both O'Daniel and CINCPAC argued against the State Departments interpretation that Article 16 of the Geneva Agreement held MAAG to a ceiling of 342 personnel and the JCS recommended "that the Secretary of Defense inform the National Security Council of the gravity of the situation in Vietnam, requesting the authority to raise the 342 limitation;" ,90 and the Secretary of Defense, in forwarding these dissenting views to the Secretary ofState, agreed with the dissenter. 1 Before the Secretary of State could reply to the DOD inquiry, an interagency costing team which had just returned from Vietnam reported that because of the reduction in French personnel control of MDAP supplies and spaces had been lost and that as a result, "the capability of supply of forces in the field in the event hostilities should be resumed in mid-!956 would be virtually non-existent." 92 On February 3 1956, the Department of State acquiesced in the creation of the Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission (TERM). 53 By the end of 1956, this group of 350 military personnel had greatly facili-ta.te.d the recovery and redistribution of MDAP equipment; although they n 1 1 '-" 19 . were not part of MAAG, they had also improved the organization of Vietnamese logistical services and had launched an extensive logistical training program.In addition, TERM relieved MAAG of logistical responsibilities, thus freeing MAAG personnel for training, pl There-after, the MAAG training program "gained momentum." 95 This momentum was in the direction of training and organizing the VNA so that it would have its proper role in the overall defense of Vietnam as had already been envisioned by the MAAG in 1955 (1) The organization and missions of the National Army, Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps all supplementary in assur-ing adequate internal security for Free Vietnam. The National Army retains overall responsibility for internal security in accordance with its assigned mission. The development of the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps as supplementary internal security agencies will, at nominal cost, provide for increased internal security and simultaneously afford necessary relief of army units for necessary combat training, thus greatly increasing the potential of Free Vietnam to resist armed aggression from without, coordinated with guerrilla and sub-versive action from within. (2) The Civil Guard will be responsible for (a) nation-wide civil law enforcement except in those, cities having municipal police, (b) supplementing the Army Territorial Regiments in maintain internal security, and (c) serving as an operating agency for the Vietnamese Bureau of Investigation in the collection of anti-subversive intelligence. The Civil Guard will possess the necessary mobility to concentrate against strong subversive actions, supplementing and lending breadth to the .Array Territorial Battalions (3) Neither the Army nor the Civil Guard will have the necessary strength, dispersion or familiarity to provide neces-sary protection for widely scattered and numerous (approximately 6,000) villages against subversive actions of Viet Minh cadres and dissident sect personnel. The Self-Defense Corps, operating with lO-men armed units in each village, would possess these requirements to the degree necessary to ferret out and eliminate existent or potential subversive movements The Ariry and the Self-Defense Corps will have the same command channels Close coordination will exist between Self-Defense Corps units and the Civil Guard on the lower levels, 6 No concept for defending Free Vietnam could be clearer the regular army in command of (or in close coordination with) the irregulars who will have the capability to free the army to fill an army role "to resist armed aggression from without." Unfortunately, however sound this 20, concept may have been and in view of demonstrated Viet Cong and DRV flexibility it is not clear that the concept was completely unsound --it was never successfully implemented. The VNA, gradually transformed into ARVN, was organized and trained along U.S. lines (at least in the view of those doing, the training and reporting on their progress 7 and by the end of 1958 MEAG was able to state that "The combat posture of the Vietnamese Armed Forces has 'improved to a marked degree in the past few years. At the end of CY 1958, the Vietnamese Army, compared with other army forces in Southeast Asia, reached a relatively high degree of combat effectiveness" 8 But the Civil Guard and the Self-Defense Corps were never brought to the stage of development at which they might have relieved the army of the internal security mission for which its new-found organisation, training, and equipment were rendering it unfit. As far as can be estimated on the basis of available information, training within Vietnam was conducted in as centralized a fashion as possible. Limited availability of personnel end GVN opposition pre-cluded posting of U.S. advisors to lower than airborne brigade level until 1961, although the need for advisors at lower levels was well recognized. 99 Training methods were, as far as can be judged, standard U.S. methods minimally adapted to the Vietnamese context; standard training cycles similar to U.S. programs were employed; ex-tensive use was made of translated U.S. training films and training and field manuals. Extensive training of Vietnamese officers in the U.S. was conducted. Combat and support units, especially logistics units, benefited equally from U.S. methods and procedures. Equipment (including personal gear) reflected U.S. taste in kind, if not in quality. And U.S. organizational preferences became fully realized when, in 1959, the agitation begun by General ODaniel during the Indo-china war had its full flowering in the reorganization of the Vietnamese Army into a General Headquarters, Field Command, six Military Region Headquarters, two Corps Headquarters and Corps Troops, one provisional Corps Headquarters, and seven standard divisions of 10,500 men each. By 1959 these forces were judged capable of maintaining internal security and of providing limited initial resistance to any renewed aggression from the North. 100 In spite of all this progress, however, MAAG statements in 1959 reveal that many of the problems and deficiencies found in the VILA of 1954 and noted above were still to be found in the ARVN of 1959 101 although force size had been settled by fiat, it was still a troublesome problem particularly vis-a-vis the GVN which persisted in its desire for larger forces; force structure was still unclear, particularly with reference to command and control; as the abortive coup of 1960 was to show, high-ranking officers were still politically active; 131 plans for an internal security program, relied heavily on the virtually non-existent capabilities of the Civil Guard and Self-Defcnse Corps;correction of a spirit of insubordination and irresponsibility was not complete, as revealed at low as well as high (or "coup") levels 103 French cadre had been replaced, but with Vietnamese cadre generally less well-adapted to their role; a self-reliant officer corps was still a vision of the future, as were an independent logistics capability and adcquate technical services; and although something had been learned about the problems of semi-military and police forces, not enough had been done to cope with them to provide genuine internal security. t There were, in fact, several views of the roles and missions of the paramilitary forces. The Michigan State University Advisory Group, under contract to USOM, Vietnam to provide counsel and guidance on the development of the Civil Guard (CG), viewed this organisation as a national police, civilian in character and function, lightly but adequately equipped, with sufficient delegated authority and training to enforce all laws, con-trol subversion, and collect intelligence data in areas not covered by municipal police, as well as establishing close ties with the population of the rural areas by fixed basing in the villages within pacified areas. 104 Diem envisaged the CG as a large and powerful military organization accountable to him through his appointed province chiefs -- a counter to the army in the struggle for power which would also provide provincial security through mobility from posts outside the villages; in line with this view, he transferred the CG from the Ministry of the Interior to thePresidency in 1956. The USMAAG came to view the CG much as Diem did --not, of course, as an anti-coup safeguard, but as a mobile countersubver-sion force, an adjunct to the army that would relieve it of internal security duty and free it to learn how to counter the threat from the North. 105 As of the end of 1956 the CG were being trained at the Quang Trung School to assist the army in case of crisis or of overt attack; 106 by late 1957, they were conducting operations with ARVN in unpacified areas. 107 The MSU Advisory Group, in a 1-956 report, 108 outlined the problems that existed with respect to the problems of the several Vietnamese law enforcement agencies, including the CG, and made far-reaching recommenda-tions, some of which were reiterated in the Counterinsurgency Plan of 1960. 109 This reiteration supports the hypothesis that few of the MSU recommendations were actcd upon effectively in the intervening years. In July 1957, the GVN requested $60 million worth of heavy equipment for the CG, which had been equipped only with non-U.S. weapons surplusto the army's requirements. MAAG and MSU proposed $1418 million in lighter equipment; in 1958, a compromise was reached, providing for only $14 million but including some of the heavy equipment to be issued over a U-year period with the understanding that the CG be reorganized into a civilian operation under the Ministry of Interior and along lines proposed by U.S. advisors, up Little progress was made in changing the Civil Guard, however, in spite of this U.S. leverage; the $14 million in 22, assistance was withheld for almost two years. In January 1959, Diem agreed to transfer the CG to the Minister of the Interior, and the U.S. agreed to go ahead with the aid program. The new Public Safety Division of USOM assumed responsibility for training the CG in June, but the impasse over the concept of the CG continued until December 1960, when Dien, at MAAGs urging, transferred the CG to the DOD. 111 The Self-Defense Corps (SDC), like the CG, was armed with non-U.S. weapons surplus to the army's requirements. Established by Diem as a part of the DOD, the SDC received U. S. assistance from its inception in the form of a $6 million per year subsidy for salaries. All reports indicate that the SDC was in even worse shape than the CG. The contro-versy that engulfed both these organizations for five years produced two paramilitary units that, far from being adequate to free the army for "combat," were confusingly organized, inadequately equipped, poorly trained, and badly led even when compared with ARVN. 112 According to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College "Study on Army Aspects of the Military Assistance Program in Vietnam," published in June 1960, 113 "The Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam are anxious to take the offensive and 'march to Hanoi.' The Chief, MAAG, and his principal assistants who come in direct contact with the Viet- namese high command must be constantly alert to detect this desire and any evidence of preparations therefor, as the consequences of such a premature act, not only to the numerically inferior South Vietnamese Armed Forces,but also to the entire region end possibly the whole world, could be most serious." Given the deficiencies remaining in the seven standard division regular army that would do the marching, and the state of the paramilitary forces, the authors of this study were well advised to add, parenthetically and perhaps wistfully "(Eventual reunification through 'peaceful means is to be hoped for.) TO'P SECRET  23, G. Did U.S, assistance through 1960 result in creation of a South Vietnamese Army in the image of the U.S. Army? while it would probably be incorrect to assert that the U.S. created a complete "mirror image" of its own forces in thc Vietnamese defense estab- lishment, consideration of the mission, strategy, tactics, organizations, manpower policy, equipment, and training of that establishment indicates that conscious and unconscious U.S. efforts did result in emphasis on conventional forces (at the expense of paramilitary forces) "governed by the concept of a war front enabling use of the superior weaponry and technology of the West against a guerrilla force that was potentially the spearhead of a more mas-sive thrust out of North Vietnam." 114 1. Evolution of the mission of the VITA has been described. The fact is that assignment of a dual mission to VNA led rapidly to formation of a regular military establishment designed primarily to counter the threat of overt invasion from the North. Countering the internal threat--as is so often the casewas downgraded to the status of a "lesser-included capa-bility in the regular forces." 115 2. The strategy of the regular establishment was described as early as 1956 as defensive in nature and involves the conduct of a delaying action against external aggression of sufficient duration and effec-tiveness to hold as much ground as possible, and retain the key strategic entity, the Saigon Complex, in order to permit the arrival of the foreign military assistance which will be neceS-sary to preserve her territorial integrity and national sovereignty This defensive strategy must not only include consideration of the enemy threat in the form of overt military aggression from outside her borders but also from separate or concurrent extensive guerrilla and clandestine activities conducted by indigenous dis-sident groups or foreign military and political cadres already present or infiltrated into the country. '-.16 The latter threat was countered by the territorial regiments in 1956; these regiments were abolished in 1959, with thadvent of the 7 standard division force. Thus on the strategic level the regular forces came to reflect the strategy evolved by the U.S. in Korea and elsewhere. 3. On the tactical level the Vietnamese forces also came to re- flect standard U.S. doctrine--with one possible exception, that of "paci-fication." Thus the tactical doctrine which will probably emerge from the present 71956 reorganization and training period will most likely TOP-SECRETScnsitive 24, reflect past, relatively small-unit, infantry-type operations under the French; the inherently mobile infantry nature of the present forces influenced by increased firepower; a capability for coordinated operations up to division and eventually corps level; and increased service and logistical support for the essentially infantry-type forces. Mobility and increased infantry firepower will dictate the utilization of essentially infantry tactics The VNA jyillf adopt a highly mobile tactical doctrine characterized by extensive movement and maneuvering of the main body with extensive mining and ambuscades. 11r( The preponderant evidence gleaned from ARVN experience against the Viet Cong supports the hypothesis that ARVN tactics, influenced by the factors listed above, rapidly evolved toward relatively large-scale operations, heavily reliant on increased prepower including artillery and air support, and away from "relatively small-unit, infantry-type operations," again reflecting U.S. practice, if not U.S. doctrine, in countering large-scale aggression. The concept and tactics of the pacification mission, unlike those of countering aggression, required particular concentration on specialized methods of dealing with the local populace as well as countering insurgents. Thus the Saigon Military Mission reported that as a result of its teaching efforts, Troops were courteous, they had constructed a school and were holding classes for both children and adults with Army volunteers as teachers, they had helped rebuild the marketplace and church, they carried out active patrolling, and they had placed locked boxes to receive information and suggestions from the population. People responded to the treatment. In a few days they started being friendly with the troops (something usually reserved for Communist troops in Asian countries) and, after a Viet Minh hand-grenade attack on the marketplace, information about names and locations of the Viet Minh cadres started to flow to the Army from the people. 118 In spite of this apparent good start, MAAG Country Statements from 1955 to 1959 are silent on the subject of training for pacification, although National Security Action, as pacification was then called, was actually underway. This is a reasonably good indication of how important this set of concepts and tactics was regarded by MAAG officers. 11 In fact, quite the opposite was the case MAAG reports constantly complained of the diversion of the Vietnamese Army from unit training to pacification, without suggesting that specialized training in the tactics of this mission might be useful. 4 The clear inference is that the orthodoxy of U.S. tactical doctrine prevailed. 4. The organization of the defense establishment in general reflected the U.S. practices insofar as it was feasible to persuade the Diem 25 . government to adopt them. 2-2j Available evidence indicates that the standard ARVN division of 1959 patterned after the 1956 U.S. Army division-- reduced in scale, and without organic armor, aviation, and band. Each ARVN standard division had 10,450 men organized in three regiments, each of which was capable of independent action and could be broken into company-size task forces. Each division had two artillery battalions equipped with towed 105 mm howitzers and 4.2" mortars, one engineer battalion, and technical and logistics support companies. The seven divisions were formed into two Corps. There were also four armor battalions, one airborne brigade, one marine group, one air force fighterbomber squadron, two C-47 transport squadrons, two light aircraft observation squadrons, and one squadron of helicopters. 12? In 1964 Lieutenant General Samuel T. Williams (Chief MAAG Vietnam 1955-60) during the course of an interview was asked whether MAAG had created the Vietnamese Division in the image of the American Division. His vehement denial included the statement that "Actually, there was little similarity between the South Vietnamese division in existence then 19597 or now fyS&C." 12% However, an examination of the following table and figures indicates that there were more similarities than differences in the overall structure of the two organizations. All of the technical services were to be found in the 1959 ARVN Division, although at somewhat reduced strength in some cases. Division artillery was 50 percent heavier in the U.S. Division and was concentrated in 105 ram howitzer battalions with some 155 mm, 8-inch and 763 mm weapons. The ARVN Division had a 4.2-inch mortar battalion in addition to the 105 mm battalion. Maneuver units, the regiments of the U.S. and ARVN Division, were about equal in strength. Both regiments contained a mortar company. There were more regiments in the U.S. Division (5) as opposed to ARVN's 3, and the U.S. regiments were divided into rifle companies (4 per regiment). In the ARVN Division there was an intermediate battalion echelon. In this respect the 1959 ARVN Division more closely resembled the 7-11R Regiment of the U.S. Army 7R Division (1955) This regiment type was heavier than both the ROCID 7-11T Infantry Regiment and the ARVN 1959 Regiment and was evidently capable of more sustained operations, since it had organic support units attached to it including a company of tanks. A similar regiment (7-11R) without the technical support units was supposed to provide the division with the flexibility to conduct operation with task forces of any size, a stated goal of the authors of the ARVN Divisional reorganization, lt Thus, while the mirror image accusation is not entirely correct, neither is the denial that there were no similarities between the U.S. and ARVN Division. The evidence available suggests that clearly the blueprint for the 1959 ARVrl Division reorganization was to be found in the TOE's of the U.S. Army. 5. Manpower policies in Vietnam in the late 1950's resulted in allocation of the best personnel to the Vietnamese Armed Forces. 26 ro COMPARISON OF U.S. 7T ROCID INFANTRY DIVISION (1956) AND ARVN STANDARD DIVISION (1959) (U) Iten or Unit U.S. 7T ROCID Inf Div 1956 ARVN 1959 Inf Div Haye Strength Have Strength Yes No Yes No Division Total Strength Div Hq & Hq Co Tank Bn Arm'd Car Bn.

This insatiable requirement for the "best" men to build up the officer corps was in part a reflection of the requirements of the South Vietnamese social structure; in any event, it was much closer to the conventional U.S. view of an officer corps than to the view of Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap, and reflected the view that well-schooled men are required to manage complex modern armies. 6. The equipment provided the Vietnamese regular forces was more suited to countering aggression from the North than to preserving internal security in the South. While ARVN were not equipped as heavily as those of the U.S.--they had no tracked vehicles (tanks or personnel carriers), fewer trucks, and generally lighter weapons--727 trucks, 660 trailers--to make them mechanized and road-bound. Armor was provided, but was not organic to the standard division. ..U.S. military aid was programmed in more or less the same fashion as for countries like Turkey and Korea, where guerrillas were not a threat. The Vietnamese armed forces not only were equipped with tanks, planes, artillery and similar hardware that was relatively little value against guerrrillas as the French had discovered so painfully and the Pentagon apparently had not noticed. They were also trained to depend on that kind of big bang support in battle, reducing both their capability and their psychological willingness to get out and fight the guerrillas the only way that works with rifles, close in. 126 7. That the training of the Vietnamese armed forces was conducted along U.S. lines has been documented above. Between 1950 and 1959 (1) 3,296 Vietnamese military personnel had received training in military facilities in the United States, while 74? had been trained in other Free World military schools. 12 k (2) Training films, manuals and lesson plans were those used by the U.S. military adapted to Vietnamese culture and environment. 127'(3) The U.S. was particularly proud of its accomplishments in the training of armed forces in Korea, where a large conventionally organized force had proven itself in the combat recently expericnced there. l-i  30,. These factors, then--the dual mission, strategy, tactics, organization, manpower policy, equipment, and training--a11 directly contributed to the formation of a Vietnamese military establishment, and in parti-cular to an ARVN, that in 1960 bore overall resemblance to the U.S.military establishment and particularly close resemblance to the U.S. Army. Unfortunately, events since 1960 have demonstrated that the ARVN was not well-suited to countering the internal security threat; its efficacy against overt aggression still remains to be tested. 31,FOOTNOTES, Iw C.
