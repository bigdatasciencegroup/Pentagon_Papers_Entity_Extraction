SUMNtMW AND ANALYSIS       MILITARY PRESSURES AGAINST NVN JULYOCTOBER, 1964 SUMMARY and ANALYSIS During the spring and summer of 1964, there was disquiet about the situation in South Vietnam and disillusion with on-going U.S. actions to right that situation. During the third quarter of 1964, a consensus developed within the Johnson Administration that some form of continual overt pressures mounting in severity against North Vietnam soon would be required. The purpose of these pressures was twofold (1) to effect DRV will and capabilities in order to persuade and force the leadership in Hanoi to halt their supnort and direction of the war in the South; and (2) to induce negotiations at some future point in time on our terms after North Vietnam had been hurt and convinced of our resolve. This consensus was in an early formative stage -- it had become an idea, not a program for action; it was a belief, not as yet fully staffed and considered. Because of this and because of important tactical consideratrons (the impending U.S. elections, the instability of the GVN, and the need to produce further evidence of VC infiltration into the South) implementation of such a policy was deferred. Nevertheless, the groundwork was being laid. The Tonkin Gulf reprisal constituted an important firebreak, and the Tonkin Gulf Resolution set U.S. public support for virtually any action. Since the fall of Diem in November 1963, the political situation in South Vietnam had been deteriorating. The Khanh Government had succeeded Minh in January .1964, but had demonstrated only greater capacity for surviv-ability, not more capacity for reversing the trend toward collapse. In the wake of the Tonkin Gulf reprisals, when South Vietnamese morale was still temporarily inflated, Khanh made a bold bid to consolidate his personal power and impose semi-dictatorial rule. He was brought to heel, however, in less than a month by the military junta which continued to operate behind the scenes. By September, the most salient aspect of the confused political situation in South Vietnam was the likelihood that it would continue its downward slide into the foreseeable future. In this setting, a program of covert military pressures against North Vietnam already had been set in process. These were basically of three kinds (1) low level recce with armed escort over Laos; (2) De Soto patrols within 4 n.m. of the NVN coast to acquire visual, electronic, and photo-graphic intelligence; and (3) Oplan 34-A which included a variety of anti-infiltration, sabotage, and psywar measures. The portent of these actlons was being conveyed to the North Vietnamese through private and public channels. A Canadian, Blair Seaborn, was sent to Hanoi to state that U.S. objectives were limited but that our commitment was deep, and that "in the event of escalation the greatest devastation would of course result for the DRVN itself."  i .      Neither the situation in SVN nor the failure of Hanoi to acquiesce to our threats diminished the basic U.S. commitment. NSAM 288 expounding the need to do what was necessary to preserve an "independent non-communist South Vietnam" was the guiding policy document. At no time in this period was the NSAM 288 commitment brought into question. Rather, American con-cern was focused on how the U.S. could retrieve the situation. The usual palliatives more aid, more advice, more pressure on the GVN to reform, and more verbal threats to Hanoi were no longer seen as sa.tisfactory. Nor did it appear to U.S. decision-makers that we faced a stark choice between complete U.S. withdrawal from the struggle or a large scale intro-duction of U.S. ground forces. Nor did the leadership in Washington believe that a massive bombing campaign against the North need be seriously considered although such a program was proposed by the JCS. With all these alternatives implicitly ruled out at this time, the choice was both obvious and inevitable. Although it did not take the form of decision, it was agreed that the U.S. should at an unspecified date in the future begin an incre-mental series of gradually mounting strikes against North Vietnam. The only real questions were precisely what actions should be taken and when? None of these early fall discussions in Washington really confronted the hard issues of what a bombing campaigil would buy and what it would cost. These hard-headed discussions, to some extent, took place in the last few months of 1964. The key events in this period were the Tonkin Gulf incidents of August 2nd and 4th and the U.S. reprisal on North Vietnam PT boats and bases on August 5th. The explanation for the DRV attack on U.S. ships remains puzzling (perhaps it was simply a way of warning and warding off U.S. patrols close to North Vietnam borders). The swift U.S. reaction was to be expected. While there was some momentary uncertainty about the actuality of the second attack on August 4th, confirming evidence of the attack was received before the U.S. reprisal was launched. The U.S. reprisal represented the carrying out of recommendations made to the President by his principal advisers earlier that summer and subsequently placed on the shelf. The existence of these previous recommendations with planning down to detailed targeting made possible the immediate U.S. reaction when the crisis came. At the same time as U.S. reprisals were taken, President Johnson decided to act on another recommendation that had been under consideration since at least May a Congressional resolution of support for U.S. policy. Whereas in the earlier discussions, such a resolution had been proposed as a vehicle for mobilizing Congressional and public support behind an escalating campaign of pressures against the North, the President, in the midst of an election campaign, now felt impelled to use it to soliuify support for his overall Vietnam policy. On August 5th he sent a message to Congress on the Tonkin incidents and asked for passage of a joint resolution endorsing his policy. The resolution itself was one prepared by the Administration and introduced on its behalf by the Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees in the two Houses. It was passed with near unanimous support'on August 7th.        The net effect of the swift U.S. reprisals and the Congressional Resolution was to dramatically demonstrate, publicly state and formally record the commitments to South Vietnam and within Southeast Asia that had been made internal U.S. policy by NSAM 288 in March 1964. They were also conceived and intended as a clear communication to Hanoi of what it could expect if it continued to pursue its current course of action. They were portents of the future designed to demonstrate the firmness of U.S. resolve and the direction its policy was tending. The psychological impact of the raids on the Administration and the American public is also significant. They marked the crossing of an important threshold in the war, and it was accomplished with virtually no domestic criticism, indeed, with an evident increase in public support for the Administration. The precedent for strikes against the North was thus established and at very little apparent cost. There was a real cost, however. The number of unused measures short of direct military action against the North had been depleted. Greater visible commit-ment was purchased at the price of reduced flexibility. But, a worried Administration went to some lengths to insure that the strikes did not bind or commit it to any future policies or actions and to have it understood that the strikes, had been pure and simple reprisals of the one of a kind variety. Yet, for all these reasons, when a decision to strike the North was faced again, it was much easier to take. The Tonkin reprisals were widely regarded within the Administration as an effective, although limited demonstration of the firmness of American resolve. However, they also served to stiffen that resolve and to deepen the commitment. Several officials within the Administration, including Ambassador Taylor, felt that to have any lasting impact this demonstration of resolve would have to be followed up by other continuing actions, in an increasing tempo. Tile positive short-term effect of the reprisals in raising South Vietnamese morale was noted as an important by-product of the strikes and offered as one justification for continuing pressures against the North. Also figuring importantly in calculations of resolve and intent was the appreciable improvement in our position in Laos as a result of the vigorous spring offensive by Laotian Government forces. This improvement had led us to oppose a l4-nation conference on Laos for fear of placing the new gains in jeopardy, and convinced many that only military measures were unambiguously understood by Hanoi's communist rulers. This, however, was tempered by- a countervailing concern not to provoke by U.S. action any communist military escalation in Laos. Quite another set of arguments for strikes against the North were advanced by Walt Rostov, then Counselor of the State Department, in a paper that circulated widely through the Administration in August 1964. The "Rostow Thesis" argued that externally supported insurgencies could only be successfully dealt with by striking at their sources of support and neutralizing them. The objective of such attacks would be psychological rather than purely military. They would be designed to alter the aggressor's calculation of interests in supporting the insurgency through the fear of        further military and economic damage, the fear of involvement in a wider conflict, the fear of internal political upheaval and the fear of greater dependence on a major communist power. Any incidental improvement in morale in the country troubled by insurgency or improvement in bargaining leverage were to be regarded as bonuses. To achieve the desired effect, a care-fully orchestrated series of escalating military measures, coupled with simultaneous political, economic and psychological pressures was called for. The "thesis" was articulated in general terms, but the immediate case in everyone's mind was, of course, Southeast Asia. A thorough critique of Rostov's paper was prepared in OSDISA with inputs from State's Policy Planning Council. This analysis argued that the validity of the "thesis" would depend on two variables (1) the extent of tile commitment of the nation supporting the insurgency; and (2) the degree to which vital U.S. interests were at stake in the conflict. The latter question having been settled with respect to South Vietnam by NSAM 288, the remaining problem was whether the kinds of actions Rostov recommended could succeed given the level of determined commitment of the North Vietnamese. For the Rostov approach to succeed, the DRV would have to be persuaded that (1) the U.S. was taking limited action to achieve limited goals; (2) the U.S. commitment was total; and (3) the U.S. had estab-lished a sufficient domestic consensus to see the policy through. If the DRV was not so convinced, the approach would fail unless there were a major U.S. military involvement in the war. The critique concluded that the public opinion problems of such-an approach, both domestic and international, would be very great, and that in view of the inherent problems of imple-menting and managing such a. discriminating policy, it had poor chances of success. These reservations notwithstanding, the outlook embodied in the "Rostow thesis" came to dominate a good deal of Administration thinking on the question of pressures against the North in the months ahead. All of the pressures-against-the-North thinking came to a head in the strategy meeting of the principals on September 7th. It appears that a rather narrow range of proposals was up for consideration. One program proposal came from the JCS. It was a repeat of the 94-target list program which the JCS had recommended on August 26th. The JCS called for deliberate attempts to provoke the DRV into taking acts which could then be answered by a systematic U.S. air campaign. The JCS argued that such actions were now "essential to preventing complete collapse of the U.S. position in the RVN and SEA," because "continuation of present or foreseeable programs limited to the RVN will not produce the desired result." The Chiefs were supported by ISA in their provocation approach. For ISA, ASD McNaughton argued that our .acts and the DRV response "should be likely to provide good grounds fo?' us to escalate if we wished." McNaughtons approach was for a "gradual squeeze," not simply a tit-for-tat contingency and unlike the quick, all-out proposals of the JCS. The principal conferees at this September meeting did not believe that deliberate acts of provocation should be undertaken "in the immediate future while the GVN is still struggling to its feet." However, they apparently reached a consensus that they might recommend such actions "depending on GVN progress and communist reaction in the meantime" by early October. iv       7  This deferral decision was strongly supported by Mr. McCone of the CIA and Ambassador Taylor. Ambassador Taylor, revising his previous position, believed that the conflict should not be escalated to a level beyond South Vietnamese capacities to manage it. He opposed overt actions against North Vietnam as too risky and urged instead that further measures to strengthen the GVN be taken first. Similarly, Secretary McNamara affirmed his understanding that "we are not acting more strongly because there is a clear hope of strengthening the GVN." McNamara went on to urge, however, that the way be kept open for stronger actions even if the GVN did not improve or in the event the war were widened by the communists. In notes taken at this meeting the President asked "Can we really strengthen the GVN?" It is important to differentiate the consensus of the principals at this September meeting from the views which they had urged on the President in the preceding spring. In the spring the use of force had been clearly contingent upon a major reversal -- principally in Laos -- and had been advanced with the apparent assumption that military actions hopefully would not be required. Now, however, their views were advanced with a sense that such actions were inevitable. The results of the September meeting were recorded in NSAM 314. The actions that were approved against the DRV for the next three month period were highly limited and marginal in character. They included resumption of the off-shore U.S. naval patrols, resumption of covert GVN coastal opera-tions against the North, limited air and ground operations in the Laotian corridor, and a preparedness to respond to any further DRV attacks on a tit-for-tat basis. From the September meeting forward, there was little basic disagreement among the principals on the need for military actions against the North, what prevented action for the time being was a set of tactical considerations. The President was in the midst of an election campaign in which he was presenting himself as the candidate of reason and restraint as opposed to the quixotic Barry Goldwater. Other concerns were the aforementioned shaki-ness of the GVN, the uncertainty as to China's response to an escalation, the desire not to upset the delicate Laotian equation, the need to design whatever actions were taken so as to achieve the maximum public and Con-gressional support, and the implicit belief that overt actions at this time might bring pressure for premature negotiations--that is, negotiations before the DRV was hurting. In summary, the period saw the development of the consensus on military pressures against the North and the decision to defer them for temporary reasons of tactics.

They had been suspended since March. The night before the USS MADDOX is to resume her patrols off the North Vietnamese coast, South Vietnamese commandos raid two North Vietnamese islands. After a six month suspension, the USS MADDOX resumed the DESOTO patrols off the coast of North Vietnam. Acting on Souvanna Phoumas request, the British government urged the ICC members to arrange a meeting among the three Laotian political factions as represented by the three rival princes. The Chinese Communists urged the USSR not to carry out its threat to abandon its co-chairman role in the Geneva settlements, apparently viewing such a development as jeo-. pardizing the possibilities of a Geneva settlement of the current Laotian crisis. Apparently mistaking the MADDOX for South Vietnamese, three DRV patrol, boats launched a torpedo and machine gun attack on her. Responding immediately to the attack, and with the help of air support from the nearby carrier TICONDEROGA, the MADDOX destroyed  .      DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION one of the attacking boats and damaged the other two. The MADDOX, under 7th Fleet orders, retired to South Vietnamese waters where she is joined by the C. TURNER JOY. 3 Aug 1964 U.S. protest through ICC A. stiff U.S. protest of the attack on the MADDOX is dispatched to Hanoi through the ICC. It warns that "grave consequences" will result from any future attacks on U.S. forces. DESOTO patrol resumed The JCS approved a CINCPAC request to resume the DESOTO patrol at 1350 hours, ordered the C. TURNER JOY to be added to it and author- ized active defensive measures for the destroyers and their supporting aircraft. The President announced the action later that day. 3 Aug 1964 GVN again attacks North Vietnam The Rhon River estuary and the Vinh Sonh radar installation were bombarded under cover of darkness. 4 Aug 1964 Second DRV naval attack on DESOTO patrol At about 2140 hours, after several hours of shadowing, a second PT boat attack on the augmented DESOTO task force was launched. This engagement in the dark lasted about three hours and resulted in two patrol boats destroyed. Reprisal alerts At 0030 hours (5 Aug 1964 Vietnam time), "alert orders" for possible reprisal air strikes were given to the TICONDEROGA and a second carrier, the CONSTELLATION, that had been steaming toward the area from Hong Kong since Aug 3. NSC meeting At 1230, Washington time, the NSC convened after a brief meeting of the JCS with the President. The JCS, McNamara and others recommended reprisals against the patrol craft and their bases. This the President approved. 2  .     f   DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION 2nd NSC meeting After a confusing afternoon in which the attacks were double-checked and verified, the NSC met again at 1700, confirmed the reprisal order, and discussed incremental force deployments to the western Pacific. Congressional briefing At 1845 the President met with 16 Congressional leaders, briefed them on the proposed attacks and informed them of his intention to ask for a joint Congressional resolution of support. None raised objections. 5 Aug 1964 U Thant calls for 14-nation conference on Laos In an unrelated development, UN Secretary General U Thant called for the rescheduling of the l4-nation conference to deal with the Laotian situation. Presidential message to Congress In a formal message to both houses of Congress, the President requested passage of a joint resolution of support for U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. Concurrently, identical draft resolutions prepared by the executive branch were introduced in the Senate by Senator Fulbright, and in the House, by Representative Morgan. 6 Aug 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolutions discussed in committee Both houses heard top Administration officials, including Secretary McNamara, testify in behalf of the pending resolutions. Force deployments The additional forces deploy-ments, particularly air forces, begin to move to the theatre. 7 Aug 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution passes Congress The Tonkin Gulf resolution was passed in both houses by near unanimous vote. 3 .  .

Concern over not provoking a communist military escalation in Laos, particularly in view of the Tonkin Gulf reprisals, prompted State to defer tempo-rar ily approval of air and ground initiatives in the Laotian panhandle. Taylor opposes a l4-nation Geneva Conference as likely to undermine the little stability the fragile GVN still has. He further states that the reprisals, while effective in the short run, do not deal with the continuing problem of DRV infiltration which must be confronted. He felt there was need for follow-up action to demonstrate to the DRV that the rules of the game had changed. Through the Canadian representative on the ICC, the U.S. communicated its uncertainty about DRV motives in the Aug 4 Tonkin Gulf raids, that additional air power deployed to SEA was precautionary, that U.S. official and public patience was wearing thin, that the Congressional resolution demonstrated U.S. determination in SEA, and that if the DRV pursued its present course, it could expect to suffer the consequences. Assistant Secretary of State Bundy felt that only a continuous combination of military pressure and communication  I     By NWD Date 201 I  DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION would convince Hanoi that they were facing a determined foe and that they should get out of South Vietnam and Laos. 14 Aug 1964 CJCS memo to SecDef, "Next Courses of Action in Southeast Asia" Positive assessment of the impact of the reprisal actions was given and a continuation of strikes against the North was recommended. 15 Aug 1964 16 Aug 1964 17 Aug 1964 State message 439 to Vientiane, Saigon, CINCPAC, "Southeast Asia, August 1964" JCS message 7947 to CINCPAC, "Rules of Engagement" COMUSMACV message to CINCPAC, "CrossBorder Operations" CINCPAC message to JCS, "Next Courses of Action in Southeast Asia" In opposing both a new 14-nation Geneva Conference on Southeast Asia, and U.S. air operations against the North, State stressed the shakiness of the GVN and the need to shore it up internally before any such actions were started. For planning purposes, the message suggested that Ambassador Taylors suggested date of January 1, 1965, be used for any sustained U.S. air campaign against the North. U.S. forces were authorized to attack any vessels or aircraft that attack or give positive indication of intent to attack, and to pursue such attackers into territorial waters or air space of all Southeast Asian countries, including North Vietnam. MACV requested authority to begin the Phase I of the covert cross-border operations into Laos and North Vietnam. The positive impact of the reprisals on South Vietnamese morale is noted, and a strong argument made for continuing actions against the North to make clear to Hanoi and Peking the cost of their aggression. 5  .     n  DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION The momentum of the Aug 5 raids must not be lost or the benefits of the initial attacks will disappear. k8 Aug 1964 Embassy Saigon message 465 Taylor reiterates his belief that the reprisals must be followed up with other actions against the North. 21 Aug 1964 Henry Rowen memo to JCS, et Bl "The Rostow Thesis" Initially presented in Dec 1963, the "Rostow Thesis" was recirculated within the Administration in mid-August. Its fundamental argument was that military pressure against the external sources of an insurgency would bring the aggressor to an appreciation of the costs of his interference and he would reduce or eliminate his support for the insurgents. The exercise was primarily psychological, not necessarily strategic. The measures should greatly increase his uncertainty about the consequences of continued support of the insurgency. Rowen's critique raised serious questions about the general validity of the thesis, point-ing out the requirement for solid public and political support for such actions, and doubting that anywhere but in Southeast Asia U.S. interests were so critically at stake. Even in that area, it doubted the effectiveness of the proposal. 26 Aug 1964 JCSM-746-64 In response to State's Aug 14 analysis, the JCS. proposed a continuous and escalating air campaign against the North designed to both the physical resources and the psychological will to support the insurgency in the South. It called for , 6  .

Khanh reverts to Premiership His bid for dictatorial power having been rebuffed by the Army with popular support, Khanh reverted to his former tital of Premier with greatly reduced power. Minh is to play a larger role. 7 Sep 1964 JCS Talking Paper for CJCS, "Next Courses of Action for RVN" The JCS repeated its recommendations of 26 Aug and detailed it with a list of 94 targets for air strikes. white House strategy meeting; decisions in william Bundy memo to SecDef, et al, "Courses of Action for South Vietnam," 8 Sep 1964 with Ambassador Taylor returned from Saigon, a full dress strategy review of actions against the North is held at the white House.

This was the view of CIA, State and the white House. But a decision was made to resume the DESOTO patrols, the covert GVN coastal operations against the North, and to authorize limited crossborder operations into Laos when Souvanna approved. It was further agreed that we would respond to any future DRV attacks on U.S. units on a tit-for-tat basis. These latter measures were to bolster GVN morale. Formal approval of the 7 September decision was given in NSAM 314. At a Saigon meeting of representatives of the U.S. missions in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, it vzas agreed that the air operations in Southern Laos would be carried out by RIAF aircraft for the present. As to ground operations, while their desirability was recognized, they were disapproved because of the flagrant violation of the Geneva Accords they would constitute. This objection by Vientiane vzas subsequently removed and company-size opera-tions up to 20 kilometers into Laos were approved. The destroyers USS MORTON and USS EDWARDS resumed the DESOTO patrols off North Vietnam. On the night of the 18th, the third incident in the DESOTO patrols occurred.

The deterioration of GVN morale and effectiveness continued unabated and this intelligence estimate did not think that the hoped for civilian government would be able to reverse it. The VC were not, however, expected to make an overt military effort to capture the government. " The President authorized reactivation of the covert coastal strikes by the GVN against the DRV, under very tight controls with each action to be cleared in advance by OSD, State and the white House. The Embassy is authorized to urge the Laotian Government to begin T-28 strikes as soon as possible against a 22-target list which excluded the Mu Gia pass. Some of the targets were designed for U.S. YANKEE TEAM strikes.  .

China was not expected to enter the war as a result of even a systematic U.S. air campaign against the North. Taylor reported that the ARVN would be unable to conduct ground operations in the Laotian corridor in the foreseeable future and therefore U.S. air operations are urged. At a minimum, combat air patrols supporting RIAF strike missions were requested. U.S. air strikes against four defended targets are requested to accompany RLAF T-28 strikes in the northern panhandle. Washington, responding to Ungers request, authorized only U.S. combat air patrols in support of the RLAF operations, not the U.S. strikes. U.S. air strikes against communist LOCs in the panhandle are not authorized until much later. The RLAF, with U.S. aircraft in combat air patrol support, make the first strikes against the communist LOCs in the pan-handle . 10       Sens it iv I PROLOGUE ACTIONS AND PROGRAMS UNDERWAY Several forms of pressure were already being applied against North Vietnam by July of 1964. Moreover, contingency plans for other forms -- should political and military circumstances warrant a' decision to use them were continually being adjusted and modi-fied as the situation in Southeast Asia developed. The best known of these pressures was being applied in Laos. Since 21 May, U.S. aircraft had flown low-level reconnaissance missions over communist-occupied areas. 1 In early June Premier Souvanna Phouma both gave and reaffirmed his permission for armed escort of these missions, which included the right to retaliate against hostile fire from the ground. 2 This effort was supplemented at the end of the month when the United States decided to conduct transport and night reconnaissance operations and furnish additional T-28 aircraft and munitions to support a Royal Laotian counteroffensive near Muong Soui. This decision came in response to Souvanna's request, in which he equated the protection of Muong Soui with the survival of the Laotian neutralist army. 3 Air strikes conducted by the Royal. Lao Air Force, with T-28s obtained from the United States, were later credited with playing a major role in the success of the RLG's operations. Other actions obviously designed to forestall communist aggressive intentions were taken in different parts of Southeast Asia. In June, following the Honolulu strategy conference, State and Defense Depart-ment sources made repeated leaks to the press affirming U.S. intentions to support its allies and uphold its treaty commitments in Southeast Asia. 4 U.S. contingency ground-force stockages in Thailand were augmented and publicly acknowledged. 5 Revelations were made that USAF aircraft were operating out of a newly constructed air base at Da Nang. Moreover, the base was characterized as part of a network of new air bases and operational facilities being developed in South Vietnam and Thailand. 6 On 10 July, the Da Nang base was the site of a well-publicized Air Force Day display of allied airpower, including aircraft from a B-57 wing recently acknowledged to have been permanently deployed to the Philippines from Japan. 7 Less known were para!1et actions taken within the Government. U.S. resolve to resist aggression in Southeast Asia was communicated directly to North Vietnam by the newly appointed Canadian member of the International Control Commission, Blair Seaborn. Stressing that U.S. ambitions were limited and its intentions were "essentially peace-ful, " Seaborn told Pham Van Dong that the patience of the U.S. Govern-ment was not limitless. He explained that the United States was fully aware of the degreee to which Hanoi controlled the Viet  .      Cong insurgency and the Pathet Ino and might be obliged to carry the war to the North if DRV-assisted pressures against South Vietnam continued. He further cautioned that U.S. stakes in resisting a North Vietnamese victory were high, since the United States saw the conflict in Southeast Asia as part of a geneal confrontation with guerrilla subversion in other parts of the world, and that "in the event of escalation the greatest devastation would of course result for the DRVN itself." 8 Also underway were efforts directed toward educating the American public regarding our national interests in Southeast Asia and the extent of the U.S. commitment there. In reporting to the President, Administration officials who participated in the Honolulu Conference stressed the need for a domestic information effort to "get at the basic doubts" of the importance of the U.S. stake in Southeast Asia. The program was to be focused both on key members of the Congress and on the public. 9 Thereafter, work was begun under State Department guidance to assemble information in answer to some of the prevalent public questions on the U.S. involvement. Of special concern was a recent Gallup poll showing only 37 percent of the public to have some interest in our Southeast Asian policies. Administration officials viewed this group as consisting primarily of either those desiring our withdrawal or those urging our striking at North Vietnam. A general program was proposed with the avowed aims of eroding public support for these polar positions and solidifying a large "center" behind the thrust of current Administration policies. These aims were to be accomplished by directing public comment into discussions of the precise alternatives available to the United States, greater exposure to which it was believed would alienate both "hawk" and "dove" supporters. 10 Less than a week after this proposal was submitted, the White House published a NSAM, naming its proponent, Robert Manning, as coordinator of all public information activities for Southeast Asia and directing all agencies to cooperate in furthering the Administration's information objectives. 11 One of the principal foci of the subsequent information program was the compilation of a public pamphlet of questions raised by critics of Administration policy together with answers furnished and coordinated by several interested Government agencies. Unknown to more than a limited number of Government officials were a variety of covert military or quasi-military operations being con-ducted at the expense of North Vietnam. U.S. naval forces had undertaken intermittent patrol operations in the Gulf of Tonkin designed to acquire visual, electronic and photographic intelligence on infiltration activi-ties and coastal navigation from North Vietnam to the South. To carry out these missions, destroyers were assigned to tracks between fixed points and according to stipulated schedules. Designated DE SOTO Patrols, the first such operation of 1964 occurred during the period 28 February-10 March. On this patrol the U.S.S. Craig was authorized to approach to within 4 n.m. of the North Vietnamese mainland, 15 n.m. of the Chinese mainland and 12 n.m. of Chinese-held islands. No incidents were reported S -nsitive .     Tv-  as resulting from this action. The next DE SOTO Patrol did not occur until 31 July, on which the U.S.S. Maddox was restricted to a track not closer than 8 n.m. off the North Vietnamese mainland. 12 Its primary mission, assigned on 17 July, was "to determine DRV coastal activity along the full extent of the patrol track." Other specific intelligence requirements were assigned as follows "(a) location and identification of all radar transmitters, and estimate of range capabilities; (b) navigational and hydro information along the routes traversed and particular naviga-tlonal lights characteristics, landmarks, buoys, currents and tidal information, river mouths and channel accessibility, (c) monitoring a junk force with density of surface traffic pattern, (d) sampling electronic environment radars and navigation aids, (e) photography of opportunities in support of above" Separate coastal patrol operations were being conducted by South Vietnamese naval forces. These were designed to uncover and interdict efforts to smuggle personnel and supplies into the South in support of the VC insurgency. This operation had first been organized with U.S. assistance in December 1961; to support it a fleet of motorized junks was built partially financed with U.S. military assistance funds. During 1964 these vessels operated almost continually in attempts to intercept communist seaborne logistical operations. As Secretary McNamara told Senate committees "In the first seven months of this year 19647, they have searched 149,000 junks, some 570,000 people. This is a tremendous operation endeavoring to close the seacoasts of over 900 miles. In the process of that actien, as the junk patrol has increased in strength they sic have moved farther and farther north endeavoring to find the source of the infiltration." 14 In addition to these acknowledged activities, the GVN was also conducting a number of operations against North Vietnam to which it did not publicly admit. Covert operations were carried out by South Vietnamese or hired personnel and supported by U.S. training and logistical efforts. Outlined within OPLAN 34 A, these operations had been underway theoretically since February but had experienced what the JCS called a "slow beginning." Despite an ultimate objective of helping convince the North Vietnamese leadership that it is in its own selfinterest to desist from its aggressive policies," few operations designed to harass the enemy were carried out successfully during the February-May period. Nevertheless, citing DRV reactions tending "to substantiate the premise that Hanoi is expending substantial resources in defensive measures, the JCS concluded that the potential of the OPLAN 34A program remained high and urged its continuation through Phase II (June-September). 15 Operations including air-infiltration of sabotage teams, underwaterdemo-lition, and seizures of communist junks were approved for the period, and a few were carried by specially trained GVN forces during June and July. 16 . 3  .      In the process of combined GVN-U.S. planning, but not yet approved for execution, were cross-border operations against VC-North Vietnamese logistical routes in Laos. This planning provided for both air attacks by the VNAF and "ground operations up to battalion size" in the Laotian Panhandle. Preparations for such actions had been approved in principle since March but since then little further interest had been shown in them. Toward the end of July, the air force portion was examined seriously by Administration officials as a means not only to damage the Communist logistical effort but also "primarily for reasons of morale in South Vietnam and to divert GVN attention from a proposal to strike North Vietnam." 17 In addition to both the open and covert operations already under-way, a number of other actions intended to bring pressure against North Vietnam had been recommended to the white House. Receiving considerable attention among Administration officials during May and June was a pro-posed request for a Congressional Resolution, reaffirming support by the legislators for Presidential action to resist Communist advances in Southeast Asia during an election year Tab A. In some respects paral-leling this domestic initiative, the President was urged to present to the United Nations the detailed case assembled by the Government supporting the charges of DRV aggression against South Vietnam and Laos, He was also urged to authorize periodic deployments of additional forces toward Southeast Asia as a means of demonstrating U.S. resolve to undertake whatever measures were required to resist aggression in that region. Moreover, in OPLAN 37-64-, there was fully developed a listing of forces to be deployed as a deterrent to communist escalation in reaction to U.S.GVN actions against North Vietnam. Finally, it was recommended that the President make the decision to use "selected and carefully graduated mili-tary force against North Vietnam" if necessary to improve non-Communist prospects in South Vietnam and Laos. 18 The source documents available to this writer are not clear on the exact decisions made in response to each of these recommendations, or indeed on the precise form or context in which the recommendations were presented. It is evident that the proposal to seek a Congressional Resolution was not favorably received, but as subsequent events indicate neither was it rejected out-of-hand. It proved very useful in largely the same language just two months later. Less certain are the decisions made about the other proposals. Certainly they were not approved for immedi-ate implementation. However, it is not clear whether they were (1) flatly disapproved, (2) merely postponed, or (3) approved in principle, subject to gradual implementation. At the Honolulu Conference, where many of the proposed actions were discussed with U.S. officials from the theatre, many practical considerations were aired which showed that delayed implementa-tion would be a reasonable course of action. 19 But such factors would have provided equally valid reasons for either deciding against the pro-posals or for merely deferring a decision until a later, more appropriate time. The most significant point, for an understanding of the events and decisions of the second half of 19611, is that these options remained "on the shelf'1 for possible implementation should favorable circumstances arise.        II THE TONKIN GULF CRISIS Several oe the pressuring measures recommended to the white House in May or June were implemented in conjunction with or in the immedia  aftermath of naval action in the Tonkin Gulf. It is this ac an v e ' rapidity with which these measures were taken that has led critics to . doubt some aspects of the public account of the Tonkin inci en s. 1 ls also this fact, together with later Administration assessments o ne Tonkin Gulf experience, that give the incidents greater significance than the particular events seemed at first to warrant. THE FIRST INCIDENT What happened in the Gulf? As noted earlier, U.S.S. MADDOX com-menced the second DE SOTO Patrol on 31 July. On the prior nigh South Vietnamese coastal patrol forces made a midnight attack, inc u ing n amphibious "commando" raid, on Hon Me and Hon Nieu Islands, a ouc 9 R latitude. At the time of this attack, U.S.S. MADDOX was 1j mi es away just heading into waters off North Vietnam. On 2 August, aving reached the northernmost point on its patrol track and having ea e South, the destroyer was intercepted by three North Vietnamese pa ro boats. Apparently, these boats and a fleet of junke. had move in o  e area near the island to search for the attacking force and had mlseaten Maddox for a South Vietnamese escort vessel. (Approximate y eevcn earlier, while on a northerly heading, Maddox had altered cours< o avoi the junk concentration shown on her radar; about six hours a er j now headed South Maddox had altered her course to the southeast to avoid the junks a second time.) when the FT boats began tnell lgl spee run at her, at a distance of approximately 10 miles, the aeo royer v,as 28 miles from the coast and heading farther into international waters. Two of the boats closed to within 5,000 yards, launcnrng one orpe.no. eac i. As they approached, Maddox fired on the boats with her 5-inc a celles and altered course to avoid the torpedoes, which were observea passing the starboard side at a distance of 100 to 200 yards. The thir oa moved up abeam of the destroyer and took a direct 5-incn hi , n manage to launch a torpedo which failed to run. All three PT boats ire 5 caliber machine guns at Maddox as they made their firing run.., an e fragment was recovered from the destroyer's superstructure. 1 e a ac s occurred in mid-afternoon, and photographs were taken c. the torpe o oa s as they attacked. 20 Upon first report of the PT boats' apparently .hostile intent, four F-8E aircraft were launched from the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga, many miles to the South, with instructions to provide air cover but no o fire unless they or Maddox were fired upon. As Maddox continued in a southerly direction, Ticonderogas aircraft attacked the two boats a had initiated the action. Both were damaged with Zuni rockets and mm gunfire. The third boat, struck by the destroyer's 5-inch, was already        dead in the water. After about eight minutes, the aircraft broke off their attacks. In the meantime, Maddox had been directed by the 7th Fleet Commander to retire from the area to avoid hostile fire. Following their attacks on the PT's, the aircraft joined Maddox and escorted her back toward South Vietnamese waters where she joined a second destroyer, C. Turner Joy. The two ships continued to patrol in international waters. Approximately two hours after the action, in early evening, reconnaissance aircraft from Ticonderoga located the damaged PT's and obtained two photo-graphs. The third boat was last seen burning and presumed sunk. 21 On 3 August a note of protest was dispatched to the Hanoi Government, reportedly through the International Control Commission for Indo-China. Directed by the President, the note stressed the unprovoked nature of the North Vietnamese attack and closed with the following warning "The U.S. Government expects that the authorities of the regime in North Vietnam will be under no misapprehension as to the grave consequences which would inevitably result from any further unprovoked offensive military action against U.S. forces." On that same day, measures were taken to increase the security of the DE SOTO Patrol, the approved schedule of which still had two days to run. At 1325 hours (Washington time) the JCS approved a CINCPAC request to resume the patrol at a distance of 11 n.m. from the North Vietnamese coast. 22 Later in the day, President Johnson announced that he had approved .doubling the patrolling force and authorized active defensive measures on the part of both the destroyers and their escorting aircraft. His press statement included the following I have instructed the Navy 1. To continue the patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of North Vietnam. 2. To double the force by adding an additional destroyer to the one already on patrol. 3 To provide a combat air patrol over the destroyers, and 4. To issue orders to the commanders of the combat aircraft and the two destroyers; (a) to attack any force which attacks them in international waters, and (b) to attack with the objective not only of driving off the force but of destroying it. 23 THE SECOND INCIDENT Late the following evening the destroyers, Maddox and C. Turner Joy, were involved in a second encounter with hostile patrol boats. Like the first incident, this occurred following a South Vietnamese attack on North  .      Vietnamese coastal targets this time the Rhon River estuary and the Vinh Sonh radar installation, which were bombarded on the night of 3 August. The more controversial of the two, this incident occurred under cover of darkness and seems to have been both triggered and des-cribed largely by radar and sonar images. After the action had been joined, however, both visual sightings and intercepted North Vietnamese communications confirmed that an attack by hostile patrol craft was in progress. 24 At 1940 hours, 4 August 1964 (Tonkin Gulf time), while "proceeding S.E. at best speed,11 Task Group 72.1 (Maddox and Turner Joy) radioed "RCVD INFO indicating attack by PGM P-4 imminent.1' Evidently this was based on an intercepted communication, later identified as "an intelli-gence source, " indicating that "North Vietnamese naval forces had been ordered to attack the patrol." At the time, radar contacts evaluated as "probable torpedo boats" were observed about 36 miles to the northeast. Accordingly, the Task Group Commander altered course and increased speed to avoid what he evaluated as a trap. At approximately 2035 hours, while west of Hainan Island, the destroyers reported radar sightings of three unidentified aircraft and two unidentified vessels in the patrol area. On receiving the report, Ticonderoga immediately launched F-8s and A-4Ds to provide a combat air patrol over the destroyers, within minutes, the unidentified aircraft disappeared from the radar screen, while the vessels maintained a distance of about 27 miles. Actually, surface contacts on a parallel course had been shadowing the destroyers with radar for more than three hours. ECM contacts maintained by the C. Turner Joy indicated that the radar was that carried aboard DRV patrol boats. 25  New unidentified surface contacts 13 miles distant were reported at 2134 hours. These vessels were closing at approximately 30 knots on the beam and were evaluated as "hostile". Six minutes later (2140) Maddox opened fire, and at 1242, by which time two of the new contacts had closed to a distance of 11 miles, aircraft from Ticonderoga's CAP began their attacks. Just before this, one of the PT boats launched a torpedo, which was later reported as seen passing about 300 feet off the port beam, from aft to forward, of the C. Turner Joy. A searchlight beam was observed to swing in an arc toward the C. Turner Joy by all of the destroyer's signal bridge personnel. It was extinguished before it illuminated the ship, presumably upon detection of the approaching aircraft. Aboard the Maddox, Marine gunners saw what were believed to be cockpit lights of one or more small boats pass up the port side of the ship and down the other. After approximately an hour's action, the destroyers reported two enemy boats sunk and no damage or casualties suffered. 26 In the meantime, two patrol craft from the initial surface contact had closed to join the action, and the engagement was described for higher headquarters largely on the basis of the destroyers 1 radar and sonar indications and on radio intercept information. In successive messages to CINCPACFLT, beginning about 2150 hours, the Commander of Task Group 72.1 radioed that he was "under continuous torpedo attack" that at least six and later ten torpedoes had been successfully evaded. Eventually,  .      the count reached 22 torpedoes, a total which caused the Commanding Officer, once the engagement had ended, to question the validity 01 his report and communicate these doubts to his superiors. "Review of action makes many recorded contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effectsan overeager sonarman may have accounted for many reports. In addition to sonar readings, however, the Task Group had also reported intercepting communications from North Vietnamese nal CV r a, that they were involved in an attack on U.S. ( enemy ) s ips an a they had "sacrificed" two vessels in the engagement. 27 THE RESPONSE IN WASHINGT0N Sometime prior to the reported termination of the engagement, at 0030 hours, 5 August (Tonkin Gulf time), "alert orders to spare for possible reprisal raids were sent out by naval authori leo ,----------- and to a second aircraft carrier, Constellat-on, whrcn s ar e ea . g South from Hong Kong late on 3 August. Such raids were ac u- y o ' eu and carried out later in the day. "Defense officials lsc ose  testimony, 9 January 1968 that, when the first word was recerveo. second attack immediate consideration was given to idoicn. , a apparently began shortly after 0920 hours (Washington ime),w . task group message that a North Vietnamese naval attac was lmmmen first relayed to Washington. From this time on, amw a sequence  sages describing the attack, Secretary McNamara hel a with his chief civilian and military advisers concerning ee -g 6 ment and possible U.S. retaliatory actions. As he besvi ie -1 Fulbright Committee "we identified and refined various options for a response to the attack, to be presented to the President. Among ,ese $ . , -was the air strike against the attacking boats an err as bases, which option was eventually selected. As eop identified preliminary messages were sent toappropraa  a commanders alerting them to the several possiba-li ies so a planning steps could be undertaken." 28 At 1230, the President met with the National Security Council. Having just come from a brief meeting with the JCS, a -uenaJ  Secretary Rusk and McGeorge Bundy, Secretary McNamara rie e e on the reported details of the attack and the posslbilitiesior reprisal. Shortly thereafter (presumably during a working luncn '1en9 Secretary Rusk and Bundy) and after receiving by telephone the adyrce 01 the JCS, McNamara and the others recommended specific reprisal actions. It was at this point that the President approved a response consisting of an air strike on the PT and SWATOW boat bases and therr associa e facilities." 29  .      Returning from this session shortly after 1500, Secretary McNamara, along with Deputy Secretary Vance, joined with the JCS to review all the evidence relating to the engagement. Included in this review was the communications intelligence information which the Secretary reported, containing North Vietnamese reports that (1) their vessels were engaging the destroyers, and (2) they had lost two craft in the fight. In the meantime, however, messages had been relayed to the Joint Staff indicating considerable confusion over the details of the attack. The DE SOTO Patrol Commanders message, expressing doubts about earlier evidence of a large-scale torpedo attack, arrived sometime after 1330 hours. Considerably later (it was not sent to CINCPACFLT until 1447 EDT), another message arrived to the effect that while details of the action were still confusing, the commander of Task Group 72.1 was certain that the ambush was genuine. He had interviewed the personnel who sighted the boats cockpit lights passing near the Maddox, and he had obtained a report from the C. Turner Joy that two torpedoes were observed passing nearby. Accordingly, these reports were discussed by telephone with CINCPAC, and he was instructed by Secretary McNamara to make a careful check of the evidence and ascertain whether there was any doubt concerning the occurrence of an attack. CINCPAC called the JCS at least twice more, at 1723 and again at 1807 hours, to state that he was convinced on the basis of "additional information" that the attacks had taken place. 30 At the time of the earlier call Secretary McNamara and the JCS were discussing possible force deployments to follow any reprisals. On the occasion of the first call, the Secretary was at the white House attending the day's second NSC meeting. Upon being informed of CINCPACs call, he reports "I spoke to the Director of the Joint Staff and asked him to make certain that the Commander in Chief, Pacific was willing to state that the attack had taken place, and therefore that he was free to release the Executive Order because earlier in the afternoon I had told him that under no circumstances would retali-atory action take place until we were, to use my words, 'damned sure that the attacks had taken place.'" 31 At the meeting of the National Security Council, proposals to deploy certain increments of OPLAN 37-64 forces to the western Pacific were dis-cussed, and the order to retaliate against North Vietnamese patrol craft and their associated facilities was confirmed. Following this meeting, at 1845, the President met with 16 Congressional leaders from both parties for a period of 89 minutes. Reportedly, he described the second incident in the Gulf, explained his decisions to order reprisals, and informed the legislators of his intention to request a formal statement of Congressional support for these decisions. On the morning following the meeting, The Washington Post carried a report that none of the Congressional leaders present at the meeting had raised objections to the course of action planned. Their only question, the report stated, "had to do with how Congress could show its agreement and concern in the crisis." 32  .      lh many ways the attacks on U.S. ships in the Tonkin Gulf provided the Administration with an opportunity to do a number of things that had been urged on it. Certainly it offered a politically acceptable way of exerting direct punitive pressure on North Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the U.S. response served to satisfy for a time the growing desire for some action to carry the war to the North. Relative to the election campaign, it provided a means of eliminating any doubts about President Johnson's decisiveness that may have been encouraged by his preferred candidates image as the restrained man of peace. The obvious convenience and the ways in which it was exploited have been at the root of much of the suspicion with which critics of Administration policy have viewed the incident. The documents available to this writer are not conclusive on this point, but the evidence indicates that the occurrence of a DRV provocation at this time resulted from events over which the U.S. Government exercised little control. It has been suggested that the incidents were related in some way to pressure coming from the GVN for U.S, action against North Vietnam. However, the patrol was authorized on or prior to 17 July, and General Khanhs oft-cited "Go North" appeal wasn't made until 19 July. The first attack almost certainly was a case of mistaken judgment on the part of the local Vietnamese commander. His probable association of U.S.S. Maddox with the South Vietnamese raiding force is indicated by the circum-stances preceding the event, the brief duration and character of it, and the long-delayed (not until 5 August) and rather subdued DRV public com-ment. Moreover, there is little reason to see anything more than coinci-dence in the close conjunction between the GVNs maritime operations against the North Vietnamese coast and the scheduling of the DE SOTO Patrol. The two operations were scheduled and monitored from different authorities and through separate channels of communication and command. Higher U.S. naval commands were infolmed of the operations against the two islands by COMUSMACV, but the task group commander had no knowledge of where or when the specific operations had taken place. As Secretary McNamara told Senator Morse, in response to charges that U.S. naval forces were supporting the GVN operation, "Our ships had absolutely no knowledge of it, were not connected with it; in no sense of the word can be considered to have backstopped the effort." In addition, there was no reason on the basis of earlier DE SOTO Patrol experience to even suspect that patrol activity might precipitate hostile action by North Vietnam. 33 Although the events of the second attack were less clear-cut, the evidence does not support beliefs (which have been expressed) that the incident was staged. On the contrary, the evidence leads readily to other explanations, which are at least equally as plausible. DRV motivations for the second attack are unclear, but several possibilities provide rational explanations for a deliberate DRV decision. Those given credence at the time -- that the DRV or China wanted to . 1      By NWD Date 201 1  increase pressures for an international conference or that the DRV was testing U.S. reactions to a contemplated general offensive 34 -have lost some credibility. Subsequent events and DRV actions have appeared to lack any consistent relationship with such motives. Perhaps closer to the mark is the narrow purpose of prompt retaliation for an embarrassing and well-publicized rebuff by a much-maligned enemy. Inexperienced in modern naval operations, DRV leaders may have believed that under cover of darkness it would be possible to even the score or to provide at least a psychological victory by severely damaging a U.S. ship. Unlike the first incident, the DRV was ready (5 August) with a propaganda blast denying its own provocation and claiming the destruction of U.S. aircraft. Still, regardless of motive, there is little question but that the attack on the destroyers was deliberate. Having followed the destroyers for hours, their course was well known to the North Vietnamese naval force, and its advance units were laying ahead to make an ambushing beam attack fully 60 miles from shore. The reality of a North Vietnamese attack on 4 August has been corroborated by both visual and technical evidence. That it may have been deliberately provoked by the United States is belied to a considerable degree by circumstantial evidence. Operating restrictions for the DE SOTO Patrol were made more stringent following the first attack. The 11 n.m., rather than 8 n.m., off-shore patrolling track indicates an intention to avoid -- not provoke further contact. On 4 February the rules of engagement were modified to restrict "hot pursuit" by the U.S. ships to no closer than 11 n.m. from the North Vietnamese coast; aircraft were to pursue no closer than 3 n.m. 35 Given the first attack, the Presidents augmentation of the patrol force was a normal precaution, particularly since both Tj conderoga and C. Turner Joy were already deployed in the immediate vicinity as supporting elements. Moreover, since the augmentation was coupled with a clear statement of intent to continue the patrols and a firm warning to the DRV that repetition would bring dire consequences, their addition to the patrol could be expected to serve more as a deterrent than a provocation. The often alleged "poised" condition of the U.S. reprisal forces was anything but extraordinary. U.S.S. Constellation was well out of the immediate operating area as the patrol was resumed on 3 August. In fact, one reason for delaying the launching of retaliatory air strikes (nearly 1100 hours, 5 August Tonkin Gulf time) was to permit Constellation to approach within reasonable range of the targets. Target lists from which to make appropriate selections were already available as a result of routine contingency planning accomplished in June and July. In preparation for the resumed DE SOTO Patrol of 3-5 August, the patrol track was moved farther north to make clearer the separation between it and the 34-A operations. 36 The ways in which the events of the second Tonkin Gulf incident came about give little indication of a deliberate provocation to provide opportunity for reprisals. BROADENING THE IMPACT There is no question, however, that the second incident was promptly exploited by the Administration.

Thirdly, lighter om er been moved into Thailand. Fourthly, intercep or an rg 12        bomber squadrons have been transferred from the United States into advance bases in the Pacific. Fifthly, an antisubmarine task force group has been moved into the South China Sea. 37 It is significant, relative to the broader purpose of the deploy-ments, that few of these additional units were removed from the Western Pacific when the immediate crisis subsided. In late September the fourth attack aircraft carrier was authorized to resume its normal station in the Eastern Pacific as soon as the regularly assigned carrier completed repairs. The other forces remained in the vicinity of their August deploy-ment. 38 Other actions taken by the Administration in the wake of Tonkin Gulf were intended to communicate to various audiences the depth and sincerity of the U.S. commitment. On the evening of 4 August, in con-junction with his testing of Congressional opinion regarding reprisal action, President Johnson disclosed his intention to request a resolution in support of U.S. Southeast Asian policy. This he did through a formal message to both houses on 5 August. Concurrently, identical draft resolutions, the language of which had been prepared by executive agencies, were introduced in the Senate by J. william Fulbright (D., Ark.) and in the House by Thomas E. Morgan (D., Pa.) and co-sponsored by bi-partisan leadership. 39 Discussed in committee on 6 August, in response to testimony by leading Administration officials, the resolution was passed the following day by votes of 88 to 2 in the Senate and 416 to 6 in the House Tab c Despite the nearly unanimous votes of support for the Resolution, Congressional opinions varied as to the policy implications and the meaning of such support. The central belief seemed to be that the occasion necessitated demonstrating the nation's unity and collective will in support of the President's action and affirming U.S. determination to oppose further aggression. However, beyond that theme, there was a considerable variety of opinion. For example, in the House, expressions of support varied from Congressman Laird's argument, that while the retaliation in the Gulf was appropriate such actions still left a policy to be developed with respect to the land war in Southeast Asia, to the more reticent viewpoint of Congressman Alger. The latter characterized his support as being primarily for purposes of showing unity and expressed concern over the danger of being dragged into war by "other nations seeking our help." Several spokesmen stressed that the Resolution did not constitute a declaration of war, did not abdicate Congressional responsibility for determining national policy commitments, and did not give the President carte blanche to involve the nation in a major Asian war. 4q Similar expressions were voiced in the senior chamber. For example, Senator Nelson sought assurances that the Resolution would not be exploited to commit the United States further in the direction of a large land war 13  .     33  in Asia without an .expression of specific Congressional approval. In response, Senator Fulbright stated that he did not believe that the Resolu-tion changed in any way the Administrations concept of keeping the conflict in Vietnam as limited as possible. He identified the purposes of the Resolution as being only (1) "to make it clear that the Congress approves the action taken by the President to meet the attack on U.S. forces" and (2) to declare support for the resolute policy enunciated by the President in order to prevent further aggression, or to retaliate with suitable measures should such aggression take place." 41 However, in subsequent discussion it was made clear .that preventing or retaliating against further aggression was interpreted rather broadly at the time "(Mr. Cooper) ...are we now giving the President advance authority to take whatever action he may deem necessary res-pecting South Vietnam and its defense, or with respect to the defense of any other country included in the SEATO treaty? "(Mr. Fulbright) I think that is correct. "(Mr. Cooper) Then, looking ahead, if the President decided that it was necessary to use such force as could lead into war, we will give that authority by this resolution? "(Mr. Fulbright) That is the way I would interpret it. If a situation later developed in which we thought the approval should be withdrawn it could be withdrawn by concurrent resolu-tion." 42 The Congressional Resolution had several intended audiences. First, it was aimed at the communist powers who might not believe the President would risk legislative debate over strong military actions in an election year. Second, it was intended to reassure our allies, particularly in Asia, who might doubt the ability of the President to rally the necessary public resolve should stronger military measures be needed. Finally it was directed at the U.S. public, whose appreciation of national interests in Southeast Asia might be strengthened through observation of combined executive-legislative and bipartisan political support. 43 The United Nations was the target of a separate statement, on 5 August, as Ambassador Stevenson described the events in the Gulf for members of the Security Council and specifically related the DRV provoca-tion to the wider campaign of terror and infiltration occurring in South Vietnam and Laos. 44 This address was designed to establish the legitimacy of our actions in the Gulf under provisions of the UN Charter and to reaffirm that U.S. policy in Southeast Asia had limited aims and was based on upholding provisions of existing international agreements. The third communication was directed specifically to Hanoi, on 10 August, through the Canadian I.C.C. representative and was intended to strengthen the warning which he conveyed on his initial visit. In 14       7  addition to repeating points made earlier, Seaborn's second message conveyed the U.S. Government's uncertainty over DRV intentions in the 4 August attack and explained that subsequent U.S. deployments of additional airpower to South Vietnam and Thailand were "precautionary." In addition, the new message stressed (1) that the Tonkin Gulf events demonstrated that "U.S. public and official patience" was wearing thin; (2) that the Congressional Resolution reaffirmed U.S. determination "to con-tinue to oppose firmly, by all necessary means, DRV efforts to subvert and conquer South Vietnam and Laos"; and (3) that "if the DRV persists in its present course, it can expect to suffer the consequences." 45 Thus, in the immediate aftermath of the provocation handed the U.S. Government in the Tonkin Gulf, the Administration was able to carry out most of the actions recommended by its principal officials early in the summer. By the same token, it was reducing the number of unused measures short of direct military action that had been conceived as available for exerting effective pressure on the DRV. In effect, as it made its com-mitments in Southeast Asia clearer it also deepened them, and in the process it denied itself access to some of the uncommitting options which it had perceived earlier as .offering policy flexibility. 46 Meanwhile, other events were also having the effect of denying options which had been considered useful alternatives to strikes against the North. 15       37  III POST-TONKIN POLICY ASSESSMENTS The Tonkin Gulf incidents were important not only because of what they enabled the United States to do in response but also because of the way what was done began to be regarded by policy-makers . The fact that U.S. forces had responded to hostile acts by making direct attacks on North Vietnam, albeit limited ones under unique circumstances, had rather significant impacts on the Administration's policy judgments. These impacts appeared as it became increasingly evident that the United States actually had fewer options than it once believed available. DILEMMAS IN LAOS One of the areas where the Administration first saw its freedom of action being impaired was Laos. Prior to the events in Tonkin Gulf, the situation in Laos had become increasingly complex, thus making U.S. policy choices increasingly deIicate. Since the end of May, U.S. hopes for a stabilized Laos had been based largely on a Polish proposal to convene a preliminary con-ference among six nations. 47 Particularly promising was the Soviet Union's willingness to support the proposal. Toward the end of June, as the Laotian government warned of the imminent threat of a major communist offensive near Muong Soui, the Soviet Union asked Great Britain to postpone efforts toward such a conference, and the Poles seemed to back away from their original initiative. On 25 July the Soviet Union announced her return to the l4-Nation formula, and threatened to resign her co-chairman role if a conference were not called. 48 The Soviet threat to withdraw from the international machinery that is basic to the neutralist Laotian government's claim to legitimacy was a matter of considerable mutual concern in Vientiane and Washington. 49 One of the major reasons for U.S. support of the Polish 6-Nation preliminary conference was its value in forestalling pressure for a Geneva-type meeting. It was hoped that such a conference could be pro-longed well into the autumn to give the political and military situation in South Vietnam time to be improved, and to build a more favorable political climate for an eventual l4-Nation conference on Laos. The latter could be accomplished, it was hoped, by (1) demonstrating the extent of communist responsibility for Iaotian instability; (2) getting the I.C.C. to function more effectively; (3) strengthening international backing for Souvanna's position; and (4) thereby obtaining support for his insistence on Pathet Lao withdrawal from the Plaine des Jarres as a precondition for a new Geneva settlement. 50 Insofar as Laos was concerned, the United States recognized that a new conference was probably desirable, as long as it did not occur too soon. However, it also recog-nized the suspicion with which the GVN would regard any kind of negotiations . 16 ' .      over Southeast Asia and the likelihood that back-corridor discussions of the Vietnamese problem would be an almost inevitable by-product. In time such a procedure might be useful, but for the balance of 1964 it was to be avoided in order to promote GVN stability and encourage a more vigorous GVN war effort. 51 The pressure for a Geneva-type conference had been building ever  since the resumption of fighting in Laos in May. The chief protagonist in the quest for negotiations was France, who first proposed reconvening the l4-Nation Conference to deal with the crisis on 20 May. what made French policy so dangerous to U.S. interests, however, was that its interest in a Geneva solution applied to Vietnam as well. On 12 June, DeGaulle publicly repeated his neutralization theme for all Indo-China and called for an end to all foreign intervention there; on 23 July he proposed reconvening the 1954 Geneva Conference to deal with the problems of Vietnam. The Soviet Unions return to the l4-Nation formula in July (it had endorsed the original French proposal before indicating willingness to support the 6-Nation approach) indicated solidarity in the communist camp. The call was endorsed by North Vietnam on the following day. Communist China first announced support for a l4-Nation Conference (on Laos) on 9 June, repeating this through notes to the co-chairman calling on the l3th for an "emergency meeting." On 2 August, the Chinese urged the USSR not to carry out its threat to abandon its co-chairman role, apparently viewing such a development as jeopardizing the possibilities for a Geneva settlement. 52 Great Britain also urged the Russians to stay on, and during the last days of July it attempted to make arrangements in Moscow to convene a l4-Nation assembly on Laos. The negotiations failed because Britian insisted on Souvannas prerequisite that the communists withdraw from positions taken in May and was unable to gain Soviet acquiescence. However, U.S. leaders were aware that Britains support on this point could not be counted on indefinitely in the face of increasing pressure in the direction of Geneva. 53 In the meantime, however, Laotian military efforts to counter the communist threat to key routes and control points west of the Plaine des Jarres were showing great success. As a result of a counteroffensive (Operation Triangle), government forces gained control of a considerable amount of territory that gave promise of assuring access between the two capitals (Vientiane and Luang Prabang) for the first time in three years. 54 In effect, the government's newly won control of territory and communication routes in Central Laos created a new and more favorable balance of power in that country, which in the perceptions of the Administration should not be jeopardized. A threat to this balance from either (1) communist reactions to additional pressure, or (2) Laotian insistence on extending their offensive into the Plaine des Jarres,was cited to discourage proposals near the end of July to permit the VNAF to 17     f  bomb infiltration routes in the Laotian Panhandle. 55 This "don't rock the boat" policy was given added encouragement when, on 1 August, Great Britain initiated a promising effort toward a new diplomatic solution. Acting on Souvanna Phouma's request, the British government urged the I.C.C. members to arrange a meeting among the three Laotian political factions. 56 Concern over not provoking a communist military escalation that would upset the relatively stabilized situation in Inos figured promi-nently in a tentative analysis of U.S. strategy for Southeast Asia made and circulated for comment by the State Department in mid-August. It had a significant impact on the Administration's assessment of its options in the post-Tonkin period. Among other effects, this concern caused it to withhold for several weeks its approval of continuing proposals for air and ground initiatives in the Panhandle as means to improve the situation in South Vietnam. 57 CONCERN OVER PRESSURES FOR NEGOTIATIONS One of the Tonkin Gulf impacts which was perceived within the Administration served to exacerbate its policy dilemmas regarding Laos. Administration officials were apprehensive that the international crisis precipitated by incidents in the Gulf might intensify the kind of Geneva conference pressures generated previously. 58 Administration concern was apparently well founded. On 5 August UN Secretary General U Thant stated that the l4-Nation assembly should be reconvened to deal with the Tonkin Gulf debate then being urged on the UN Security Council. (He had earlier urged reconvening the 1954 Conference to negotiate a Vietnam settlement.) Two days later, during the debate, the French delegation urged the calling of a conference for the pacification of all of Indo-China. Reports appeared on 10 August that the Chinese People's Daily published an editorial arguing that a Geneva settlement was the only effective way to solve the problem of South Vietnam. On the l9th, in a note rejecting potential UN Security Council findings regarding responsibility for the Tonkin Gulf incidents, North Vietnam declared its insistence on a Geneva conference. 59 Such was the Administration's concern in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, that it contemplated a diplomatic initiative relating to Laos that was designed to counteract the expected pressure. Reflecting a point of view reportedly also becoming attractive to Souvanna Phouma, the State Department sought reactions to a policy direction that would no longer insist.on Pathet Ino withdrawal from the Plaine des Jarres as a precondition to an international conference. The gains recently achieved through "Operation Triangle11 were so significant, it reasomed, that they more than offset communist control of the Plaine. And it was clear that any negotiations by which a communist withdrawal might be arranged would include reciprocal demands for the government to relinquish its recently won gains. 60 Moreover, passage of the Congressional Resolution and the strong DRV naval attacks had accomplished the exact kind of actions believed to be necessary earlier to demonstrate U.S.  ----------------------- 18     By NWD Dale 2011  firmness in the event negotiating pressure should become compelling. 61 Reactions to this tentative policy change were unfavorable. It was seen as likely to have a demoralizing impact on the GVN. It was also seen as possibly eroding the impression of strong U.S, resolve, which the reprisal air strikes were believed to have created. For example, Ambassador Taylor cabled; "...rush to conference table would serve to confirm to CHICOMS that U.S. retaliation for destroyer attacks was transient phenomenon and that firm CHICOM response in form of commitment to defend NVN has given U.S. "Paper tiger" second ' thoughts "In Vietnam sudden backdown from previously strongly held U.S. position on Plaine des Jarres withdrawal prior to con-ference on Laos would have potentially disastrous effect. Morale and will to fight and particular willingness to push ahead with arduous pacification task...would be undermined by what would look like evidence that U.S. seeking to take advantage of any slight improvement in non-Communist position as excuse for extricating itself from Indo-China via conference route "Under circumstances, we see very little hope that results of such a conference would be advantageous to us. Moreover, prospects of limiting it to consideration of only Laotian problem appear at this time juncture to be dimmer than ever" 62 CONCERN OVER TONKIN REPRISAL SIGNALS Contained in Ambassador Taylor's views was yet another of the Administration's reflections on the impact of the Tonkin Gulf incidents. Officials developed mixed feelings regarding the effect of the Tonkin reprisals for signaling firm U.S. commitments in Southeast Asia. On one hand, it was conceded that the reprisals and the actions which acccm-panied them represented the most forceful expression of U.S. resolve to date. Improvements were perceived in South Vietnamese morale, and the combination of force and restraint demonstrated was believed effective in interrupting communist momentum and forcing a reassessment of U.S. intentions. 63 On the other hand, they reflected concern that these effects might not last and that the larger aspects of U.S. determination might still be unclear. Several officials and agencies indicated that our actions in the .Tonkin Gulf represented only one step along a continually demanding route for the United States. They expressed relief that if a persuasive impression of firmness were to be created relative to the general security of Southeast Asia, we could not rest on our laurels. Ambassador Taylor expressed the limited impact of the Tonkin Gulf action as follows 19       ' "It should be remembered that our retaliatory action in Gulf of Tonkin is in effect an isolated U.S.-DRV incident. Although this has relation. .to the larger problem of DRV aggression by subversion in Viet-Nam and Laos, we have not (repeat not) yet come to grips in a forreful way with DRV over the issue of this larger and much more complex problem. 64 Later, he described a need for subsequent actions that would convey to Hanoi that "the operational rules with respect to the DRV are changing." 65 Assistant Secretary of State Bundy believed that Hanoi and Peking had probably been convinced only "that we will act strongly where U.S. force units are directly involved...thaf7 in other respects the communist side may not be so persuaded that we are prepared to take stronger action" He saw the need for a continuous "combination of military pressure and some form of communication" to cause Hanoi to accept the idea of "getting out" of South Vietnam and Laos. 66 CINCPAC stated that "what we have not done and must do is make plain to Hanoi and Peiping the cost of pursuing their current objectives and impeding oursOur actions of August 5 have created a momentum which can lead to the attainment of our objectives in S.E. AsiaIt is most important that we not lose this momentum." 67 The JCS urged actions to "sustain the U.S. advantage recently gained," and later cautioned "Failure to resume and maintain a program of pressure through military actions... could signal a lack of resolve." 68 What these advisors had in mind by way of actions varied somewhat but only in the extent to which they were willing to go in the immedi-ate future. Bundy stressed that policy commitments must be such that U.S. and GVN hands could be kept free for military actions against DRV infiltration routes in Laos. Ambassador Taylor, CINCPAC and the JCS urged prompt air and ground operations across the Laotian border to interrupt the current (though modest) southward flow of men and supplies. Both Taylor and CINCPAC indicated the necessity of building up our "readiness posture" to undertake stronger actions through additional deployments of forces and logistical support elements and strengthening of the GVN political base. The mood and attitudes reflected in these viewpoints were concrete and dramatic expressions of the increased U.S. commitment stemming from the Tonkin Gulf incidents. They were candidly summed up by CINCPAC in his statement "...pressures against the other side once instituted should not be rclaxed by any actions or lack of them which would destroy the benefits of the rewarding steps previously taken" 69 Increasingly voiced by officials from many quarters of the Admin-istration and from the professional agencies were arguments which said, in effect, now that we have gone this far we cannot afford to stop and go no farther; our original signal must continually be reinforced. What 20  .    By NWD Date- '>011 r- n-- .  was not stated at least not in documentary form were estimates of how long the process might have to continue or to what extent the actions might have to be carried. REASSERTIGN OF THE R0STQW THESIS Soon after the Tonkin Gulf incidents State Department Counselor walt Rostow reformulated and circulated his earlier thesis that insurgencies supported by external powers must be dealt with through measures to neutralize the sources of that support. First presented to President Johnson in December 1963, variations on this theme had been proposed by Rostow at various times throughout 1964, the most recent occasion being in June, right after the Honolulu Conference. 70 Now in mid-August, his newly articulated arguments were passed to the white House, Department of State, Department of Defense and the JCS. The "Rostow thesis" was generalized not explicitly dealing with a particular insurgency but it was evident that considerations of the U.S. dilemmas in Southeast Asia affected its formulation. It started with a proposition "By applying limited, graduated military actions reinforced by political and economic pressures on a nation providing external support for insurgency, we should be able to cause that nation to decide to reduce greatly or eliminate altogether support for the insurgency. The objective of these pressures is not necessarily to attack his ability to provide support, although economic and certain military actions would in fact do just that. Rather, the objective is to affect his calculation of interests. Therefore, the threat that is implicit in initial U.S. actions would be more important than the military effect of the actions themselves." 71 In Rostov's view, the target governments "calculation of interests" could be affected by a number of factors, none of which would preclude, however, the need for effective counterinsurgency programs within the country already under attack. The factors included (1) loss, and fear of further loss, of military and economic facilities; (2) fear of involvement in a much larger conflict; (3) fear of increased dependence upon, and loss of independent action to, a major communist country; and (4) fear of internal political upheaval and loss of power. The coercive impacts of the pressures were to be their principal objectives. Significant (in view of currently espoused rationale for increased pressures on North Vietnam) was the explicit caution that impro red morale in the country troubled by insurgency and "improved U.S. bargaining leverage in any international conference on the conflict" were to be considered merely as "bonus effects." The coercive pressure was to result from "damaging military actions" coupled with concurrent political, economic and psychological pressures. The former could include selective or full naval blockade and "surgical" .21  .     43  destruction of specific targets by aerial bombardment or naval gunfire. They could be supported by such non-destructive military actions as aerial reconnaissance, harassment of civil aviat.on and maritime com-merce, mock air attacks, and timely concentrations of U.S. or a. re forces at sea or near land borders. Following a line o. reasoning prevalent in the Government during the early 60's, Roscow o serve that a target government might well reduce its insurgency suppor mg . role in the face of such pressures because of the communists proverbial "tactical flexibility." 72 The thesis was subjected to a rather thorough analysis in OSDISA and coordinated with the Department of State. The nature o -is rev re will be discussed on later pages and in a different conte ACCOMPANYING PAUSE IN PRESSURES The foregoing policy assessments were conducted in an atmosphere relatively free of even those pressure measures that prece e ' Tonkin Gulf crisis.

S of engagement for U.S. forces in Southeast Asia. This was accomplisne in response to JCS urging that attacking forces not be permi e sanc fran which to regroup and perhaps repeat their hostile acts.  rjL rules had not permitted pursuit of hostile aircraft outside out le nam or authorized intercept of intruders over Thailand. 75. er I+rmr rules of 15 August 1964, U.S. forces were authorized to attack and dest y any vessel or aircraft "which attacks, or gives positive indica ion o intent to attack" U.S. forces operating in or over international waters and in Laos, to include hot pursuit into the territorial waters or air space of North Vietnam and into the air space over other countrres oi Southeast Asia.

( Another prerequisite to wider military action that was accomplished was the combined GVN-U.S. planning for cross-border ground opera cions.

At least, belief in an increase in th te of this infiltration apparently gained currency in various neither this time. The documents available to this writer b -e P refute nor substantiate the increase, but several c. t" ) ?n references to this perception. For example, a State ,p-l men randum, dated 24 August, acknowledged a "rise and change in e " of infiltration in recent months." 80 later analyses eouTxmed that Increases had taken place, but the precise period iz .en esa not identified. 81 Henk, unless there were otter inteU S to conrinra them, any implications regarding North Ven r.esc p . sions were largely speculative.        Possibly influencing the judgments of August was the fact that increased communist movement of men and supplies to the South was expected, resulting in part from a DIA assessment (7 August) of the most likely DRV reactions to the Tonkin reprisals. 82 Moreover, the State Department's analysis of next courses of action in Southeast Asia had made "clear evidence of greatly increased infiltration from the North" an explicit condition for any policy judgment that "systematic military action against DRV" was required during the balance of 1964. 83 And leading officials from several agencies were beginning to feel that such action might be inevitable. The combined effects of the signs of increased VC infiltration and of continuing upheaval in Saigon caused great concern in washington. The central perception was one of impending chaos and possible failure in South Vietnam. Among several agencies, the emerging mood was that some kind of action was urgently needed -- even if it had the effect merely of improving the U.S. image prior to pulling out. It was this mood that prevailed as the period of "pause" drew to a close. 24 TOP SEC PCTSc nr itive     By NWD Date 201 1 HC  IV NEXT COURSES OF ACTION By early September a general consensus had developed among high-level Administration officials that some form of additional and continuous pressure should be exerted against North Vietnam. Though Laos was relatively stabilized, the situation there was recognized as dependent ultimately on the degree of success achieved in solving the problems of Vietnam. Pacification efforts within South Vietnam were regarded as insufficient by themselves to reverse the deteriorating trends in that country. As a result, officials from both civilian and military agencies were anxious to resume and to extend the program of military actions against communist forces outside its borders. STRATEGY MEETING IN SEPTIFEER How to go about this was a problem of great concern to top-level officials (the President, Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, General wheeler, Ambassador Taylor, CIA Director McCone) as they assembled in washington on 7 September. The main purpose of the meeting was to discuss with Ambassador Taylor future courses of U.S. and GVN action, particularly as related to the implications of the recent political upheaval in Saigon. The alternatives presented for discussion were based largely on responses to the tentative analysis circulated by the State Department in mid-August. Replies from CINCPAC and the Saigon and Vientiane embassies had been circulated, and they provided the basis for a number of questions which Ambassador Taylor's party was asked to be ready to discuss. 84 JCS reactions to the analysis and to the earlier replies were submitted to the Secretary of Defense with the specific intent that they be considered at the meeting and presumably were passed to other participating agencies. 85 OSDISA views were prepared by Assistant Secretary McNaughton on 3 September and were known at least to Assistant Secretary of State Bundy. 86 Just prior to the meeting, the JCS urged that General wheeler, their Chairman, propose a course of action involving air strikes against targets in North Vietnam appearing on the JCS-approved, 94-target list. 90 This kind of action had been recommended before -- most recently on 26August, in response to the Department of State analysis as a means of "destroying the DRV will and capabilities, as necessary, to continue to support the insurgencies in South Vietnam and Laos." what made this proposal particularly significant was that it called for deliberate attempts to provoke the DRV into taking actions which could then be answered by a systematic U.S. air campaign. According to the JCS scheme, the campaign "would be continuous and in ascending severity," with its tempo and intensity varied as required by enemy reactions. Targets would eventually include airfields, bridges, railroads, military installations, industrial facilities and armed route reconnaissance along the LOC's. The JCS argued that such actions were now "essential to prevent a complete collapse of the U.S. position in the Republic of Vietnam and Southeast Asia," because "continuation of present or foreseeable programs limited to the RVN will not produce the desired 25 TOP. SECRET .      result." 88 Quite similar language also appeared in the 26 August memorandum. whether or not or in what form General wheeler presented this pro-posal to the assembled officials on 7 September is not indicated in the documentary sources available. The JCS belief in the necessity of bombing North Vietnam was discussed, as was some of their rationale. Made explicit, for example, was their argument that there was no reason to delay the bombing since (in their view) the situation in South Vietnam would only become worse. 89 That the idea of deliberately provoking a DRV reaction was discussed in some form is indicated in a record of the consensus arrived at in the discussions. 90 However, the JCS were not the only officials who favored such an idea. Assistant Secretary McNaughton's "Plan of Action" (3 September 1964) also called for actions that "should be likely at some point to provoke a military DRV response.'1 The latter, in turn, should be likely to provide good grounds for us to escalate if we wished." 91 The principal confereees did not believe that deliberately provocative actions should be undertaken "in the immediate future while the GVN is still struggling to its feet." However, they apparently reached a consensus that they might recommend such actions -- "depending on GVN progress and Communist reaction in the meantime" -- by early October. 92 The reasons cited for their opposition to provocative acts were also applied in rejecting proposals for an immediate bombing campaign. The GVN was expected to be too weak for the United States to assume the 'delib-erate risks of escalation that would involve a major role for, or threat to, South Vietnam." 93 In the discussion, Mr. McCone observed that undertaking a sustained attack on the DRV would be very dangerous, due to the weakness and unpredictability of the political base in South Vietnam. Secretary Rusk stated the view that every means short of bombing must be exhausted. Secretary McNamara affirmed his understanding that "we are not acting more strongly because there is a clear hope of strengthening the GVN." But he went on to urge that the way be kept open for stronger actions even if the GVN did not improve or in the event the war were widened by the communists. It is interesting to note that the President asked speci-fically, "Can we really strengthen the GVN?" 94 Even though the principals did not accept the JCS proposal and apparently did not agree with their assessment of the chances for improvement in South Vietnam, they did indicate accord .with the JCS sense of the gravity of the U.S. predicament. In response to General wheeler's state-ments that "if the United States loses in South Vietnam, it will lose all of Southeast Asia" and that its position throughout all of Asia would be damaged, both McCone and Risk indicated agreement. Ambassador Taylor .stated the view that the United States could not afford to let Ho Chi Minh win in South Vietnam. Secretary Rusk added the consideration that the whole world doubted our ability to pull it off. 95 26       I?  The meeting resulted in consensus among the principals on certain courses of prompt action to put additional pressure on North Vietnam. The following measures were recommended to the President for his decision "1. U.S. naval patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin should be resumed immediately (about September 12). They should operate initially beyond the l2-mile limit and be clearly dissociated from 34A maritime operations "2. 34A operations by the GVN should be resumed immediately thereafter (next week). The maritime operations are by far the most important "3- Limited GVN air and ground operations into the corridor areas of Inos should be undertaken in the near future, together with Lao air strikes as soon as we can get Souvanna's permission. These operations will have only limited effect, however. "4. we should be prepared to respond on a tit-for-tat basis against the DRV against specific and related targets) in the event of ary attack on U.S. units or any special DRVVC action against SVN."96 The purposes for these measures were conceived as (1) "to assist morale in SVN," (2) to "show the Communists we still mean business," and (3)"to keep the risks low and under our control at each stage." IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS These recommendations (and presumably the purposes) were approved by the President and became the basis for a program of limited (though not continuous) pressures exerted against North Vietnam from mid-September to mid-December 1964. On 10 September, the white House issued a National Security Action Memorandum which authorized immediate resumption of the DE SOTO Patrols and prompt discussions with the Government of Laos to develop plans for cross-border operations. It also authorized resumption of 34A operations following completion of the DE SOTO Patrol, with the additional guidance that "we should have the GVN ready to admit that they are taking place and to justify and legitimize them on the basis of the facts of VC infiltration by sea." 97 It is significant that although this order, in effect, authorized the initiation of Phase III (October through December) of the covert operations under OPLAN 34A, it specified contrary to the provisions of Phase III that "we should not consider air strikes under 34A for the present."

The mission representatives agreed that, once the operations began, they should not be acknowledged publicly. In effect,, then, they would supplement the other covert pressures being exerted against North Vietnam. Moreover, while the Lao Government would of course know about the operations of their T-28s, Souvanna was not to be informedof the GVNU.S. operations. The unacknowledged nature of these operations would thus be easier to maintain. Accordingly, the representatives recommended to washington that Vientiane be authorized to approach the Laotian Govern-ment regarding initiation of T-28 operations. On the other hand, the Administration was asked to approve ground operations in three speci re areas of the Panhandle. 105 Over two weeks passed before these recommendations were acted on. In the meantime, the JCS also submitted proposals for implementing NSAM 311, requesting immediate authority to implement air operations, in the Pan an' e. Endorsing the main theme of the mission representatives, they called. or combined action by RLAF T-28s and U.S. aircraft which would provide sup-pressive fire" and attack heavily defended bridges. The JCo also soug authority to initiate GVN ground intelligence collection and tax gee recon naissance patrols in the Laotian corridor. 106 On 6 October, authority was given the Vientiane Enbassy to urge the Laotian Government to begin T-28 air strikes "as soon as possible. The RLAF targets were to be selected from a previously coordinated.22-target list, a few of which were designed for U.S. YANKEE TEAM strikes, but they were to exclude Mu Gia Pass. The latter mission was known to require U.S. escort and suppressive fire, and a decision on whether to authorize such U.S. operations had not yet been made in Washington. More-over, neither had the Administration authorized YANKEE TEAM strike missions against the tougher Panhandle targets. 101 Administration rationale on the issue of U.S. participation in. the Panhandle air strikes is not clear from the sources available.to tms writer. Contemporary intelligence estimates indicated the communist responses were likely to be limited to (1) increases in anciaircra.t deploy-ments in the area, (2) propaganda attacks and (3) possible sabotage oi U.o. GVN supporting bases. 103 However, washington's viewpoint on another Laotian request for air support may be significant, with respect to dir strikes against targets along Route 7, in support of the RLG campaign to consolidate its holdings west of the Plaine des Jarres, Administration rationale was as follows "Since we wish to avoid the impression that we are taking the first step in escalation, we are inclined . 29        to defer decision on Route 7 strikes until we have strong evidence of Hanoi's preparation for new attack in the Plaine des Jarres, some of which might come from RLAF opera-tions over the Route." 109 On 13 October, one day before the initial RLAF attacks, U.S. strikes were again requested on four defended targets near Nape and Tchepone. They were to accompany T-28 strikes on communist military installations and supply points in the northern part of the Panhandle. 110 The significance of these operations, and U.S. participation in chem, was indicated a few days earlier in another meeting among representatives of the three missions. It was reported at this time that it was probable "that ARVN will be unable to afford detachment ofZ any significant u ground capability for the Laotian Corridor in the foreseeable future. Therefore, air operations would offer the only dependable means of combatting VC infiltration through Laos. The participants recorded unanimous agreement that U.S. participation in air operations in the corridor is essential if such operations are to have desrred military and psycho ogica impact." Emphasizing that the initiative for these operations came from the United States Government, they pointed out that failure to particlpate could result in loss of control over them and could even jeopardize their continuation. At min5mum the group recommended that U.S. aircraft fly CAP (combat air patrol) over the RLAF aircraft, as requested by the Laotian Government and as permitted by a "relatively minor extension of existing U.S. rules of engagement. 111 CAP missions were approved, but U.S. air strikes against com- munist LOCs in the Laotian Panhandle were not authorized until much lacer in the year. 112 Cross-border ground operations did not receive au h-orization at any time during the period covered in this study. NEGOTIATING POSTURE RE LAOS One reason for the delay in requesting Iaotian air strikes in the Panhandle was the need to await the uncertain outcome of discussions in Paris among leaders of the three Laotian political factions. Since 2( August, when they first met, the three Princes (Souvanna Phouma, Souphanouvang, and Boun Oum) had reached an impasse on conditions to accompany a cease-fire. Souvanna Phouma insisted on communist withdrawal from positions won in the May offensive and had proposed neutralization of the Plaine des Jarres under I.C.C. supervision. 113 On 15 September, when it seemed that further negotiations had become fruitless, Prince Souphanouvang. offered to withdraw communist forces from the Plaine in return for dis-cussions leading to a new l4-Nation Conference. The following day, Souvanna countered with a proposal that a cease-fire Degin on 1 October and attempted to verify and make more explicit the mutual concessions. The pro-communist leader balked over stipulated guarantees, such as I.C.C. supervision, that pro-communist forces would in fact withdraw and be replaced by neutralists. However, on the 2lst, the leaders arrived at agreement for continued meetings at thc ministerial level, based on an agenda which included a cease-fire        and preliminary conditions for reconvening a Geneva conference. 114 The narrow margin by which the cease-fire agreement failed to come about dramatized the delicate nature of the Administration's diplomatic position in Laos. Having agreed to support the tripartite discussions prior to the Tonkin Gulf incidents and prior to the political upheaval in Saigon, it felt constrained to go along with them particularly if they served to forestall movement toward a Geneva-type negotiation. However, a Laotian cease-fire was not compatible with current perceptions of U.S. interest even if it resulted in communist withdrawal frcm the Plaine des Jarres. Ambassador Unger pointed out the contradictory nature of our position in his reply to the State Department's mid-August analysis of future U.S. courses of action. 115 Ambassador Taylor emphasized the need to maintain the option of operations in the Panhandle in his reply also, and the September discussions in Washington confirmed that his view was shared by most of the President's advisors. One could conclude that the United States was fortunate that Prince Souphanouvang was so intransigent on the issue of I.C.C. supervision. It is also possible that in insisting on this provision to the leftist prince Souvanna Phouma "knew his man" -- perhaps reflecting perceptive American advice. Certainly the course of the tripartite discussions followed a pattern commensurate with prior U.S. calculation. In an assessment of future courses of action used as the basis for the policy analysis cabled to affected interested embassies and CINCPAC by the State Department, Assistant Secretary Bundy characterized U.S. strategy with the statement, "we would wish to slow down any progress toward a conference" He then referred to a specific negotiating position proposed by Ambassador Unger (a proposal for tripartite administration of the Plaine des Jarres) as "a useful delaying gambit." 116 Significantly, this proposal was advanced at Paris by Souvanna Phouma on 1 September illustrating the fact that Souvanna was carefully advised by U.S. diplomats both prior to and during the Paris meetings. 117 Other features of Souvannas negotiating posture which apparently were encouraged as likely to have the effect of drawing out the discussions were insistence on communist acceptance of (1) Souvannas political status as Premier and (2) unhampered operations by the I.C.C. 118 It will be recalled that the latter point was the issue on which progress toward a cease-fire became stalled. It is important to note here that the State Department recognized that Souvanna Phouma might well act on his own and feel compelled to move toward a conference, even at the price of a cease-fire. In such an event, our position was to be dependent on conditions in South Vietnam "If the timing of the Laos Conference, in relation to . the degree of pressures we had then set in motion against the DRV, was such that our attending or accepting the conference would have major morale drawbacks in South Viet-Nam, we might well have to refuse to attend ourselves and to accept the disadvantage of having no direct participation. In the last analysis, GVN morale would have to be the deciding factor." 11931  .      It is apparent from this and other documents that GVI',s T 1 morale were perceived by the Administration as the princpa elements for Southeast Asian policy in the post-To an pe ANTICIPAT1ON OF WIDER ACTION Through most of the strategy discussions 01 ear.. asing fre-Vietnam was the main focus of attention.

Should specific provocations not occur, a contingency target date of 1 January 1965 was indicated 124 "...in the absence of such major new developments incidents or increased infiltration, we should probably be thinking of a contingency date for planning purposes, as suggested by Ambassador Taylor, of 1 January 1965." 125 The working paper elaborated more fuJly than the cable the kind of preliminary actions considered necessary to set the stage. Some of this elaboration was provided in suggested language changes penciled-in by OSD prior to an inter-agency meeting called to discuss its contents. Refer-ring to air strikes in the Panhandle (proposed to begin in September), a suggested OSD addition stated "The strikes should probably be timed and plotted on the map to bring them to the borders of North Vietnam at the end of December." The main body of the text suggested that the January operations include "action against infiltration routes and facilities" as "probably the best opening gambit." It explained that "the family of infiltration-related targets starts with clear military installations near the borders and can be extended almost at will northward." The "next upward move" was suggested to include action against "military-related targets," such as "POL installations and the mining of Haiphong Harbor" and "key bridges and railroads." The purpose perceived for these operations was "to inflict progressive damage that would have a meaningful cumulative effect." 126 Ambassador Taylor viewed 1 January 1965 as a "target D-Day" before which the U.S. Mission and the GVN should develop "a posture of maximum readiness for a deliberate escalation of pressure against North Viet Nam." The nature of this escalation was perceived as "a carefully orchestrated bombing attack on NVN, directed primarily at infiltration and other mili-tary targets." It would consist of "U.S. reconnaissance planes, VNAFFARMGATE air-craft against those targets which could be attacked safely in spite of the presence of the MIGs, and additional U.S. combat aircraft if necessary for the effective execution of the bombing programs." He qualified this assessment with the observation, "We must always recog-nize, however, that events may force the U.S. to advance D-Day to a considerably earlier date." The reason for this qualification was Taylors concern that the GVN might not be able to sustain its authority until .January. Thus, in order to "avoid the possible consequences of a collapse of national morale" it would be necessary, he felt, "to open the campaign against the DRV without delay." The nature of the air campaign "would be essentially the same" as under the January scheme, except that it would rely "almost exclusively on U.S. military means." 127       5  Similar assessments of timing in relation to more vigorous military action against North Vietnam were made in OSDISA. The immed-iate measures proposed in McNaughtons draft "Plan of Action for South Vietnam" (3 September) were conceived not only as means to provoke North Vietnam into responses justifying U.S. punitive actions. They were also believed to make possible the postponement "probably until November or December" of a decision regarding the more serious escalation. In McNaughtons terminology the latter were referred to as "a crescendo of GVN-U.S. military actions against the DRV," but they included a variety of possibilities "The escalating actions might be naval pressures or mining of harbors; or they might be made up of air strikes against North Vietnam moving from southern to northern targets, from targets associated with infiltration and by-then-disclosed DRV-VC radio command nets to targets of military then industrial importance, and from missions which could be handled by the VNAF alone to those which could be carried out only by the U.S." 128 It is clear, however, that what was contemplated was a pattern of gradu-ally mounting pressures intended to impress the DRV with the increasing gravity of its situation. Records of the September conference do not indicate that a decision was made relative to an explicit January contingency date. In several respects they do make clear that the possibility of escalation at the end of the- year was considered. For example, hope was expressed that the GVN would grow stronger over the following two to three months --by implication, strong enough to permit "major deliberate risks of escalation" or "deliberately provocative" U.S. actions. 129 Directly related to this hope was the intention of having the GVN admit publicly to its conduct of maritime operations against North Vietnamese coastal installations and communications. The aim was "to justify and legitimize them on the basis of the facts of VC infiltration by sea." 130 It was believed that this step would be useful in establishing a climate of opinion more receptive to expanded (air) operations against North Vietnam when they should become necessary. 131 Reservations. By October 1964, therefore, there was a general belief among the President's top advisors that it would probably be necessary eventually to subject North Vietnam to overt military pressure. Many were convinced, however reluctantly, that it would not be possible to obtain an effective solution to the problem of DRV sponsorship of the insurgency in South Vietnam or a permanent solution to the political strife in Laos without such direct pressure on the instigator of these problems. Significantly, these views were dissimilar in character to the interest in graduated pressures shown in the Spring and to the determination "to use force if necessary" urged on the President at the end of May. For  .      most of the principal advisors, the earlier views had been clearly contingent upon a major reversalprincipally in Laos--and had been advanced with the apparent assumption that military actions hopefully would not be required. Now, however, their views were advanced' with a sense that such actions were inevitable. Moreover, they were advanced despite the perspective afforded by a number of critical evaluations of the use of military pressure. In addition to the studies made during the first half of 1964, all of the principal advisory agencies had reviewed a detailed critique of the so-called "Rostow thesis" just prior to the September strategy conference. The critique was accomplished in OSDISA with inputs and coordina-tion from State's Policy Planning Council. The assigned task was to make "a thorough analysis of and report on the Rostow thesis that covert aggression justifies and must be fought by attacks on the source of the aggression." Copies were distributed to the washington recipients of the Rostov paper, including the white House, Department of State, Department of Defense, the JCS and each of the services. In their summary analysis of the thesis the critiquers emphasized two variables which would determine its utility (1) the extent of the commitment of the nation furnishing external support and (2) the extent to which the insurgency affected vital U.S. interests, with regard to the former variable, they described "three fundamental conditions" which would have to exist to achieve success "in cases where the external opponent is committed to the extent of the North Vietnamese." The opponents would have to be persuaded that (1) the United States was "taking limited actions to achieve limited objectives;" (2) "the commitment of the military power of the United States to the limited objective is a total commitment as total as our commitment to get the missiles out of Cuba in October 1962;" (3) the United States has "established a sufficient consensus to see through this course of action both at home and on the world scene." Fur-ther, unless such an opponent were so persuaded, "the approach might well fail to be effective short of a major U.S. military involvement." 132 in  Essential to creating the necessary conviction of U.S. intent on the part of the opposing government, the analysis argued, was a firm image that the President and the U.S. public were in agreement that vital national interests were at stake. Unless vital interests were clearly at stake, "the limited military actions envisaged would not only involve much greater political costs at home and abroad...but there would be much greater risk that the program would not be effective except at high levels of . involvement and risk, and that it might be allowed to fa 11 short of such levels." In the analysts view, "this requirement of vital.interest would sharply limit the application of the thesis" among the world areas currently threatened. It observed that "Laos-Vietnam seems the only one in which a strong, ljut not necessarily conclusive, case can be made that this condition holds." 133 . 35        Assuming that vital U.S. interests were assessed as being at stake by an Administration in some unspecified case, the critiquers went on to outline some additional "conditions for success." First, an Administration would have to present a solid case to the U.S. Congress and public and to our allies that the external support pro-vided by the target nation was instrumental in sustaining the insurgency. In the interest of making its public case conclusive, "the U.S. would have to be prepared to expose intelligence data." Second, it would have to identify enemy targets "such that limited attacks and the threat of further attacks would bring great pressure on him to comply." Third, the U.S. Government would have to be able to communicate its case to the target nation "including the high degree of U.S. commitment and the limited nature of our objective." This would involve controlling both the U.S. and its a11ys actions "to convey limited objectives, minimizing incentives to comply. Finally, it would have to be capable of determining enemy compliance with our demands. 134 The critiquers' analysis included an assessment of the costs and risks to be incurred in applying the thesis and cautioned against its adoption as a general declaratory policy "Given present attitudes, application 01 the Rostow approach risks domestic and interna dona opposi tion ranging from anxiety and protest to condemna ion, efforts to disassociate from U.S. policies or a rances, or even strong countermeasures "Currently, then, it is the Rostow approach, rather than the measures it counters that would oe seen generally as an "unstabilizing" change in the rules o. the game, an escalation of conflict, an increasing of shared, interna-tional risks, and quite possibly, as an open aggressron demanding condemnation...particularly in genera erms 0-in abstraction from a specific, immediately c a enging situation. "On the other hand, the controlled, limited mili-tary actions implied in the Rostow approacn wou e ar more acceptable to the extent that they were seen o follow from Presidential conviction of vital national necessity in a specific context, and even more co ie extent that this conviction were shared by Congress ana the U.S. public. "An attempt to legitimize such actions in general terms, and in advance of an emergency situation, would not only be likely to fail, but might well evoke public ... +.. aTHpd ounositlon and denuncl- expressrons of domestic and alliect wumv ations, warnings, counterthreats and binding commitments .36  .     A  from opponents that would make it much more difficult for the President to contemplate this approach when an occasion actually arose" They went on to point out that accepting the Rostow thesis as a principle of U.S. declaratory policy would require making it public before applying it. The need to be assured of "Congressional and other public support in carrying through the thesis in a given case" would require this. Therefore, the analysts concluded, "It would be exceedingly unwise to make the Rostow thesis a declaratory policy unless the U.S. were prepared to act on it" -- but then only if we were assured of the public commit-ment and the capability to achieve success. with regard to the applicability of the thesis to the contemporary situation in Southeast Asia, the critiquers summarized their views as follows "...the situation in Vietnam and Inos is the only one in which a strong case can be made that the two major indications for the Rostow approach are made the ineffective-ness of alternatives and vital U.S. interests. Even in this case the degee of U.S. interest, the degree and acceptability of the risks, and the potential effectiveness of this approach are subject to question. In particular, the likelihood and the political costs of failure of the approach, and the pressures for U.S, escalation if early moves should fail, require serious examination.1' 136 DIFFERING AGENCY POLICY VIEWS In describing the evolution of Administration strategy this account has previously emphasized the points of general agreement among the Presidents advisors. Its purpose has been to describe the existence and sense of a policy consensus that had emerged by mid-October. However, significant differences of opinion existed among the various advisory agencies regarding what actions should be taken and how soon they should be initiated. These differences can be discerned with respect to five issues (1) whether and how soon the GVN maritime operations should be acknowledged; (2) the desirability of tit-for-tat reprisals; (3) how best to cope with enemy reactions to increased pressures on the DRV; (4) the degree of GVNU.S. readiness required before increasing the pressures; and (5) the relationship perceived between increased pressures and negotiations. JCS views. Senior military officials differed among themselves on the first three issues. CINCPAC apparently perceived difficulties resulting from official acknowledgements of GVN maritime operations and suggested that press leaks would achieve the desired effects on SVN morale. General Wheeler saw official acknowledgement as a means to legitimize the 37        operations and thereby enable their scope and effectiveness to be increased. However, he was not supported by the service chiefs. They opposed surfacing the GVN operations until they could become associated with the DE SOTO Patrols "or until the United States is prepared openly to support MAROPS militarily." 137 All of these officials agreed that it was necessary to undertake reprisals for a variety of hostile VC or DRV actions. In particular they wanted U.S. responses to be greater in degree, not necessarily matching in kind, than the provocations, where they came to differ was on the desirability of deliberately pro-voking DRV actions to which we could then respond. After the September white House meeting only the Air Force Chief of Staff and the Marine Commandant favored this approach. 138 Differences with respect to preparation for coping with enemy reactions to harsher pressures centered around the issue of committing greater numbers of U.S. ground forces to South Vietnam. CINCPAC, sup-porting General westmoreland's request, urged provision for deploymen of Marine and Army units to provide security for U.S.GVN opera mg bases. The JCS disagreed and disapproved a request to make such adjustments in OPLAN 37-64, on grounds that since VC capabillties were still questionable it was preferable not to precommit U.S. .orces in t .e manner urged. At issue concurrently was an Air Force proposal to reduce tne number of ground forces provided for in the event of a large sca e  CHICOM intervention in Southeast Asia and to rely more heavily on tactical air capabilities. The other chiefs disagreed, but the controversy con-cerning the relative emphasis on ground and air forces for the defcnse Southeast Asia was to occupy JCS attention for several months to cone. 1-9 Regarding the issue of readiness to increase pressures on North Vietnam and the role of negotiations, the military chiefs were in Sree ment throughout the period. Soon after the Tonkin Gulf lnci en s c ey urged prompt implementation of more serious pressures using Uair capabilities. They opposed B-57 training for the VNAF, clting its larnite pilot and supporting technical resources which would be nee e or coun er insurgency missions. In response to warnings that we shoula not get deeply involved in a conflict in Southeast Asia until we were surer o the GVNs commitment, they replied that "the United States is a rea y deeply involved." They went on to recommend preparations for deploying the remaining OPLAN 37-64 forces needed for mounting a U.S. air s r e program against North Vietnam. 140 while the JCS did not address the subject of negotiations explicitly during this period, their s aemen'8 implied a lack of interest in a negotiated solution to the Vre nam pro lem. At every opportunity they reiterated their recommendatron that we should attack North Vietnamese will and capabilities as necessary co force a DRV decision to halt its support and direction of the insurgency. 38  .      Saigon Embassy views. Ambassador Taylor opposed the views of his former military colleagues on most issues. Prior to e ep-tember meeting, he expressed objections to the idea of surfacing or leaking to the press the nature of GVN maritime operations. e a so opposed tit-fo.'-tat retaliation bombing for the reason tha i was "likely to release a new order of military reaction from bo sr es, the outcome of which is impossible to predict. He saw enemy groun assaults as a greater threat to U.S. bases in South Vietnam an enemy air attacks and supported the deployment of U.S. ground force urn s for base security purposes. This was to occur after the beginning o GVNU.S. ground and air cross-border operations into Laos. However, not unlike the Chiefs, one of the criteria he employed in shapwg his recommendation was the avoidance of a major U.S. ground force commi ment. 141 Ambassador Taylors views were apparently based on an under-lying rationale that actions to counter the VCDRV aggression stou- no outstrip the GVN and that if it could be avoided, the conflict shoud no be escalated to a level beyond South Vietnamese capacities to manage it. Although believing firmly that the United States would have co app y direct pressure against North Vietnam eventually, to force her o abandon her objectives, he felt that the major burden oi this el or should be borne by the GVN. Thus, his support for U.S. base security deployments was based in part on concern lest ARVN units be tie. own . in such roles and, thus, unavailable for more free-ranging com a . -mi larly, in August, the Enbassy favored immediate initiation of training for the VNAF to enable it to play a substantial role in the overt air attacks envisioned for 1965 This training -- like Saigons discouragement of U.S. eagerness to negotiate in Laos was also advocated for its value inbo s errng the GVNs morale and determination to continue fighting agains 1 s communist enemies. This same consideration was at the root 01 e Ambassador's belief that any negotiations which affected South Vietnam should be avoided until North Vietnam was subjected to more force military pressures. He also felt that communication with Hanoi should be preceded by a thorough discussion and understanding of our liml e war aims with the GVN. 142 The Ambassadors basic concern that the GVN be capable of and committed to supporting the evolving levels of war effort against the communists was indicated in his response to the political upheava in Saigon. Earlier, his recommendations had included the opcion of opening "the airj campaign against the DRV without delay, in the event of threatened collapse of the Khahn Government. The objective was to have been "to avoid the'possible consequences of a collapse of national morale." At the September meeting and subsequently, however, after Khahn had already been forced to step down from GVN leadership once and his new government was even shakier than two months earlier, the Ambassador opposed overt action against North Vietnam as too risky and urged instead that further measures to strengthen the GVN be taken first. 1 0 39  .      OSD views. OSD and OSDISA views were clearer on.some issues than on others. For example, the source documents indicate their consistent support for surfacing the GVN maritime operations. l Similarly, it is clear that OSD continually regarded negotiations as a necessary process for terminating the insurgency in South Vietnam and. a program of increased pressures against the DRV as a means of improving the U.S. bargaining position. Like other agencies, it saw negotiatrons as something that should not be entered into until the pressures were hurting North Vietnam, but it emphasized that the pattern of pressures should make clear our limited aims. 145 Equally consistent but less explicit were OSD views on GVNU.S. readiness to mount overt attacks on North Vietnam. Secretary McNamara was concerned that too early initiation of air action against North Vietnam might find the United States unprepared to cope with the con-sequences. At the end of August he directed the JCS to study and report on POL and ordnance stocks available to carry out approved contingency plans to combat a large-scale communist intervention after the expenditures required for the pattern of attacks which they proposed against. Nort t Vietnam. He also asked for specific recommendations on next steps to be taken in the event destruction of the proposed JCS targets did not destroy the DRV will and capability to continue. Mr. McNaughton s Plan of Action was intended to make unnecessary any decision concerning larger opera ions until late in the autumn. Moreover, it was designed explicitly to crea e as little risk as possible of the kind of military action which would le difficult to justify to the American public and to preserve where possible the option to have no U.S. military action at all. In September, OSDIS., was on record as favoring the initiation of bombing against North Vietnam after suitable provocation by Hanoi. But by mid-October che OoD view was apparently that overt actions against the North should be held off at least until the new year. 146 with respect to the other issues the most consistent aspect of OSD views was their prudence. Its attitudes toward tit-for-tat replisals are not really clear. Soon after Tonkin Gulf OSD notified the JCS that the events there precluded any further need for their work on retaliation scenarios in support of NSAM 288. Then, just three weeks later, the McNaughton "Plan of Action" proposed deliberate provocation of DRV actions to permit U.S. retaliation but as a means to begin a gradual squeeze on North Vietnam, not merely tit-for-tat reprisals. Mr. McNamara s own views do not appear except by implication, in that he did not indicate any opposition to them when shown william Bundys draft summacion o. the September meeting consensus. 147 Prudence was again the dominant feature of OSD views on preparations to cope with possible enemy reactions to the harsher pressures. For example, "on several occasions Secretary McNamara expressed to the JCS his interest in the possibility of countering a massive Chinese intervention in Southeast Asia without the need co intro-duce large numbers of U.S. ground forces. The OSD appraisal of the USAr 40  .      proposal to reduce provisional ground force levels for Southeast Asian defense concluded that the issue remained "open." It was crit-ical of that particular study because of its methodology and asgump-tions. Later, however, Mr. McNamara supported the JCS in their disapproval of the MACV request for allocatitn of additional ground force units for base security purposes. 148 State views. Various documents make it clear that there were several different points of view prevalent within the State Department during the period in question. Reflected here are those channeled through the Secretary of State or communicated to the Department of Defense, usually through the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, with few exceptions, the courses of action followed by the Administration were those advocated by State. Its proposal for B-57 training for the VNAF was apparently overruled on the basis of JCS recommendations, but otherwise its support for measures to further strengthen the GVN and for pressuring actions other than overt military attacks throughout 1964 prevailed. l4g Its support for the acknowledgement of GVN maritime operations failed to materialize only because of objections on the part of the GVN itself. 150 State Department views on the other issues, likewise, were reflected in U.S. policy positions. Reprisals for VC acts that could be matched with fitting responses were favored in principle but were not necessarily to be carried out in all instances. Escalation through such responses was seen as useful for purposes of assisting GVN morale, but State did not believe that steps should be taken to bring about such situations just yet. It did, however, acknowledge that deliberate provocations might be useful in the future. Negotiation of a Vietnam solution through an international conference was viewed as inevitable, but it should be permitted only after hurting North Vietnam and convincing South Vietnam of U.S. resolve to achieve its objectives. Moreover, Secretary Rusk, Assistant Secretary Bundy and Counselor Rostow were each known to view avoidance of a commitment of U.S. ground forces to Southeast Asia as an important element in policy. 151 CIA views. With the exception of Mr. McCone's opinions rendered in the September strategy meeting, available CIA documents provide no policy recommendations. However, they do contain assessments bearing directly on the policy issues discussed previously particularly with respect to enemy reactions to the measures contemplated. For example, intelligence estimates indicated little likelihood that intensified maritime operations would result in retaliation against GVN naval bases. Similarly, they predicted few serious consequences in response to U.S. limited tit-for-tat reprisal strikes. Rather, the CIA believed that -communist responses would be ,1 i mi ted to defensive measures, increased propaganda, and additional logistical assistance from China. In the event our reprisal actions were "heavier and sustained," the DRV was expected first to attempt to dissuade the United States through inter-national political moves, apparent concessions, and efforts to underline communist solidarity and determination. They would probably also curb the VC from making new provocative attacks "and might direct them to reduce temporarily the tempo and'size of their attacks." 152 41  .      CIA estimates of communist reaction to sys ema ' air attacks on North Vietnam were less certain.  hi e ac armed "substantial danger" that the DRV might decide to sen c forces on a large scale to Laos and South Vietnam, would or that the ("Hanoi might assume that United States be unwilling to undertake a major ground war, if it was, it could ultimately bedefeate V us methods which were successful against e e they thought it more likely that Hanoi would choose a more conservative course. They reasomed that "the DRV might calculate that it would be better to stop VC activity temporarily than risk loss of its military facilities and industry," but that they would make no meaningful con-cessions "such as agreeing to effective international inspection of infiltration routes." 153 In any event, the CIA did not believe that Chinese intervention was likely unless the United States should strike the Chinese mainland or unless U.S.GVN forces should attempt to "occupy areas of the DRV or communist-held territory in Northern laos. 15 1  It indicated that both North Vietnam and Communist China wished to avoid direct conflict with the United States and would probably "avoid actions that would in their view unduly increase the chances of a major U.S. response" against them. Rather than outright military victory in South Vietnam, CIA estimates indicated belief that the communists expected co gain contlol through a "neutralist coalition government dominated by pro-Communisu elements" that would come about "soon." This concern over the threat of neutralism had been voiced at the September meeting by Mr. McCone and was quite prevalent among intel1igence discussions of the period. Alto-getner, it created a rather gloomy impression of GV1I readiness to support sustained overt operations against North Vietnam and absorb likely VC countermeasures. In October the picture became even gloomier as a result o. an intelligence assessment which described continuing deterioration of the South Vietnamese political situation and predicted even more "...we believe that the conditions favor a further decay of GVN will and effectiveness. The 1 Y P of this decay will be increasing feXpation Sf possible leadership, friction with Americans, ep lines of political accommodation with then , ' a general petering, out of the war effo  42       TAB A       .  .

Therefore, in the interest of a thorough diseusslOn On February 20, the Coiu-mittee will make available ta your office a copy of the transcript of the testimony ot August C, 11)01, (Ambassador Stevenson's presentation is, Of course, a matter of public record.) 1 would hope that you will be able to review this transcript and bring the Committee up to date On what we new knmv of the Incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin. The Committee is particularly Interested in dis-cussing what lesions have been learned about the problems of analyzing in-formation in the midst of a crisis situation. Filially, as I mentioned to you during our conversation. I would like to renew my request Of January Sth that the Department of Defense provide the Committee at the earliest possible date with a report done by the Weapons System Evaluation Group cn the subject Command and Control of the Tonkin Gulf Incident, 4-3 August FR1." I look fOrward to seeing you cm February 20. Sincerely yours, J. W. Fci-buight, Chairman. The ChaIRmax. Mr. Secretary, my own view is that this statement, of yours should not be macle public until after the committee has had an opportunity to go through the hearings, and also to decide what it does about its own staff report and the hearings. This is an executive meeting. and 1 hope that you will be willing to retain that. I realize there will be pressures upon you, as there, arc upon the committee, for release of these documents, but 1 would think it is premature to do so. STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT S. McNAMARA, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE; ACCOMPANIED BY GEN. EARLE G. WHEELER, CHAIR-MAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, AND CAPT. H. B. SWEITZER, U.S. NAVY, MILITARY ASSISTANT TO THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF Secretary McNamara. Hr. Chairman, 1 very much appreciate your personal kind wishes and compliments. It has been a most satisfying 7 years to me, made more so by the courtesy with which I have been treated by this committee on my numerous occasions before it. I might also say I share T, S. Eliot's belief that history may be freedom, and I look forward to the development of our discussions here today in a way that will make it freedom and not servitude. I do have a statement which I would like to present to the committee at this time. I have not released it to the press. I told my associates that we should not do so. We have submitted to the committee some 200 copies of it So they may release it. I doubt very much that we will be able to withstand the pressures of the press today without releasing it. We have been deluged by requests for it. RELEASING OF DOCUMENTS Senator Monsr. Can I only say, Mr. Chairman, on a procedural matter, I quite agree with the Secretary. I clo not think we ought in any way to place any restrictions on the Secretary in regard to releasing anything he wants to release. I know you did not so imply. But I think the judgment of the Secretary should prevail in regard to what the Department of Defense releases, and 1 think the judgment of the committee should prevail in regard to what we should release    4 The Churmax". The only thing I was suggesting-------- Senator House. It is in keeping with the division of powers doctrine. The ChaIrmax. I thought it would be much fairer if we could arrange to release them simultaneously. For example, the staff report would present only one side of the picture, as would the Secretary's statement. I think it would be too bad if this goes out and nothing else. That is a matter for the committee to determine, I grant. Senator House. I still would not want toI would personally not 4 Paty to placing any restriction on the Secretary. 1 ie Chaikman. The point I am trying to make is that much of the information which we nave is confidential and cannot be released. U hereas a great many of the documents to which the Secretary refers, but docs not incorporate, are also confidential. I would submit that it ts a very one-sided picture to release only the statement. Senator Morse. It is one-sided only if the committee leaves it that way. The Chairman. I grant that. But it is only a matter of time. We have not- had a chance to read the Secretarys statement. We only received this statement an hour ago and it is a mutter of timing. Senator Mouse. I understand. The CmuitMAX, Does the Senator object for the committee to have tunc to consider the statement 1 Senator Mouse. I would only object as to placing any restrictions on the Secretary at all. The ChaIRmux. I do not consider it placing restrictions. It is a matter for us to arrive at. an understanding as to when we do it. Senator Gore. Hr. Chairman. The Chairman. Yes? Senator Gore. There is a question here. We are having an executive session. Could we not defer judgment on this until we have, had a chance to read it ?  The Chairman. That is what we normally do. That is what I was Suggesting, until we receive it; the committee makes up its own mind usually afterward, this afternoon, for example. Senator Gore. The point I was attempting to raise, I find a great Real of appeal in what Senator Morse has said, but I think it must be interpreted in the light of the fact that we are deaIing here with class-ined materials and having an executive hearing. The release of a Statement in executive, hearing, used in an executive hearing, has not, So far as I can recall, been done except by permission of the committee. 1 remember one time when I was chairman of a subcommittee, Secrotary Rusk was appearing, and the question of releasing his statement was submitted to the committee, and thc committee voted unanimously to approve its release. I dare say it might do sowe might do so, after hearing this, but I would like to defer judgment on it. The Chairman. That is all rightfrocedveal right of witness Senator House. Can I take 30 seconds more? I do not want to be a stickler or make a tempest in a teapot, but I do think, gentlemen, you are dealing here with a procedural matter that you should not set a precedent, on. I do not think that at any time a committee of the Congress has the right to call into executive session a Cabinet officer or any- I .     5 one who is really a spokesman for the administration and seek to hn-pose any restriction on that witness in regard to anything that he S,Om t .mt executive session in respect to Ins right to make any comment after the meeting is over or release any statement lie wants lo make, after the meeting is over. 1 . ing hypothetically, although the Secretary has made very clear ins willingness to oblige you, I am not talking about his willing-tcss. to oblige but. I am talking about what I consider to be a very, cty important, basic procedural right of the administration witness under the separation powers doctrine. I have never transgresged upon . Kitov uigly, and I am not goin to let the administration at any time upon our corresponding right under the same doctrine. un elore, 1 think we ought to deal with each other on thc basis that uc know what these respective rights are and seek to place no restriction on each other. That is my pointtf 1 16 sanic position, you will recall, in the MacArthur hearings ' ;fn twre was an attempt, in my judgment, on the part, of the com-co then to infringe the rights of the administration under the doc- t me there. I take the same position this morning. senator JIickexlooier. Mr. Chairmanino Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper. ltEsroxsnn.rrr for releasing a STATEsrEXT Senator IltCKENLoopEn. I think we have a rather complicated situ-on here which is not necessarily one under the control of thc Secre-<uv or of the committee. It may be more under the control of the committee than of the Secretary.  , . say that, the Secretary has no right whatsoever under our ptoeedure to release a transcript of this record where members cr t on the Secretary and answers come in. On the other hand, I would oay its, that the- responsibility of releasing a statement on thc sole respon- s mity 01 the Secretary or any oilier administrative official is thc responsibility of that ollieial of that department. I am not so sure wo can control it. We can control what wo release. I think it is a matter of sotno kind of an understanding. 1 am thoroughly sympathetic with what you have said, Mr. Chairman, about piecemeal releases of these things. I hate to read about them even though they have not been releasedI hate to read about them m lune magazine or the New York Times or other papers of that have to get some of our information from there. That makes us quite restless but apparently there is nothing we can do about it, and sometimes what goes on in this committee at least seems to be approximative in some of those news releases of certain columnists and so on. ues- mv So it is a problem that has its various facets. But so far as a straight statement of the Secretary " ' '  inhibit him from a straig otl his own responsibility what anyone else, hm e, I would say that we have no authority to ht statement ne wants to make to the public ,...-v without regard to questions or answers or what anyone else, has said, because when that occurs, then there is a dual responsibility there, not only on the questioner but the Secretary, and I hope we can control that. But I do not know; it is a very difficult thing, and I am thorouchly sympathetic with thc piecemeal .     75 The Chairman. I was not asserting any right to control it. It was merely a suggestion i f there was somecomity-Senator tncKEXLOOPER. If it is a question of comity, we can arrive at it. The CHAIRMAN. He can keep it within his control. Go ahead, Mr. Secretary. newsiaplt. REVortS of classifIed infobpiatIox Senator Lavschj. Mr. Chairman, having listened to what Senator Hickenlooper has just said, I feel obliged to make a statement that this body, vested with secret information of the most intimate character, dealing with the security of thc United States, has been brought scandalously into disrepute by the frequency with which reports are carried in the newspapers of what is supposed to be done under closed executive meetings, and I do nol feel content that we eat! wink at these leaks that are coming out of this committee. I am not satisfied with the statement thatthere is nothing we can do about it. Somebody is leaking things, whether it is a member. Members of the Senate, or whether it is members of thc stall'. I do not know who it is, but 11 is a terrible mistake that this body, related most intimately to matters that deal with the security of the United States, finds itself with newspapers reporting what takes place under confidential discussions. It cannot be denied that these reports are being carried outside of the meeting. How do they get out? I think we ought to make an investigation. tVc ought to find out. whether it is from thc start or where it emerges. The whole world can laugh at us at what happened, lt seems you do not need spies, al you have to do is look at the papers and fully you will find revealed what takes place confidentially in this room. The ChaIrmax. 1 wonder if we could get on with the testimony. Senator Aikkx. I wonk! like to observe that sometimes the leaks appear 2 or 3 days after they come out in the newspapers, which can hardly be in the category of a leak. The C-h-ukman. Let us get on. Senator Lausciie. The chairman wants to get on with this matter, and 1 can understand why lie would want to get on, but 1 will say to you with what you are trying to get on in not as significant as what I am trying to search out. Something is wrong with this committee. Senator ifonsn. Mr. Chairman. The Chahoiax. I wonder if we could proceed. Senator Clark. Let us go ahead. PLACING P.ESTItlcrlONS OX ADlnXISTRATIOx SPOKESMEN Senator llonsi We are not tIoinc to leave this record in this condi- tion so far -as tile Senator from Oregon is concerned. I go not t.nn.v ue ought to take un the Secretary? time with quarrels ol the committee, but, Frank, you were not here and you are nit avare oi what Senator Hickenlooper was talking about. We are not talking about what you arc talking about. That was not raised. I had men to the defence of what I think is a verv important doctrine that always ought to prevail at our hearings when we have a Cabinet officer or anyone cLc from the administration here namely, we should ma.ee no attempt to place      7 any restriction on the spokesman of thc administration regarding what he says to thc press afterward and what he releases. Thc only suggestion was a very helpful intention by the chairman suggesting that the Secretary of Defense hold any statement when he goes out of this meeting such as releasing the testimony he is about to give us tint il we will have the whole record considered. I only raised a point there, understanding the motivation of the chairman to ba of the highest, that I would not support placing any restriction, under the separation-of-powers doctrine, on Secretary McNamara. That is how all this occurred. We were not talking, Frank, about the problem that you are raising, and I do not think we ought to be taking the time of the Secretary to be talking about that now, That is for us to handle in our own executive session. Thc Chairmax. Mr. Secretary, will you go ahead. I think v.e ought to proceed. Senator Lavsciie. I want to make this statement, and then I will close. In the report that was filed by the staff, then was an addendum, and in the addendum there was stated that X contacted the staff and told about the truth that there were no missiles secn fired at our ships. I spoke to the stall. Well, as a member of the bench for 10 years,when you begin offering that type of proof to establish a fact, 1 simply cannot accept it. The Cuatrman. Proceed, Mr. Secretary. STAFF STUDY JJEFCSED Secretary HcXamara. Fir. Chairman, I have sought in my statement to be as responsive as I can to what T believe to be are the questions in the mind of the committee regarding the Tonkin Gulf incident. I have not had the advantage, however, or thc privilege of exposure to the staff study that I know has been completed and circulated among you. I asked for that several weeks ago but was denied access to it, and I may, therefore, not entirely respond to all of the information that you wish, to query me about, I will be very happy to take questions concerning the statement. Senator Mansfield. Do I understand the Secretary requested a copy of the study and was denied? Thc Chairpian. That is correct. I also requested their command and control documents and it was denied. Senator lEAXsrnmD. I was thinking of those in juxtaposition. The ChaIRMan. That is correct. Senator Gore. Perhaps we can exchange those'now. That might solve it. The Chatrmax. I think we ought to go on. Go on, Mr. Secretary. .Secretary McN-waka. Let me comment, Mr. Clmirnmn. These are not to be equated. You can have any raw material we have. We tried to supply all of it to you. Some of it "is very highly classified, and we assume you will treat it with thc care that its classification deserves. We also are quite willing to let you have evaluation reports, but only after we have ascertained that the authors of those reports had access to all the appropriate information. It turns out that the author of this particular study you mentioned did not have access. I never heard of the .     S study when you requested it. General Wheeler wis not aware of it. The author did not query General Wheeler or me about the actions wc took today, or the act ions of the Joint Chiefs, the National Security Council, or those the President took. I do not think you want evaluative reports sent over here that are incomplete. Any report we have, you have access to, but only after it has been properly reviewed as to its reliability. Your stafT study is quite a dill'erent matter. J consider it a very seri-ous handicap to me in appearing before yon today to address these issues that have been reviewed and addressed and considered in your stall' study, evidence of which is examined in your staff study, which evidence has never even been brought to niv attention, but if you are willing to go ahead with the hearing on that basis, I am. The ('iiaiumax. All of thc stall was based upon nmterial that came from your office, all of it. We gave you a complete list of every document and everything we had received, and it is available to you as it was to us. ADDENDU.M TO STAFF STUDY Secretary McNamara. Senator Lnusclte has just stated it had an addendum to it that included information that was not available to me. The Chairman. That was not used in the preparation of the stall study and it was purely an addendum of things that had happened out-side of the documents which came from the Pentagon. Senator Lauscije. I.et me say, Mr. Chairman, that the addendum recited a number of contacts made by a stallman with persons unknown. Now it was offered as an addendum supposedly ha vino; an insignificant importance, but it is there. Three or four men w.io were supposed to have been in the Tonkin Hay are alleged to have said that there were no missiles fired. Who are the men? Mow did they contact them? Senator Coofer. What weight was given to it ? Senator 31 .xsrtEr.r>. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for the interruption but I have to be up here on the floor. The Chairman. I would hope the Secretary would be allowed to proceed. Mr. Secretary? ESSENTIAL FACTS ARK THE SAME TODAY Secretary McXamaka. Mr. Chairman, on August 6, 1961.1 appeared before this committee and testified concerning the attacks in the Ion-kin Gulf on the destroyers U.S.S. Maddox and U.S.S. Turner Joy, and our response to those attaoks. Over 312 years have passed since that time. However, even with the advantage of hindshight, I find that the essential facts of the two attacks appear today as they did then, when they were fully explored with this committee and other Members of Congress. The relevant events, and their significance, were the subject of inten-sivc debate in the House and Senate. Both my testimony and that- of other officials of the Government reported the evidence that established conclusively the occurrenCC of these attacks on U.S. naval vessels operating in international waters. This evidence was available to us at the time of the decision to make a carefully tailored response to the .     9 attacks. In my testimony, I noted that, while sonar and radar read-ingS may be subject to interpretation and argume lt because of sea and atmospheric conditions, we had intelligence reports of a highly classified and unimpeachable nature which established, without question, that the attacks took place on both August 2 and August J. FART PLAYED DY U.S. NAVAL VESSELS Also fully explored at the time was the question whether the attacks on the Maddox and Turner Joy were' in any way provoked by or re-latcd to certain South Vietnamese naval activity which occurred in the period from July 30 to August 4. As I stated' then, and repeat now, our naval vessels played absolutely no part in, and were not associated with, this activity. There was then, and there is now, no question but that thc U.S. Government knew, and that I knew personally, thc gen-eral nature of some countermeasures being taken by the South Vietnamese in response to North Vietnams aggression. As I informed Congress, the boats utilized by the South Vietnamese were financed by thc United States. But I said then, and I repeat today, that the .Vaddox and the Turner Joy did not participate in the South Vietnamese activities, that they had no knowledge of the details of these operations, and that in no sense of the word could they be considered to have backstopped thc effort. 'As the chairman noted in the Senate debates, he was informed that our boats did not convoy or support or back up any South 1 ietnamesc naval vessels and that they were entirely unconnected or unasso-ciated with anv coastal forays the South Vietnamese themselves may have conducted." He was so informed and the information was com-pIetcly accurate. When thc South Vietnamese conducted the first of their two naval operations against North Vietnamese targets during this period, the Maddox patrol had not even begun and thc ship was at least 130 mtlea to the southeast. Thc attack on the Maddox on August 2 took place G3 hours after completion of tllis South Vietnamese naval operation. When the South Vietnamese boats conducted their second foray, the Maddox and the Turner Joy were at least 70 nautical miles to the northeast. Senator Case. I wonder if you could go a little more slowly. It is a little hard to understand. Secretary McNamara. Yes. The attack made against them on August 4 was almost a full day after this second South Vietnamese operation. The facts thus show today, as they showed 3 years ago, that attacks occurred against our ships both on August 2 and August 4, that we had available to us incontrovertible evidence of these attacks when the decision was marie to make our limited and measured response. and that these attacks were in no sense provoked or justified by any participation or association of our ships with South Vietnamese naval' operations. I would like briefly to review these facts with you. REVIEW OF FACTS OF ATTACK On the 2d of August 19G4, the U.S.S. Maddox was engaged in a patrol in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. At no time during the conduct of her patrol did Maddox depart from international      10 waters, or engage in any hostile act. Yet, while she was 2S miles from the coast of North Vietnam, on a course away from the coast, Maddox waS attacked by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats. At least three torpedoeS were directed by the boats at the Maddox, as well as machinegun fire. Thc Maddox avoided all torpedoes and. together with aircraft arriving on the scene from the U.S.S. 7 icondcroga, re-pelled the attack and sank or damaged the attacking craft. The attack on Maddox took place in daylight. North  letnamese reports of their plans had previously been obtained from an mteIh-gence source. The attacking craft were clearly seen by Maddox personnel and were photographed. The launching of the torpedoes by these PT boats was also observed aS were the torpedo wakes passing near Maddox. Machinegun fire from the attackers was also observed and, indeed, one bullet was recoveredit. is in our possession and I have it here this morning if you wish to inspect it.   This was an unprovoked attack on a ship of the L inted btates on the high seas. Nevertheless, no reprisal by the I nited States was undertaken. The Maddox, fortunately, had avoided significant dam-age itself, and inflicted damage on the attackers. Since no rational motive for the attack was apparent, we believed it possible that it had resulted from a miscalculation or an impulsive act of a local com-mander. .After the second attack, the chairman commented in Sen-ate debate that I had stated, after the first attack on the Maddox, that I did not expect it to be repeated. He also noted that this showed how wrong I was. On August 3, the day following, a note of protest was dispatched to the North Vietnam regime at the direction of the President. It concluded with the words' "The U.S. Government expects that the authorities of the regime in North Vietnam will be tinder no mis-apprehension as to the grave consequences which would, inevitably result from any further unprovoked offensive military action against U.S. forces." At thc same time, the President made public his instruc-tions to the Navy to continue and to add another destroyer to its patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin. It was within this context that we received, at about 920 Washington time on the morning of August 4. information from an intelligence source that North Vietnamese naval forces had been ordered to attack the patrol. Soon thereafter reports from the Maddox were received that the patrol was being approached by high speed surface radar contacts and that an attack appeared imminent. Other amplifying messages quickly followed and by about 11 a.m., we received a flash report that our destroyers, then located some 60 to Go miles from the coast of North Vietnam, were actually under attack. During this same time, intelligence sources reported that North Vietnamese vessels stated they had our ships under attack. Throughout thc remainder of the morning and cany afternoon, flash message reports of the engagement, some ambiguous and some conflicting, continued to pour in. Frequent telephone contact was maintained with the commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, Hawaii. The President was kept informed of these developments.      11 cONTRADIcrIONS EXAMINED AND KECOXCILKD During this period, I had a series of meetings with my chief civilian and military advisers in which the apparent ambiguities and contradictions in the reports were examined and reconciled to our satisfaction. We identified and refined various options for a response to thc attack, to be presented to the President. Among these options was the air strike against the attacking boats and their associated bases, which option was eventually selected. As the options were iden-tified, preliminary messages were sent to appropriate operational Commanders alerting them to the several possibilities so that initial plan-ningsteps cpuld be undertaken. In the early afternoon, the National Security Council met, at which time we briefed thc participants, including the President, on thc available details of the attack. Shortly thereafter, having received the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Stall', we recommended to thc Pres-ident, and he approved, a response Consisting of an rnr strike on the Pi' and Sv.atow boat bases and their associated facilities. During all of this time, the mcssage reports of the engagement trom the ships, plus other information of a verv highly classified nature received dur-mg the attack, were being reviewed to eliminate any doubt that an at I ack on the destroyers in fact occured. For example, J saw a message from the onscene task group com-mantler which expressed doubts as to the validity of many of the sonar reports. 1 discussed this message by telephone with the commander in chief, Pacific, and informed him that, although we would continue with the preparations, the reprisal strike would not be executed until we were absolutely positive of the attack. He of course agreed and in a later telephone call informed me that he was satisfied, from all thc reports he had on hand, that an attack on our ships had taken place. Final!v, at about 630 p.m., Washington time, the message to execute the strike was transmitted by the Commander in chief, Pacific. Those are the essential details. To recapitulate, on August 2, one of our destroyers was attacked by North Vietnamese naval forces without provocation while on patrol on the high seas. Since the cle-stroycr had suffered no damage and had repulsed and damaged her attackers, and since the possibility seemed to exist that the incident was an isolated act, no further military response was made. North Vietnam was warned the next day, however, of the "grave consequences which would inevitably follow another such attack. Furthermore, the President announced that the patrol would continue and would consist of two destroyers. The next night, the two destroyers were also attacked without provocation on tnc high seas by North Vietnamese naval forces. When these facts were established to thecomplete satisfaction of all responsible authorities, we responded with an air strike on the facilities whi ;h supported the attacking vessels. 90-18765----2 .     12 accuracy OF DETAILS STILL QUESTIONED Now, three and a half years Inter, there again seems to be debate about, the essential accuracy of the above account. The questions that appear now to be raised are the same as those considered and settled at the time lfas the patrol in fact for legitimate purposes? lt ere the attacks unprovoked? Was there indeed a second at tack ?. If there was a second attack, was there Sufficient evidence available at the time of our response to support tins conclusion? I would like to address these questions. was ruarosE or Patrol LEGITIMATE? First, was the patrol in fact for legitimate purposes? 1 atrols of the nature of those carried on by Maddox and Turner Joy were initiated Jn the western Pacific in 19G2. They were carried out in international waters along the coastlines of Communist countries m that area. They were open patrols and no hostile actions were ever taken by the U.S. forces involved. Provocative actions were avoided. The purpose was to learn what we Could of military activity and environmental conditions in these parts of the world, operating tn waters where we had every legal right to bo. The primary purpose of the Maddox was to observe"Xorth Vietnamese naval activity in those waters, in view of thc evidence we had of infiltration by sea by North 1 ictnam into South Vietnam. Other secondary purposes were area familiarization and observation by visual and electronic means of any other activity of military intereSt. We had the undisputed right to do this. In view of our assistance to South Vietnam, such observations were needed. The suggestion has appeared incidentally that because Maddox, prior to Commencement of its patrol, took abroad certain communications equipment, with personnel to operate this equipment, its patrol had Some different and presumably more sinister purpose than others which had preceded it. This is simply not. true. The mission of obserra-tion which I have outlined was to be fulfilled with the regularly installed equipment of the ships. The extra equipment brought abroad Maddox consisted in essence of standard shipboard radio receivers added to the ships normal complement of such receivers in order to give an added capability for detecting indications of a possible hostile attack on the patrol. ' . Thc Congress, at the time of the debates on the Tonkin Gulf resoIu-tton, was aware that visual and electronic surveillance of the area was one of the purposes served by the De Soto patrol. Any suggestion now that the installation of passive radio receiving equipment changed tho essential nature of the patrol is unwarranted. I might add that virtually all of the De Soto patrols, since their commencement in 1962, had been outfitted w.th similar equipment- for , the same primarily defensive purposes. WERE THE ATTACKS UNPROVOKED? Second, were the attacks unprovoked? Senator IEvxdt. Are you defining the De Soto patrol ? .     13 Secretary McNamara. The term as I am using it here refers to the patrols in the Tonkin Gulf of which this was the fourth, one having occurred in 1962, one in 1903, and the. third in the early part of 19G4, and the fourth in August 1961. Actually it is a generic term covering a broader range of patrols in the western Pacific but as used in this paper it refers to the four patrols in the Tonkin Gulf. Second, were the attacks unprovoked ? . I have heard it suggested that the patrol provoked the attacks by intruding into thc territorial waters of North Vietnam. The facts, I think, are these. Prior to the first attack, on August 2, the Maddox had been engaged on its patrol since July 31. At no time during the conduct of this patrol did the Maddox depart from international waters. It had been in-structcd to. approach the North Vietnamese coastline no closer than S lnles and any oftsltore island no closer than 4 nautical miles. Maddox adhered scrupulously to these instructions. When thc patrol resumed with Maddox and Turner Joy, the ships were instructed to remain at least II miles from the coast. These instructions also were followed. The United States recognizes no claim of a territorial sea in excess of 3 miles. This consistent position of the United States was reemphasized at the close of the 1060 Convention on Law of the Sea ni Geneva. bore have, however, been statements reported in the press that the ox entered into waters claimed by Xorth Vietnam as territorial, inrC m aUnients have no basis in fact. At no time prior to the August 1964 ionkin Gulf incidents did the North Vietnamese Government cIann a width of territorial sea in cxcess of 3 miles. The North Vietnamese Government Succeeded the French Government, which adhered m the 3-mile limit. Under the rules of international law, no claim by 1 orth  ietnam in excess of 3 miles would be assumed unless specifically made and published. It should be noted that. Cambodia, a sister suc-Cessor state, publicly adopted the French 3-mile rule on achieving independence. Later, it proclaimed a 5-mile limit. South Vietnam clauns 3 miles. The first statement of North Vietnam which approaches a claim tn excess of 3 miles occurred well after the attacks on Septcm-ber 1. 196-1, in the form of a broadcast from Radio Hanoi in which it was stated, The Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared that the territorial sea is 12 miles." No offieial documentary confirmation of the claim asserted in this broadcast is known to exist. In short at not time during thc patrol did either of thc destroyers eate the high seas and enter areas claimed by the North Vietnamese r recognized by the United States as national waters. 10 Question might be asked, however Should not we as a practical matter have assumed a claim of 12 miles since this is the uniform position of the Communist countries? The simple answer is that Communist countries do not have such a uniform position Cuba and 1 omnd eaUl adhere to the traditional 3-mile limit while Yugoslavia and Albania claim 10 miles. south VIETXAJIESE OPERATIONS on the Tonkin Gulf resolution and the healings Another point relating to provocation" wasdtscussed and dtapnsed of during the debates A Eukiu Gui. nwoou,.. ...v prior thereto, but, of late, it scorns to have been resurrected, it is ttio .     14 suggestion that our patrol was in some way connected with certain reconnaissance and bombardment activities of South Vietnamese patrol cruft against North Vietnamese. 1 mfonned members of this committee of these activities of the South 1 ietnamese in an informal meeting on August 3,11)61, after the attack on the Maddox. The subject was again raised in lesser detail in my testimony before this committee on August G, 1961. I pointed out that these raids were a legitimate attempt by the South Vietnamese to Counter and retaliate against thc systematic infiltration of their cotin-try by sea which had been carried out by North Vietnam for the previous two and a half years. 1 described the scope of that infiltration; that is, 140 known incidents between July and December 1961, an estimated 1,400 infiltrators having been landed in South Vietnam during thattime. At ith respect to the legitimacy of those South Vietnamese operations, you, Air. Chairman, stated during the Tonkin Gulf Hoor debates ide boats thnt may have struck at the -n -tai areas of North Vietnam may nate been supplied by u-. We have'been helping .South Vietnam ami itself. I do not knew about the specific beats. r I personally think Ulis is a perfectly legitimate and proper way to defend oneself from the kind of aggression South Vietnam has been Subjected to for years. Senator Morse, at the hearing on August 6, specifically raised the question of a connection between our patrol and 1 lie South Vietnamese bombardment of two North Vietnamese islanclS which had occurred some two and a half days prior to the attack on Maddox, and I rc-sponded that there was no connection. The two operations were separate and distinct. I informed you that our destroyers took no part whatsoever in the South Vietnamese! operation. They did not convoy, support, or back up thc South Vietnamese boats in any way. As' Stated during thc hearings  ... as 1 reported to you earlier this week, we understand that the Suuth sea Oree carried out patrol aetiOn around these Islands and actually -net.cd the points they felt were assOciated with this infiltration. t>ur ships had absolutely 110 knowledge of it. were not connected with it; in no sense or the word can be considered to have backstopped the eb'ort. That statement remains entirely accurate. I can confirm today that neither the ship commanders nor (ho embarked task group commander had any knowledge of the South Vietnamese action against the two islands or of any other spccifiC South Vietnamese operations against the North. Higher naval commands were made aware of the operations by Commander, U.S. Military .Assistance Command, Vietnam, tn order to avoid mutual interference or confusion botween our patrols and those operations' DIRECTIOXS TO U.S. DESTKOTEItS Throughout the patrol conducted first by the Maddox alone and later by the Maddox and thc Turner Joy, U.S. destroyers were directed to remain in waters which would keep them from bccomino-operationally involved with the South Vietnamese activity. Thc strictions this imposed on the patrol were such that, at one time, con-sidcralion was given to its abandonment. The task group commander ' knew only that certain South Vietnamese naval operations were periodically carried on in the area. He had no detailed knowledge o      i 15 of their typa or of where or when they would be conducted. Indeed, his lack of knowledge was such that he mistakenly identified the South  ietnamese craft returning from their operation of July 31 as somet P-G class boats. Bn Pu1e of fact, our patrols and the shore bombardments by South  ietnamese forces were separated in both time and space. When South  lennunese P I Fs bombarded the islands of lion Nieu and lion lie on the night of July 30-31, the Maddox had not oven commenced her patrol, and was at least 130 miles to the southeast of the nearest of f ,e Jhuub.At the time of the attack-on the Maddox on August the South 1 ietnamese boats had been back at their base in Da Nang for almost 33 hours. I learned subsequent to my testimony of August 6, 1961, that an-other South 1 ietnamese bombardment took place on the night of -August 3-4. At the time of that action, the Maddox and Turner Joy were at least 70 mi Ies to the northeast. The North Vietnamese attack on Maddox and Turner Joy on thc night of August 4 occurred some 22 hours later. I think it important, too, in dealing with this issue, to recall that the 1 resident had announced publicly on August 3 that our patrol would, continue and consist of two destroyers. It is difficult to be-)e m the face of that announcement, and its obvious purpose of asserting our right to freedom of the seas, that even the North Viet-namese could conneCt the patrol of thc Maddox and Turner Joy with a South Vietnamese action taking place some 70 miles away. WAS THERE A SECOXD ATTACK' Now, thirdly, was there indeed a second attack? 1 know of no claim that the attack on Maddox on August 2 did not occur. As for the second attack, the incident occurred on a very dark, moonless, overcast night. As would be expected under these conditions, some uncertainty existed, and to this day exists, about some of the precise details of the at I ack. But there should be no uncertainty about the tact that an attack took place. The evidence pertaining to the incident is reviewed in the following paragraphs. noo16 evenW f August -1, 106-1, Task Group 72,1 consisting of lU'mSi oddox and U.S.S. Turner Joy. with COMDESDIV 192 cm-barked m Maddox and acting as CTG 72.1, was proceeding on an easterly course in thc Gulf of Tonkin at a speed of 20 knots. At about tr J".1'1" "Bin Gulf time.' the task group Commander, Capt. J. J. Herrick, USX, observed cm thc surface search radar nt least five con-tacts, which he evaluated as probable torpedo boats, located about 03 mues to the northeast- of thc two ships. At 746 p.m., Maddox and Turner Joy Changed course to 130 and increased speed to 28 knots to avoid what the task group commander had evaluated as a trap. Shortly after 9 p.m., both ships' radars held contacts approximately 14 miles to the east. These contacts were on course 1G0, speed 30 knots. At chat tune the two U.S. ships were approximately 60 miles from the north 1 ietnamese coast. At about 9 MO p.m.. both Maddox and Turner Joy opened fire on the approaching craft when it was evident from their maneuvers that they 1 To convert local Tonktn Gult ttue to e.d.t. subtract 12 hours.  Section 3 3    16 were pressing in for attack positions. At about this time, the boats were at a range of 0,000 yards from Maddox when the radar trucking indt-cated that the contact had tinned away and begun to open in range. Torpedo noises were then heard by the Maddox's sonar. A report of the torpedo noise was immediately passed to the Turner -Joy by intership radio and both ships took evasive action to avoid the torpedo. REPORTS OF EYEWITNESSES A torpedo wake was then sighted passing abeam Turner Joy from aft to forward, approximately 300 feet to port on the same bearing as that reported by Maddox. This sighting was made bv at least four of Turner Joy's topside personnel 7he forward gun director officer, Lt. (jg.) John J. Barry, USNR; the port lookout, Edwin R. Sentel, SN, USN; by a seaman who was in the forward gun director with the director oflicer, Larry O. Litton, SN, USX and by a seaman who was oporator of the after gun director, Roger N. Bergland, SN, USX.  At about 1024 p.m., one target was taken under fire by Turner Joy. Numerous hits were observed on this target and it disappeared from all radars. The commanding officer and other Turner Joy personnel ob-sorved a 1 hick column of black smoke from this target. Later, 1047 p.m., during the attack a searchlight was observed by all signal bridge and maneuvering bricUe personnel including the commanding officer of U.S.S. Turner Joy. The beam of the searchlight did not touch the ship, but was scon to Swing in an arc toward Turner Joy and was immediately extinguished when aircraft from the combat air patrol orbiting above tlfc ships approached the vicinity of the searchlight. (Walter L. Shishim, QIECS. USX; Richard B. Johnson, Slfl, USX; Richard D. Nooks, Q1I 3. USN Richard FL Bncino, SMS, USX; and Gary D. Carroll, SM3, USX, stationed on thc Turner Joy's Signal bridge all made written statements that they Sighted the searchlight.) The silhouette of an attacking boat was seen by at least four Turner Joy personnel when the boat came between the flares dropped by an aircraft and the ship. When these four men were asked to sketch what they had seen, they accurately sketched PLtype boats. (None of the four had ever seen a picture of a P1 boat, before). (Donald V. Sharkey, BMojUSN; Kenneth E. Garrison. SN.USN Delner Jones, GMG SN, USX, and Arthur B. Anderson, FT SN, USN, are the four personnel from the Turner Joy who sighted the boat.) In addition to the above, a gunner's mate second class stationed aft of the signal bridge aboard U.S.S. Maddox saw the outline of a boat, which was silhouetted by the light of a burst from the 3-inch projectile fired at it. (Jose R. San Augustin G1IGS, USN.) The commanding officer of Attack Squadron 52 from thc Ticonderoga (Comdr. G. II. Edmondson. USN) and his wingman (Lt. J. A. hu.rvn)> "hilc flying at altitudcS of between 700 and 1.500 feet in the vtc.nitv of the two destroyers at the time of thc torpedo attack both sighted gun flashes on the surface of thc water as well as light antiaircraft bursts at their approximate altitude. On one pass over the two destroyers, both pilots positively sighted a snakey high speed wake DA miles ahead of the lead destroyer, U.S.S. Maddox. " Two U.S. Marine Corps personnel who were manning machineguns on U.S.S. Maddox saw lights pass up the port side of the ship, go out .     17 a4mul, and pass down the starboard side. Their written statement asserts their belief that this was one or more small boats at high speed. LCpi "usoc ) he'v BAllasrcSGT USMC> and David A ProutI, INTELLIGENCE REFOKTS i to the above, intelligence reports received from a highly classified and unimpeachable source reported that North Vietnam was making preparations to attack our destroyers with two Swatow boats and w ith one 1 1 boat if the PT could-be made ready in time. The same fiUlCR reP01ted, while the engagement was in progress on August 4, that the attack was underway. Immediately after the attack ended, the soutco reported that the North Vietnamese lost two ships in the engagement.  No one. within the Department of Defense has reviewed all of this m onnatlon without arriving at the unqualified conclusion that a deter-mtned attack was made on the Maddox and Turner Joy in the Tonkin Udi 0,1 f4e maht of August 4, 1964. Vice Adm. Roy L. Johnson, IO- , commander of the U.S. 7th Kleet at the time, stated in his te lew oi the combined chronology and track charts submitted bv the task group commander ' Tinn'.r To1?) Fleet, is convinced beyond nny doubt that Maddox mid of J An- Vnot suN<mted to an unprovoked surface torpedo attack on the night  HoiSl 1UUI. Adm. 1 IE. Moorer, then commander in chief, Pacific Fleet, concurred in that appraisal. Ini 1) ashington, thc Director of the Joint Staff, Lt. Gen. David A. ulcmnaI USAF, analyzed the incoming information from message .. me, with the assistance of the Joint Staff. He then gave his evalua-collfivmed Secretary f Defense "The actuality of the attack is ,, 4? ace of this evidence, I can only conclude that many of 1 1 .1"13Jent questions as to whether or nofan attack took place must IV e s'hm1 h'om confusion between thc August 4 attack and an. It nt?K!ent fhich occurred on the lSth of September 1964; that is, r;1. v < aI3 later. At that time, the U.S. destroyers Morton and ( were patrolling, at night, in the Gulf of Tonkin, and initially cported theinselves under attack. While the ensuing situation reports cl cated the probability of hostile craft in the area of the patrol, n ?'a" decided at both thc Washinctoii and field command levels ;n. evidence of an attacIfexisted. It should be noted that r n i ib&ence source that confirmed the attacks of August 2 and 4 t tried no evidence of any enemy action on September 1S. In view ? ron.t unresolved doubts, no retaliatory" action was taken. Many itc n tcluaIs u ho were not aware of all of the facts about all three LS t "ttis, August 2 and 4, and September 18, have made the staken assumption that descriptions of the September 1S incident to second Tonkin Gulf incident.

As a final point on this issue, U.S. naval forces in the 314 years which have elapsed since the August 1961 incidents have captured several North A ietnamese naval personnel These personnel were extensively interrogated. One of these, captured in July 19G6, stated he had taken part in the Augu-r 2, 19G1, attack on the SJaddox, and his account of that attack coincided with our observations. Ife professed no knowledge of the August 4 attack and said that he believed that PT boats were not involved in that attack. He stated that Swatows could have been used for that attack. His disclaimer of PT participation is contradicted by information reCaived from a later captive. A North Viet-natnese naval officer captured in -Inly 1967 provided the name of the commander of a PT squadron. In intelligence reports received inune-diately after the August 4 attack, this Commander and his squadron were identified by name and number as participants. ScrFXciF.XT EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO SuPPOIST C0NCLVSI0X Now, finally, jf there was a second attack, was there sufficient evi-dencc available at the time of our response to support this conclusion ? Some of the details cited above, particularly the statements of eyewitnesses, although gathered immediately after the attack, had not reached Washington at the time that the reprisal air strikes were ordered executed. Sufficient informationn was in the hands of te President, however, to establish beyond any doubt then nr now that an attack had taken place. Allow m? to repoat again that information An intolIifrer.ee report of a IiighIv classified and unimpeachable nature received shortly before the engagement, stating that North Viet. narnese imval forces intended to attack the Maddox and Turner Joy. Reports from the ships that their radars indicated they were being shadowed by high speed surface vessels. Reports from thc ships that they were being approached by the lugh speed vessels and an attack appeared imminent. Reports from the ships that they were under attack. A report from the ships that searchlight illumination had been utilized by the attacking craft and that gunfire against the patrol had been observed. A report that two torpedoes had passed close to the Turner Joy and that there had been positive visual sightings of what appeared to be cockpit lights of patrol craft passing near the Maddox. An intelligence report stating that North Vietnamese naval forces had reported that thev were involved in an engagement. Reports from the U.S. ships that, they had sunk two and possibly three of the attacking craft. An intelligence report statin" that North Vietnamese naval forces had reported losing two ships in thc engagement. A report from the onscene task group commander that he was Certain that the ambush had taken place, although precise details of the engagement were still not known. A report from the commander in chief, Pacific, that he had no doubt that an attack had occurred. All of this inforinatinn was available prior tn the time the Executive order was issued.      19 MOXSTKOUS IXSINVAT10XS As a final point, 1 must address thc suggestion that, in some way, the Government of the United States induced the incident on August 4 with the intent of providing an excuse to take the retaliatory, act ton which wo in fact took. I can only characterize .-itch insinuations as monstrous. 1 he eflectivc repulsion of the August 2 attack on the JWm with relatlvely high cost to the small North Vietnamese Navy, coupled with cur protest which clearly and unequivocally warned of the serious con-sequenees of a recurrence, made us confident that another attack was unlikely. The published order of thc President that the destroyers should continue to assert the right of the freedom of the seas in the Gull of Tonkin, and setting forth the composition of the patrol, should have served to avoid any further misunderstanding. As the patrol rc-siuned the ships were ordered to remain 11 miles from the coastline in lieu of the S miles ordered on thc previous patrols, hardly indicative ?ta.11 intent to induce another attack. As a matter of fact, on their own initiative the two ships approached the coastline no closer than 1G miles during their patrol. But beyond that, I find it inconceivable that anyono even remoteIy familiar with our soeietv and sr-stem of Gov-ernment could suspect the existence of a conspiracy which would in-ude almost, if not all, the entire chain of military command in the . acme, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StnlL the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense, and his chief civilian assistants, the Secre-ai) -te> the President of the United States. lr. Chairman, that concludes my statement, and I will be very Jmp-Pt.0 1 answer any questions. lhe Chaiumax. Thankyou, Mr. Secretary. 1 would like to have a few preIimiimry questions with regard to the situation under which this whole affair took place. I don't think they are very difficult to answer. INTERNAL TROUBLES OF KHAXtl C0VERX1IEXT Mr. Secretary, is it true that the government of General Khanh which overthrew the Minh junta in January 1961 was in serious trou-ble by the spring and early summer of 19611 .
