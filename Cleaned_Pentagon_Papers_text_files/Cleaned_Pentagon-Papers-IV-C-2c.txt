X- 0295 K FR 1       SUMMARY ANALYSIS       MILITARY PRESSURES AGAINST NVN NOVEMBERDECEMBER 1964 SUMMARY and ANALYSIS In the late fall of 1964, President Johnson made a tentative decision in favor of limited military pressures against North Vietnam. He actd on the consensus recommendation of his principal advisors, a consensus achieved by a process of compromising alternatives into a lowest-common-denominator proposal at the sub-cabinet and cabinet level, thereby precluding any real Presidential choice among viable options. The choices he was given a included greater pressures against North Vietnam. The Presidentra ecision itself was for a limited and tightly controlled two-step build-up 01 pressures. The first phase involved an intensification of existing harassment activities with reprisals; the second, which was approved in principle only, was to e a sustained, slowly escalating air campaign a.gainst the North. The spec rum of choice could have run from (a) a judgment that the situation in the out was irretrievable and, hence, a decision to begin the withdrawal o. U.S. forces; to (b) a judgment that the maintenance of a non-communist South . Vietnam was indispensable to U.S. strategic interests and, therefore, required a massive U.S. intensification of the war both in the Nor ch and in tne ou . The extreme withdrawal option was rejected almost without surfacing or consideration since it was in direct conflict with the independentnon-communist SVN commitments of NSAM 288. The opposite option of massive involve-ment,which was essentially the JCS recommendation at an early point in nee deliberations, was shunted aside because both its risks and costs were 00 high. Short of those extremes, however, were two other alternatives chat were briefly considered by the Working Group as fallback positions but rejected before they were fully explored. While both came into some con-flict with the commitments to South Vietnam of NSAM 288, they could ave been justified as flowing from another long-standing U.S. convictlon, namely that ultimately the war would have to be won in the South by t e. South Vietnamese. These fallback positions were outlined in the following manner "1. To hold the situation together as long as possible so that we have time to strengthen other areas of Asia. "2. To take forceful enough measures in the situation so that we' emerge from it, even in the worst case, with our standing as the principal helper against Communist expan-sion as little impaired as possible. "3. To make clear...to nations, in Asia particularly, that, failure in South Vietnam, if it comes, was due to special local factors that do not apply to other nations we are committed to defend"  .      In operational terms the first would have meant holding the lineplacing an immediate, low ceiling on the number of U.S, personnel in SVN, and taking vigorous efforts to build on a stronger base elsewhere, possibly Thailand. The second alternative would have been to undertake some spectacular, highly visible supporting action like a limited-duration selective bombing campaign as a last effort to save the South; to have accompanied it with a propaganda campaign about the unwinnability of the war given the GVNs ineptness and; then, to have sought negotiations through compromise and neutralization vzhen the bombing failed. Neither of these options was ever developed. The recommendation of the Principals to the President left a gap between the maximum objective of NSAM 288 and the marginal pressures against the North being proposed to achieve that objective. There are two by no means contradictory explanations of this gap. One explanation is the way in which pressures and the controlled use of force were viewed by the Principals. There is some reason to believe that the Principals thought that carefully calculated doses of force could bring about predictable and desirable responses from Hanoi. The threat implicit in minimum but increasing amounts of force ("slow squeeze") would, it was hoped by some, ultimately bring HanoT to the table on terms favorable to the U.S. Underlying this optimistic view was a significant underestimate of the level of the DRV commitment to victory in the South, and an overestimate of the effectiveness of U.S. pressures in weakening that resolve. The assumption was that the threat value of limited pressures coupled with declarations of firm resolve on our part would be sufficient to force the DRV into major concessions. Therefore, the U.S. negotiating posture could  be a tough one. Another factor which, no doubt, commended the proposal to the Administration was the relatively low-cost--in political termsof such action. Furthermore, these limited measures would give the GVN a temporary breathing spell, it was thought, in which to regroup itself, both politically and militarily should stronger action involving a direct confrontation between the two Vietnams be required at some future date. And lastly, it was the widely shared belief that the recommendation was a moderate solution that did not foreclose future options for the President if the measures did not fully achieve their intended results. The JCS differed from this view on the grounds that if we were really interested in affecting Hanois will, we would have to hit hard at its capabilities. A second explanation of the ga.p between ends and means is a more simple one. In a phrase, we had run out of alternatives other than pressures. The GVN was not reforming, ARVN was being hit hard, further U.S. aid and advice did not seem to do the trick, and something was needed to keep the GVN afloat until we were ready to decide on further actions at a later date. Bombing the North would fit that bill, and make it look like we tried.  .      The President was cautious and equivocal in approaching the decision. Indicative of his reluctance to widen the U.S. commitment and of his desire to hedge his bets was the decision to make phase II of the new policy contingent on GVN reform and improvement. Ambassador Taylor was sent back to Saigon in December after the White House meetings with the understanding that the U.S. Government did not believe "that we should incur the risks which are inherent in any expansion of hostilities without first assuring that there is a government in Saigon capable of handling the serious problems involved in such an expansion and of exploiting the favorable effects which may be anticipated" As with the discussions of the preceding six months, the decisions at the end of 1964 marked another step in the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The following is a summary of the NovemberDecember, 1964 and January, 1965 deliberations. On the eve of the November election, and after the decision not to retaliate against the North for the VC attack on the Bien Hoa airbase on November 1, the President appointed an inter-agency working group and asked it to conduct a thorough re-examination of our Vietnam policy and to present him with alternatives and recommendations as to our future course of action. That such a review should have been undertaken so soon after the policy deliberations and decisions of September is at first glance surprising. The President, however, was now being elected in his own right with an overwhelming mandate and all the sense of opportunity and freedom to recon-sider past policy and current trends that such a victory invariably brings. In retrospect, there appears to have been, in fact, remarkably little lati-tude for reopening the basic questions about U.S. involvement in the Vietnam struggle. NSAM 288 did not seem open to question. In Vietnam, our now sub-stantial efforts and our public affirmation of resolve to see the war through to success had failed to reverse either the adverse trend of the war or the continuing deterioration of South Vietnamese political life. The September deliberations had produced only a decision against precipitate action and had done nothing to redress the situation. Significantly, however, they had revealed the existence of an Administration consensus that military pressures against the North would be required at some proximate future date for a variety of reasons. Now, in November, with a new electoral mandate and the abundant evidence of the inadequacy of current measures, the President was once again looking for new ideas and proposalsa low-cost option with prospects for speedy, positive results. The Working Group's first job had been to examine U.S. interests and objectives in South Vietnam. This subject stirred some of the most heated debate of the entire Working Group project. At the outset, the maximum statement of U.S. interests and objectives in South Vietnam was accompanied by two fallback positions--the first a compromise, the second merely rational-izations for withdrawal. The JCS representative took testy exception to        including the fallback positions in the Groups paper and cited JCS Memoranda on the critical importance of South Vietnam to the U.S. position in Asia. His forceful objections were effective and they were downgraded in the final paper which, while also pointedly rejecting the "domino theory" as over-simplified, nevertheless, went on to describe the effect of the fall of South Vietnam in much the same terms. Specifically pointing up the danger to the other Southeast Asian countries and to Asia in general, the paper concluded "There is a great deal we could still do to reassure these countries, but the picture of a defense line clearly breached could have serious effects and could easily, over time, tend to unravel the whole Pacific and South Asian defense structures." In spite of these concessions, the JCS refused to associate itself with the final formulation of interests and objectives, holding that the domino -theory was perfectly appropriate to the South Vietnamese situation. One of the other important tasks assigned to the Working Group was the intelligence assessment of the. effectiveness of measures against the North in improving the situation in the South. The initial appraisal of the intelligence community was that "the basic elements of Communist strength in South Vietnam remain indigenous," and that "even if severely damaged" the DRV could continue to support a reduced level of VC activity. While bombing might reduce somewhat the level of support for the VC and give the GVN a respite, there was very little likelihood that it would break the will of Hanoi. The estimate was that Hanoi was confident of greater staying power than the U.S. in a contest of attrition. These views were challenged by the JCS member who stressed that the military damage'of air strikes would appreciably degrade DRV and VC capabilities. In deference to this view, the final Working Group estimate gave greater emphasis to the military effective-ness of strikes, although it was pessimistic about the extent of damage the DRV leaders would be willing to incur before reconsidering their objectives. It concluded with the assessment that there was very little likelihood of either Chinese or Soviet intervention on behalf of the DRV if pressures were adopted by the U.S. As the Working Group toiled through November in its effort to develop options, it focused on three alternative courses of action. Option A was essentially a continuation of military and naval actions currently underway or authorized in the September decisions, including prompt reprisals against the North for attacks on U.S. forces and VC "spectaculars". It also included a resistance to negotiations until the North had agreed in advance to our conditions. Option B augmented current policies with systematic, sustained military pressures against the North and a resistance to negoti-afions unless we could carry them on while continuing the bombing. Option C proposed only a modest campaign against the North as compared with option B iv  .      and was designed to bring the DRV to the negotiating table. If that . occurred the pressures were to be suspendedalthough with the threat of resumption should negotiations break down. In the course of the month, these options converged and the distinctions between them blurred. In particular, option A was expanded to include some low-level pressures against the North; the negotiations element of option B was, in effect, dropped and the pressures were to be applied at a faster, less flexible pace; and option C was stiffened to resemble the first incarnation of option Bthe pressures would be stronger and the negotiating position tougher. Thus, by the end of the month when the working Group's proposals were presented to the NSC Principals for consideration before a recommendation was made to the President, all options included pressures against the North, and, in effect, excluded negotiations in the short-run, since the terms and pre-conditions proposed in all three options were entirely unrealistic. The policy climate in Washington simply was not receptive to any suggestion that U.S. goals might have to be compromised. And, in proposing pressures against the North, the Working Group was conscious of the danger that they might generate compelling world-wide pressure on the U.S. for negotiations. How large a role the specific perception of the President's views, validated or unvalidated, may have played in the Working Groupls narrowing of the options is not clear. It seems likely, however, that some guidance from the white House was being received. During the last week in November, the NSC Principals met to consider the Working Group's proposals. They were joined on November 27 by Ambassador Taylor. Taylors report on conditions in South Vietnam was extremely bleak. To improve South Vietnamese morale and confidence, and to "drive the DRV out of its reinforcing role and obtain its cooperation in bringing an end to the Viet Cong insurgency," he urged that military pressures against the North be adopted. His report had a considerable impact on the Principals and later on the President. As the discussions continued through the several meetings of that week, opinion began to converge in favor of some combination of an "extended option A" and the first measures against the North of option C. In the end, the Principals decided on a two-phase recommendation to the President. Phase I would be merely an extension of current actions with some increased air activity by the U.S. in Laos and tit-for-tat reprisals for VC attacks on U.S. forces or other major incidents. During this period, the GVN would be informed of our desires for its reform and when these were well underway, phase II, a campaign of gradually escalating air strikes against the North, would begin. This proposal, was presented to the President on December 1. He approved phase I and gave assent, at least in prin-clple, to phase II. In approving these measures, the President appears to have been reluctant to grant final authorization for phase II until he felt it was absolutely necessary. v  .      If a consensus was reached within the Administration in favor of mili-tary pressures against the North, it certainly re-leched no commonly held rationale for such action. Generally speaking the military (MACV, -ILCPAC, JCS) favored a strong campaign against the North to interdict the infiltra-tion routes, to destroy the overall capacity of the Norch to support e insurgency, and to destroy the DRVs will to continue support of the Viet Cong. The State Department (with the exception of George Ball) and t e . civilian advisors to Secretary McNamara favored a gradually mounting series of pressures that would place the North in a slow squeeze and act as both carrot and stick to settling the war on our terms. .As would be expecte , State was also concerned with the international political implications o. such steps. Bombing the North would demonstrate our resolve, not only to the South Vietnamese but also to the other Southeast Asian countrres and to-China, whose containment was one of the important justifications o e entire American involvement. Walt Rostov, the Chairman of va e s. o icy Planning Council, took a slightly different view,.emphasizing the importance of pressures as a clear signal to the North and to China 01 U. e ermina tion and resolve and its willingness to engage the tremendous power a 1 s disposal in support of the 1954 and 1962 Geneva agreements.Ambassador Taylor supported strikes against the North as a means of reducing in. 1. tration and as a way of bolstering South Vietnamese morale. As is readily apparent, there was no dearth of reasons .or striking North. Indeed, one almost has the impression that there reasons than were required. But in the end, the declsion to go a--)a wi' ie strikes seems to have resulted as much from the lack of alterna rye pro posals as from any compelling logic advanced in their favor. By anuary, for example, William Bundy, while still supporting the pressures, could only offer the following in their favor "on balance we believe that such action would have some faint hope of really improving the Vietnamese situation, an', a oye a , would put us in a much stronger position to hold the n' ine  defense, namely Thailand." And it would put us m a e e tion in our Asian relations "since we would have appeared to Aslans to have done a lot more about it." It is interesting to note that during the deliberations of September one of the preconditions to such strikes had been generally ac uw ege as a unity of domestic American opinion in support of such Presr en 1a y authorized action. During the November debates, this is no ongeran important factor. Indeed, it is openly conceded that such action is likely to evoke opposition in both domestic and international puo ic opinion. Another interesting aspect of this policy debate was that the question 01 Constitutional authority for open acts of war against a sovereign na ion was never seriously raised. Phase I of the newly approved program went into effect in mid-December. The BARREL ROLL "armed recce" by U.S. aircraft in the Laotlan panhandle began on a limited scale on December 14. It had been foreseen .a e  .      number of sorties would slowly increase with each succeeding v.eekow-ever, once the first week's level of two missions of four aircraft eac was determined by Secretary McNamara, it became the guideline for e remainder of December and January. Covert GVN operations along t e Nor Vietnamese coast were continued at about the level of the previous mon s and JCS proposals for direct U.S. air and naval support were rejec e .. Furthermore, the public disclosure of information on DRV in.i la ion in o the South was deferred at the request of Secretary McNamara. On December 24, the Viet Cong bombed a U.S. officers billet in Saigon killing two Americans. MACV, CINCPAC, the JCS, and Ambassador Taylor all called immediately for a reprisal strike against the North of the kind authorized under pnase For reasons still not clear, the Administration decided agains sue a reprisal. Thus, in purely military terms, the phase 1 perio urne ou to be little more than a continuation of measures already underway. ( e BARREL ROLL activity apparently was not differentiated by the DRV from RIAF strikes until well into January.) One of the explanations for this failure to fully implement the December 1 decisions was the political crisis that erupte in ou . renam. Ambassador Taylor had returned to South Vietnam on December 7 ana imm i ately set about getting the GVN to undertake the reforms we desrred, making clear to both the civilian and military leaders that the implementation of phase II was contingent on their efforts to revive the flagging war e j.or and morale in the South. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a military purge of the civilian government in late December and rumors. .rea s u a he would be declared uersonna non grata. The political crisis or e on into January with no apparent solution in sight in spite of our eavy pressure on the mi 1 i.tary to return to a civilian regime. An , wi e ay or struggled with the South Vietnamese generals, the war effort continue "o decline. At the same time that Taylor had been dispatched to Saigon a vigorous U.S. diplomatic effort had been undertaken with.our Asian and rAiO allies to inform them of the forthcoming U.S. intensification of the war, wl the expected eventual strikes against the North. The fact that our allies now came to expect this action may have been a contributmg reason in ' e February decision to proceed with phase II in spite of the fai ure oi e South Vietnamese to have complied with our requirements. In any case, 1 added to the already considerable momentum behind the policy oi stri.ng e North. By the end of January 1965, william Bundy, McNaughton, Taylor an others had come to believe that we had to proceed with phase II irrespec ive of what the South Vietnamese did. Clear indication that the Administration was considering some kind of escalation came on January 25- Ambassador Taylor was asked to comment on a proposal to withdraw U.S. dependents from Saigon so as to clear the decks." Previously, this action, which was now approved by the JCS, was always associated with pressures against the North, While there-s no indication of any decision at this point to move into phase II, it is clear that the preparations were already underway.

In a landslide victory, President Johnson is re-elected with a new Vice President, Hubert Humphrey. The JCS place in writing their request for reprisal action against North Vietnam in retaliation for the Bien Hoa attack. Failure to act may be misinterpreted by the North Vietnamese as a lack of will and determination in Vietnam. In separate memos to the Secretary, the JCS recommend covert GVN air strikes against North Vietnam and additional U.S. deployments to South East Asia to make possible implementation of U.S. strikes should these .be approved. The working Group circulates its draft paper on the "Options" available to the U.S. in South Vietnam. They are three (A) continuation of present policies in the hope of an improvement in the South but strong U.S. resistance to negotiations; (B) strong U.S. pressures against the North and resistance of negotiations until the DRV was ready to comply with our demands; and (C) limited pressures against the North coupled with vigorous efforts to get negotiations started and recognition that we would have to compromise our objectives. Option B is favored by the Working Group. The JCS renews its recommendation for strikes against the North tempering it slightly in terms of "a controlled program of systematically increased military pressures."

Taking a somewhat different tack, the then Director of States Policy Planning Staff, W. W. Rostow, proposes military pressures against the North as a method of clearly signaling U.S. determination and commitment to the North. No consensus is reached, but Option A is generally rejected as promising only eventual defeat. Option B is favored by the JCS and CIA, while State and OSD favor Option C. No firm conclusion is reached on the issue of sending ground troops to South Vietnam. Having returned for consultations, Ambassador Taylor meets with the NSC Principals and after giving a gloomy report of the situation in South Vietnam, recommends that to shore up the GVN and improve morale we take limited actions against the North but resist negotiations until the GVN is improved and the DRV is hurting. He proposed an extended Option A with the first stages of Option C. This proposal was adopted by the Principals an the recommendation to be made to the President. In a follow-up meeting, the Principals decide to propose a two  phase program to the President. The first phase would be a thirty-day  .

The second phase would involve direct air strikes against the North as in Option C. wi T1 i am Bundy was charged with preparing a draft NSAM to this effect and an infiltration study was commissioned. Meeting to review the draft prepared by Bundy, the Principals decided not to call it a NSAM. Its provisions are those recommended on 28 Nov. Phase II would be a graduated and mounting set of primarily air pressures against the North coupled with efforts to sound out the DRV on readiness to negotiate on U.S. terms. A recommendation on linking U.S. actions to DRV infiltration is deleted. While the exact decisions made at this meeting of the Principals with the President are not available, it is clear that he approved in general terms the concept outlined in the Bundy paper. He gave his approval for implementation of only Phase I, however. The President stressed the need for Taylor to get improve-ment from the GVN and the need to brief our allies on our new course of action, and to get more assistance from them in the conflict. The President meets privately with Taylor and gives him instructions, that he is to explain the new program to the GVN, indicate to its leaders that the Phase II U.S.  xi     By NWD Date 201 I DATE 4 Dec 64 7 Dec 64 .7-9 Esc 64 9 Dec 64 10 Dec 64 11 Dec 64  EVENT OF DOCUMENT Cooper Report on Infiltration Taylor Meets with Premier Huong Prime Minister wilson briefed Second Taylor-Huong- Khanh Meeting Souvanna Phouma Approves U.S. Laos Strikes GVN Announces Greater Efforts DESCRIPTION strikes against the North are contingent on improvement in the South, and explain that these will be cooperative efforts. A thorough study on North Vietnamese infiltration as commissioned by the Principals is submitted to the NSC and later forwarded to Saigon. Decisions on its release are continually deferred. The day after his return to Saigon, Taylor meets with Premier Huong and with General Khanh and outlines the new U.S. policy and states the requirements this places on the GVN. In washington on a state visit, British Prime Minister Wilson is thoroughly briefed on the forthcoming U.S. actions. On 4 Dec., william Bundy had gone to New Zealand and Australia to present the 'new policy and seek support. Other envoys were meeting with the re-mainirtg Asian allies. At a second meeting tri th Huong and Khanh, Taylor presents a detailed set of actions he desires the GVN to take to improve the situation and receives agreement from the two leaders. The U.S. proposal for armed air recce over the Laotian corridor is presented to Souvanna Phouma who gives his assent. Complying with Taylors request, the GVN announces stepped-up efforts to improve the campaign against the VC and to reform the government.  .

Secretary McNamara sets two missions of four aircraft each as the weekly level of BARREL ROLL activity. The NSC Principals approve McNamaras recommendation that BARRELL ROLL missions be held at constant levels through Phase I. It is revealed that adverse sea conditions have brought maritime operations against the DRV to a virtual halt. At McNamaras insistence it is agreed that the infiltration study will not be made public. Late in the evening, the military high command, led by Khanh, moved to remove all power from the civilian regime of Premier Huong by dissolving the High National Council. Khanh assumes power.

In view of the continued deterior-ation of the-situation in the South and the prevailing view that the U.S. was going to seek a way out, Bundy recommended some limited meas-ures, short of Phase II (i.e. recce, a reprisal, evacuation of U.S. de-pendents, etc.), to strengthen our hand.

POLICY DEBATE IN NOVEMBER In their Southeast Asia policy discussions of August-October 1964, Administration officials had accepted the view that overt military pressures against North Vietnam probably would be required. Barring some critical developments, however, it was generally conceded that these should not begin until after the new year. Preparations for applying such pressures were made in earnest during November. 1. Immediate Antecedents In Administration policy discussions, the two developments most often cited as perhaps warranting implementation of overt military pres-sures before 1965 were (1) increased levels of infiltration of guerrillas into South Vietnam and (2) serious deterioration of the GVN. Evidence of both was reported to Washington during October. National intelligence estimates gave the GVN little hope of sur-viving the apathy and discouragement with which it was plagued. They reported, "Government ministries in Saigon are close to a standstill, with only the most routine operations going on." U.S.GVN planning was not being followed by GVN action. A coup by disgruntled South Vietnamese military figures was believed irrminent (one had been attempted unsuccess-fully on 13 September). Moreover, the civilian government which General Khanh had promised for the end of October was seen as unlikely to bring about any real improvement. 1 A threat of GVN capitulation to the NIE, in the form of accept-ing a coalition government, was also seen as a real possibility. Citing "numerous signs that Viet Cong agents have played a role in helping sus-tain the level of civil disorder...in the cities," intelligence reports estimated that it was the Communist intention to seek victory through a "neutralist coalition" rather than by force of arms. Perhaps straining a bit, an estimate stated, "The principal GVN leaders have not to our knowledge been in recent contact with the Communists, but there has been at least one instance of informal contact between a lesser governmental official and members of the NLF." 2 Another estimate portrayed the DRV and Chinese as regarding South Vietnam as a "developing political vacuum," soon to be filled "with a neutralist coalition government dominated by pro-Communist elements." 3 Reports of increasing infiltration began arriving in mid-October. Ambassador Taylor cabled on the l4th that he had received indications of a "definite step-up in infiltration from North Vietnam, particularly in the northern provinces" He went on to report .  .      "A recent analysis suggests that if the present rate of infiltration is maintained the annual figure for 1964 will be of the order of 10,000. Furthermore...we are finding more and more 'bona fide' North Vietnamese soldiers among the infiltrees. I feel sure that we must soon adopt new and drastic methods to reduce and eventually end such infiltration if we are ever to succeed in South Vietnam."4 A similar report was cabled directly to the white House on 16 October. In it, Ambassador Taylor repeated his comments on infiltration and advised the President of the steadily worsening situation in South Vietnam. The Ambassador reported the infiltration of northern-born conscripts and relayed GVN claims that they were coming in organised units. He pointed out that with the advent of the dry season, the problem would assume even greater magnitude and urged that it be given immediate attention. 5 The Taylor estimates of end-year infiltration totals probably were quite alarming. If accurate they indicated that the rate had risen sharply during September and early October The total number of infiltrees for 1964 as of 1 September was then estimated as 4,700. 6 Of particular concern, no doubt, was the apparent emphasis on reinforcing Communist units in the Central Highlands and in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. These warnings came hard on the heels of widespread press reports of badly weakened GVN control in three portions of the country. 7 The JCS seized on these fresh reports and resubmitted their proposals for taking prompt measures against North Vietnam. On 21 October, they argued "Application of the principle of isolating the guerrilla force from its reinforcement and support and then to fragment and defeat the forces has not been successful in Vietnam The principle must be applied by control of the national boundaries or by eliminating or cutting off the source of supply and direction." 8 On the 27th they submitted a major proposal for "strong military actions" to counteract the trends cited in the national intelligence estimates and in the Taylor cables. In language identical to that used in two August memoranda and at the September strategy meeting, they stated that such actions were "required now in order to prevent the collapse of the U.S. position ir Southeast Asia." They then recommended a program of actions to support the following strategy a. Depriving the Viet Cong of out of country assistance by applying military pressures on the...DRV to the extent necessary to cause the DRV to cease support and direction of the insurgency. 2  .     SVN. based that;  b. Depriving the VC of assistance within SVN by expanding the counterinsurgency effort military, economic, and political -- within c. Continuing to seek a viable effective government in SVN on the broadest possible consensus. d. Maintaining a military readiness posture in Southeast Asia (1) Dymnstratps the U.S. will and capability to escalate the action if required. (2) Deters a major Communist aggression in the area. 9 The program recommended by the JCS included a list of actions to be taken within South Vietnam and a separate list of actions outside. The Chiefs had listed them in order of increasing intensity, and they requested authority "to implement now" the first six actions within the country and the first eight outside. The latter included air strikes by GVNFARMGATE aircraft against Communist LOC's in Laos and in the southern portion of North Vietnam. 10 In the context of the reported worsening situation in South Vietnam, the JCS proposal was given serious consideration in OSD. Since Ambassador Taylor had emressed concern over initiating overt pressures against North Vietnam "before we have a responsible set of authorities to work with in South Vietnam," a copy of the JCS paper was forwarded to him for review and comment. The OSD's stated indention was to consider the Ambassadors views before developing a. proposal to present to President Johnson. 11 while this proposal was still under consideration (1 Novemoer 1964), Viet Cong forces'attacked U.S. facilities at the Bien Hoa airbase with 8lmml mortar fire. Four American servicemen were killed, and five B-57 tactical bombers were destroyed, and major damage was inflicted on eight others. 12 Administration attention was focused immediately on the question of what the United States should do in response to the Bien Hoa provoca-tion. It will be recalled that such an eventuality had been discussed at the September strategy meeting. The Presidential directive which resulted from it stated "we should be prepared to respond as appro-priate against the DRV in the event of any attack on U.S. units or any special DRVVC action against SVN." 13 As of the end of October (in anticipation of resumed DE SOTO Patrols), elements of our Pacific forces were reported as "poised and ready" to execute reprisals for any DRV attacks on our naval vessels. Thus, there was a rather large expectancy among Administration officials that the United States would do something in retaliation.        Apparently, the decision was made to do nothing -- at least not of a retaliatory nature. At a white House meeting to discuss possible courses of action, on 1 November, "concern was expressed that proposed U.S. retaliatory punitive actions could trigger North VietnameseCHICOM air and ground retaliatory acts." Questions were raised about "increased security measures and precautionary moves of U.S. air and ground unics to protect U.S, dependents, units and installations against such reuali-ation. 14 Following the meeting, a White House news release announced that the President had ordered the destroyed and badly damaged aircraft replaced. Administration officials stated that "the mortar attack musc be viewed in the light of the Vietnamese war and of the whole Southeast Asian situation. If the United States is to retaliate against North Vietnam in the future," they reportedly said, "it musc oe for oroader reasons than the strike against the Bien Hoa base." Moreover, they drew a contrast between this incident and the Tonkin Gull attacKs where our destroyers were "on United States business." 15 Source documents available do not indicate that any further decisions were made on the Bien Hoa matter. A second meeting to discuss possible U.S. actions was "tentatively scheduled." for 2 November, out tnc available materials contain no evidence that it was held. 11. President Johnson was scheduled to appear in Houston that afternoon, for his final pre-election address, and it may be that the second White House meeting was called off. In any event, unofficial reports from Saigon, two days later, stated that most of the B-57s had been withdrawn from the Bien Hoa base. While acknowledging that "some" had been removed to Clark Air Base, in the Philippines, official spokesmen in Saigon refused to comment on whether or not a wholesale withdrawal had taken place. 17 One thing is certain; there were no retaliatory strikes authorised following the attack on the U.S. bomber base. However, retaliatory measures were proposed. On 1 Novemoer, the JCS suggested orally to Secretary McNamara that air strikes be authorized on key Communist targets in both Laos and North Vietnam. According to the JCS plan, those in Laos would be hit within 24-36 hours after approval, with forces already in place, and these attacks would divert attention from the preparation necessary for the stronger actions to follow. The latter would include a B-52 night attack on Phuc Yen airfield (outside Hanoi), to be followed by a dawn strike by USAF and Navy tactical aircraft against other airfields and POL storage in the Hanoi-Haiphong area. 18 Ambassador Taylor immediately cabled a Saigon Embassy-MACV recommendation for "retaliatory bombing attacks on selected DRV targets by combined U.S.VNAF air forces and for a policy statement that we will act similarly in like cases in the future." 19 In a later cable he made specific reference to "the retaliatory principle confirmed in NSAM 314," stating that if his initial recommendation was not accepted at least a lesser alternative should be adopted. This he described as 4  .      "intensifying 34-A operations and initiating air operations against selected targets as an interim substitute for more positive measures." 20 On 4 November, the JCS repeated in writing their recommendations of the lst, adding some explanatory comment and taking issue with certain aspects of the Taylor recommendations. They el-plained that they considered the VC attack on Bien Hoa airfield "a deliberate act of escala-tion and a change of the ground rules under which the VC have operated up to now." They cautioned against "undue delay or restraint" in making a response, since it "could be misinterpreted by our allies in Southeast Asia, as well as by the DRV and Communist China" and "could encourage the enemy to conduct additional attacks" Referring to Ambassador Taylor's recommendation to announce a policy of reprisal bombing, the JCS denounced a "tit-for-tat" policy as "unduly restrictive" and tending to "pass to the DRV substantial initiatives with respect to the nature and timing of further U.S. actions." 21 They concluded "Early U.S. military action against the DRV would lessen the possibility of misinterpretation by the DRV and Communist China of U.S. determination and intent and thus serve to deter further VC attacks such as that at Bien Hoa." In the meantime, there had been created what may have been the only concrete result from the high-level policy deliberations following the Bien Hoa incident. An interagency task force, known as the NSC working Group, had begun an intensive study of future U.S. courses of action. Recommendations from the JCS and others were passed on to that group for incorporation in their work. 22 2. Formation of the NSC Working Group The "NSC Working Group on SVNSEA" held its first meeting at 0930 hours, 3 November, thus placing the decision to organise such a group at sometime earlier probably on 2 November or perhaps even at the high-level meeting on 1 November. Its charter was to study "immediately and intensively" the future courses of action and alterna-tives open to the United States in Southeast Asia and to report as appropriate to a "Principals Group" of NSC members. In turn, this group of senior officials would then recommend specific courses of action to the President. Initially, the working group was given approximately one week to ten days to complete its work. 23 Actually, it developed and recast its reports over a period of three weeks or more. Four agencies were represented in the formal membership of the group. The Department of State contingent included Assistant Secretary Bundy (Chairman), Marshall Green, Michael Forrestal (both of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs), and Robert Johnson (of the Policy Planning Council). Assistant Secretary (ISA) McNaughton represented. OSD. Vice Admiral Lloyd-Mustin was the JCS member. The CIA was represented by Harold Ford. Other staff members from these agencies assisted in work on specific topics. 24        The Working Group's efforts were apportioned among seven tasks, the initial input for each being accomplished by a particular member or subcommittee, as follows 25 TOPIC Assessment of the current situation in South Vietnam, including policy direction of interested powers. U.S. objectives and stakes in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Broad options (3) available to the United States. Alternative forms of possible negotiation. Analyses of different options vis-a-vis U.S. objectives and interests. Immediate actions in the period prior to Presidential decision on options. RESPONSIBILITY Intelligence community William Bundy Bundy and ISA StatePolicy Planning Council JCS to propose specific actions; Policy Planning Council to examine po-litical impacts of the most violent option first. StateFar East Bureau Most inputs were made in the form of either (1) draft papers treating fully a topic intended for inclusion in the Working Groups final submission or (2) memoranda commenting on an initial draft paper and suggesting alterations. Because of the unique responsibilities and advisory processes of the JCS, their member apparently chose to make initial inputs largely through references to or excerpts from regular JCS documents; he also contributed to the redrafting of the option analyscs. 26 The initial papers on each of the topics were circulated among the Working Group members, reviewed in consultation with their parent organizations and modified. Some positions passed through as many as three drafts before being submitted to the Principals. 3. Working Group Assessments of the Utility of Pressures The NSC Working Group approached its work with the general assessment that increased pressures against North Vietnam would be both useful and necessary. However, this assessment embraced a wide range of considerations stemming from the developing situation in South Viet-nam and a variety of viewpoints concerning what kinds of pressures would be most effective.  .      a. Sense of Urgency. As the Working Group began its delibera- tions, an awareness that another Bien Hoa could occur at any cime was prominent in both the official and the public mind. The tenuous security of U.S. bases in South Vietnam had received wide publicity. 2f More-over, the news services were reporting the threat or civil protest against the new Saigon government, and the increased level of guerrilla infiltration from the North was being publicly aired. 28 These develop-ments lent an added sense of urgency to the Groups work. The Chairman of the Working Group was sensitive to these developments and to related attitudes within the Administration. For example, he indicated that cne intelligence agencies were "on the verge of..agreement that infiltration has in fact mounted," and that the Saigon mission was urging that, we surface this by the end of this week or early next week. He stressed that "the President is clearly thinking in terms of maximum use of a Gulf of Tonkin reprisal rationale." The nature of such a decision was expected to be either for an action that would show toughness and hold the line till we can decide the big issue, or as a basis for starting a clear course of action under...broad options. He implied that our intention to stand firm in South Vietnam was being communicated to the USSR ("Secretary Rusk is talking today to Dobrynin ) and indicated the desirability of President Johnson signa mg someci'n& similar rather soon through the public media. This was seen as parycu-larly important "to counter any SVN fears of a softening in our po icy, presumably in view of our not responding to the Bien Hoa re a.civ. Chairman Bundy was aware also of the significance attached by some observers to the first U.S. actions after the Presidencies elec -on. As was pointed out to him, "all Vietnamese and other -nterested ooservers would be watching carefully to "see what posture the newly manda e Johnson Administration will assume." For this reason, Wilram H- van, head of the interagency Vietnam Coordinating Committee (and soon o oe appointed the new U.S. Ambassador to Laos), urged thatour --rst act-on be...one which gives the appearance of a determination co take iisus r necessary to maintain our position in Southeast Asia. An immediaue retaliation for any repetition of the Bien Hoa attack and armed recon-naissance missions in the Laotian Panhandle were cited as specmc examples. He went on to recommend to Mr. Bundy "I feel that it is important...that the Administrayion go on record fairly soon placing our policy in Viet Nam within, the larger perspective of our policies in the Western Pacific, especially as they involve confrontation with Communist China. 30 A sense of urgency for the Working Groups efforts was also de- rived from assessments of the trends within South Vietnam. For example, the intelligence panel composed of CIA, DIA, and StateINR members saw '7        little prospect for an effective GVN despite an acknowledged sloping o. "adverse political trends." In their view the political si uFion -n.s "extremely fragile," with the Saigon administration plagued oy confusion, apathy and poor morale" and the new leaderstnp ampere y v e older factionalism.

( Although indicating "better than even" chances that the Gy. cou . e on for the near future and thus afford a platform upon wnrc. ...Pvo prosecute the war and attempt to turn the tide, the pane pa.ne . a grim picture of its prospects. 31 This assessment was,prop. y instrumental in prompting Assistant Secretary McNaughton s cryp rc observation that "Progress inside SVN is important, out i is un .e a despite our best ideasand efforts." Besides, he observe , i i. at all it would take "at least several months. In his iew, u. e x of the Working Group, could in some measure compensate lor xs s ou progress inside South Vietnam "Action against North Vietnam is to some extent a substitute for strengthening the government in South Vl.etnam. That is, a less active VC (on orders from DRV) can be handled by a less efficient GVN (which we expect to have). o b. Views of DRV Susceptibility. The extent to which acmon against North Vietnam" might affect that nation's support o. u.ne conflicts in South Vietnam and Laos was a matter on which members of tne working Group did not fully agree. The intelligence panel members tended toward a pessimistic view. They pointed out tnau o e dsic elements of Communist strength in South Vietnam remain indigenous, and that "even if severely damaged" the DEV could continue o suppor the insurrection at a lessened level. Therefore, they stressed the U.S. ability to compel a halt to the DRV support depended on eroding Hanois will and persuading the DRV that the nrice of mounting the insurrection in the South at a high" level would be too great and that it would be preferable to reduce its aid...and direct at least a temporary reduction of V.C. activity. As the panel members saw it, this respite would then provide anoppor-tunity to stabilise and improve the GVN. But, in their words, nven so, lasting success would depend upon a substantial improvement m energy and effectiveness of the RVN government and pacification machinery." 33 However, the intelligence panel did not concede very strong chances for breaking the will of Hanoi. They thought it quite likely that the DRV was willing to suffer damage "in the course of a rest o. wills with the United States over the course of events in South Vietnam To support this view, they cited Hanoi's belief that international 8        pressure would develop against deliberate U.S. expansion of the war. Further, that given present trends in South Vietnam, both Hanoi and Peking had good reason to expect success without haying to initiate actions carrying the risk of the kind of war which would expose them to "the great weight of superior U.S. weaponry." The panel also viewed Hanoi as estimating that the U.S. will to maintain resistance in South-east Asia could in time be eroded that the recent U.S. election would provide the Johnson Administration with "greater policy flexibility" than it previously felt it had. 34 This view was challenged by the Working Group's JCS member as being too "negative." Interpreting the panels non-specific reference to "policy flexibility" in an extreme sense, he wrote "If this means that Hanoi thinks we are now in position to accept world-wide humiliation with respect to our formerly stated objectives in Vietnam, this is another reason why it is desirable that we take early measures to disabuse their thinking." Moreover, he indicated the JCS view that the slightly improved hopes for government stability (acknowledged by the panel) were good reason why "early and positive actions" should be taken. This point was reinforced by his judgment that (in contrast with its impact on esprit and political effectiveness) the GVNs "principal task is to afford the platform upon which the RVN armed forces, with U.S. assistance, prosecute the war." 35 In criticism of the intelligence panel's emphasis on the need to influence DRV will, Admiral Mustin indicated that enemy capabilities represented a more appropriate target. He stated the JCS assessment that "a. The actual U.S. requirement with respect to the DRV is reduction of the rata of delivery of support to the VC, to levels below their minimum necessary sustaining level... "b. In the present unstable situation something far less than total destruction may be all that is required to accom-plish the above. A very modest change in the government's favor...may be enough to turn the tide and lead to a successful solution. Of course it is not possible to predict in advance...the precise level of measures which will be required to achieve the above. This is the reason for de- signing a program of progressively increasing squeeze." One of the factors encouraging JCS optimism, he pointed out, was the . assessment accepted by the panel that both Hanoi and Peking wanted to avoid direct conflict with the United States. This would act as a de-terrent to Communist persistence, particularly if by a program of 9  .      military pressures, we were able to revise their assessment that they could win "without much risk of having to feel the weight of U.S. response." 36 Apparently as a result of these criticisms and their influence on other Working Group members, the Groups final assessment of DRV susceptibility to military pressures was somewhat modified. While con-tinuing to emphasise that affecting Hanoi's will was important, the crit-icality of it was obscured by concessions to the possible impact of damage to DRV capabilities and by greater reliance on conditional pnras-ing. For example "the nature of thc war in Vietnam is such that U.S. ability to compel the DRV to end or reduce the VC insurrect-on rests essentially upon the effect of the U.S. sanctions on the will of DRV leadership to sustain and enlarge that insurrection, and to a lesser extent upon the effect of sanctions on the capabili-ties of the DRV to do so." Although giving explicit recognition to "a rising rate of infiltration, and continuing to acknowledge limits to U.S. abilities to prevent the DRVs material support for the VC, the assessment stated that "U.S.-inflicted destruction in North Vietnam and Laos would reduce these sup-porting increments and damage DRVVC morale." It qualified this state-ment, however, by pointing out that the degree to which such damage would provide the GVN with a breathing spell would depend largely on "whether any DRV 'removal of its direction and support of the VC were superficial or whole." If superficial or "limited to gestures...that removed only the more visible evidences of the DRV increment," the report continued, "it would probably not be possible to develop a viable and free government in South Vietnam." 37 In general, the final assessment of DRV susceptibility to pressures was less discouraging than the intelligence panels initial submission, although it could not be considered particularly encouraging either. The reference to U.S. "policy flexibility," to which the JCS took such violent objection, was removed, and the following non-committing statement was used instead "Hanois immediate estimate is probably that the passing of the U.S. election gives Washington the opportunity to take new military actions against the DRV andor new diplomatic initiatives." If new military pressures were applied, the report indicated that Hanois leaders would be faced with a basic question "Is the U.S. determined to continue escalating its pressures to achieve its announced objectives ...or is the U.S. escalation essentially a limited attempt to improve the U.S. negotiating position?" It continued "Their decision...would be affected by the U.S. military posture in the area, by the extent and nature of the U.S. escalation, the character of the U.S. communication of its intentions, and their reading of domestic U.S. and inter-national .reactions to the inauguration of U.S. attacks on the North."  .      The report made no attempt to predict how the DRV might answer the basic question" given alternative assessments of the variables in e 9. paragraph. However, it did offer the caveat tha compre cnsi n  others intentions would almost certainly De diIfrculuon cn si eo, and especially so as the scale of hostilities mounued. 3, In assessing Hanoi's ability and willingness to sustain U.S. attacks in order to pursue its goals, the report continue is -but slightly pessimistic approach "We have many indications that the Hanoi leadership is acutely and nervously aware of the extent to whic i 01 Vietnams transportation system and industrial pan is v nerable to attack. On the other hand, North Vietnam s economy is overwhelmingly agriculture and, to alalge ex m , decentralized... .Interdiction of imports and e.. a- struction of transportation facilities and indus ra.a paic would cripple DRV industry.

Vietnam. The Working Group recorded its belief I- " exists between Hanoi and Peiping and that Hanoi consu S erpmg major decisions regarding South Vietnam." Because the C insmre served "Peiping's interests in undermining the U.S. poolcon sia and because of the Sino-Soviet dispute, the group thoug 1 1 e y the Chinese would "feel compelled to demonstrate their readiness to support" Hanoi in maintaining pressure on South Vietnam. o>.ever, was noted that "Chinese Communist capabilities to.augmen R o ie and defensive capabilities are slight," being limited a.gely to moc.es quantities of air defense equipment, additional jet fig uersan n-vc patrol craft. On the other hand, the group believed Moscow s role m Vietnam is likely to remain a relatively minor one. Khrus. cnev s successors were believed unwilling to run substantia riss o un el. -the GVN. Citing Hanois desire for continuing Soviet military and economic aid, the report stated an ironic judgment concerning t.e ess-militant of the large Communist powers "Moscows ability to influence decisions in Hanoi tends consequently to be proportional to the North Vietnamese regimes fears of American action against it, rising in n        moments of crisis and diminishing in quieter periods. Moscow's willingness to give overt backing to Hanoi, however, seems to be in inverse proportion to the level of threat to North Viet-nam." 4p (Underlining added) 4. Perceptions and Development of U.S. Pressure Options The NSC Working Group began its deliberations with a variety of U.S. actions in mind and with an apparently flexible approach to the objectives that the Admim strati on might reasonably seek to achieve. As ideas were exchanged and debated, however, objectives became somewhat less flexible and options seemed to narrow. Such a process could have resulted from either (1) preconceptions on the part of particularly influential members; (2) a bureaucratic tendency to compromise; or (3) simply the limited availability of practical alternatives. A combination of these factors may even have been at work in the case of the Working Group. An assessment of this nature is beyond the scope of this pri-marily documentary research effort. Still, the question is an important one to reflect on in tracing the development of Working Group reccmmen-dations. a. Perception of U.S. Objectives and Interests. National ob-jectives in Southeast Asia were regarded in two categories; existing (sometimes called "initial") policy objectives and those comprising a possible fallback position. The former did not change and did not undergo any reinterpretation during the course of the Working Groups study. These were seen as (1) "helping a government of South Vietnam defend its independence," and (2) "working to preserve in Laos an international neutralized settlement." Three basic "factors" were recognised as "standing behind" these policy objectives "a. The general principle of helping countries that try to defend their own freedom against communist subversion and attack. "b. The specific consequences of communist control of 1 South Viet-Nam and Laos for the security of, successively, Cambodia, Thailand (most seriously), Malaysia, and the Philippines -- and result-tng increases in the threat to India and more in the realm of morale effects in the short term the threat to other nations in Asia. c. South Viet-Nam, and to a lesser extent, Laos, as test cases of communist "wars of national liberation" world-wide." 41 . Current U.S. objectives in South Vietnam and Laos were seen as an integral part of the "overall policy of resisting Communist expansion world-wide," and particularly a part of the "policy of resisting the expansion of Communist China and its allies, North Viet-Nam and North 12  .      Korea." Thus, for South Vietnam to come under Communist control, "in any form," was seen as "a major blow to our basic policies. U.S. prestige is heavily committed to the maintenance of a non-Communist South Viet-Nam, and only less heavily so to a neutra-lized Laos." 42 Unlike the current objectives, those comprising a fall-back position dealt only with South Vietnam. Moreover, they were modified during the course of the Working Groups efforts. The modifications occurred in the way the objectives were presented in the context of the presentation -- rather than in their specific phrasing, lhe words remained the same throughout "1. To hold the situation together as long as possible so that we have time to strengthen other areas oi Asia. "2. To take forceful enough measures in the situation so that we emerge from it, even in the worst case, with our standing as the principal helper against Communist expan-sion as little impaired as possible. "3. To make clear...to nations in Asia particularly, that failure in South Viet-Nam, if it comes, was due to special local factors that do not apply to other nations we are committed to defend -- that, in short, our will and ability to help those nations defend themselves is noc im-paired." 43 At first, these fall-back objectives for South Vietnam were presented as possible alternatives to be considered in conjunction with a reassessment of the costs and risks associated with currently ac-knowledged objectives. Fol 1owing its recognition of the extent to which U.S. prestige had been committed, even the second draft (8 November) stated "Yet...we cannot guarantee to maintain a non-Communist South Viet-Nam short of committing ourselves to whatever degree of military action would be required to defeat North Viet-IIam and probably Communist China militarily. Such a commitment would involve high risks of a major conflict in Asia, which could, not be confined to air and naval action but would almost inevitably involve a Korean-scale ground action and possibly even the use of nuclear weapons at some point." Despite all this, it was acknowledged, South Vietnam might still come apart," leaving the United States deeply committed but with much of its initial justification disintegrated. "Hence," the evaluation continued, 13  .      "...we must consider realistically what our over-all objectives and stakes are, and just what degree of risk and loss we should be prepared to make to hold South Vietnam, or alternatively, to gain time and secure our further lines of defense in the world and specifically in Asia." 44 Significant, in shedding light on the subtle changes that occurred in this rationale during the ensuing three or four weeks, was its treatment of the third fall-back objective. Observing that mose of the world had written off" both South Vietnam and Laos in 1954, an early draft acknowledged that neither had acquired the international standing of such former targets of Communist aggression as Greece, Iran and Soutn Korea. It went on to point out several historical character istics of South Vietnam! and Laos that made them such unique cases, in-cluding (1) "a bad colonial heritage" and inadequate preparation for self-government; (2) a "colonialist tzar fought in half-baked fashion and lost1; and (3) "a nationalist movement taken over by communis t>s ruling in the other half of an ethnically and historically united country" It then added; The basic point, of course, is that we have never cou-ld defend a government or a people that had ceusea. co care strongly about defending themselves, or that were unable to maintain the fundamentals of government. And the overwhelming world impression is that these are lacking elements in South Viet-Nam Moreover, the commentary noted that there was widespread-4 y that if South Vietnam were lost it would be due co its lack 01 thes elements. 45 Subsequent to circulation of the initial draft of the objectives and national interest" Section, a number of critical or re ' M were directed toward Group Chairman Bundy. On t Roem er, ' -Forrestal suggested that "an important flavor was ac'rng  ue analysisnamely, "the role of China" and her neea for ideological successes abroad." In his view, given Chinese polrcy, e ) our withdrawal from a situation in which the people we were help seemed unable to help themselves" would be more po 1 in Asia than if China did not exist. He thought the bj  be to "contain" Chinese political and ideological mi uence  r longest possible period," thus providing time to create a . least, Titoist regimes on the periphery of China  0- William Sullivan also urged placing U.S. policy in 7.e -nom .n e "larger perspective" of the political confrontation vxn o.,muniu a. In an attached, longer exposition of policy rationale ofm cs ern Pacific, he presented conceptions of the U.S. problem qur e slmr c.r those advocated by Forrestal. The political future o. uac po mes Asia was portrayed as depending largely on a struggle e w,en ,s n '14  .      and Peking. Chinese political and ideological aggressiveness was viewed as a threat to the ability of these peoples to determine their own futures, and hence to develop along ways compatible with U.S. interests. The U.S. commitment to defeat North Vietnamese aggress-on, even at the risk of "direct military confrontation" with Communist China, was per-ceived as part of the longer-term policy of establishing conditions which permit the independent nations of the region to develop the aoility and confidence "to cope with the emerging and expanding power o. Cam.. ( These comments may have influenced that part of the 8 November version which referred to current U.S. objectives as part of the broader policy of "resisting the expansion of Communist China and its allies The JCS member also stressed the importance of not falling back from current policy aims. He stated that "in the eyes of the -world" the United States was committed to its initial objectives "as matters of national prestige, credibility, and honor." Further, that U.S retention of "a measure of free-world leadership" required "successful defense" in South Vietnam against the wars of national liberation strategy. Admiral Mustin criticized the Bundy draft for overstating "the degree of diffi-culty associated with success for our objectives in SVN." He asserted "Our first objective is to cause the DRV to terminate support of the SEA insurgenciesTo achieve this objective does not necessarily require that we 'defeat North Viet-Nam, ' and it almost certainly does not require that we defeat Communist China. Hence our commitment to SVN does not involve a high probability, let alone high risks,' of a major conflict in Southeast Asia." He characterized the drafts expression of concern over rrs.us an as an inference "as though the harder we try the more we suand o ns, and to lose. On the contrary, he stated, the 'best nope for minlmiz-ing risks, costs, and losses in achieving our objectives could be a a-ne though "a resolute course of action." 48 Admiral Mustin also attacked the implication that there was "some alternative to our holding South Viet-Nam. Taere is none, he stated, adding "We have no further fall-back position in Southeast Asia in the stated view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.'' Specifically, he wamec that to attempt to strengthen other areas of Asia, in the context of our having been pushed out of SVN, would he a thoroughly non-produccive e.foxt militarily" Moreover, characterising the draft's concessions to the unique difficulties in Laos and South Vietnam as sour grapes, he attacked its assumptions that we could convince other nations that failure in South Vietnam was due to strictly local factors. Hewarned that other nations would regard any such explanation onourparu as "completely transparent." Concerning any lack of GVN will co defend itself, he commented, "A resolute United States would ensure...that t s lack were cured, as the alternative to accepting the loss.. The JCS. member portrayed a U.S. failure in South Vietnam as an aojecc humiliacion, ' 15        that would be disastrous in shaking the faith and resolve of the nn Communist nations who rely on the United States for major hlp against, Communist aggression. In that event, he saw l-ttle possibility -or effective U.S. reassurances. 49 The impact of these criticisms can be seen in the Working Group's final assessment of U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. In ex-plaining the need to consider a fall-back position, the statement stressed the need merely to assess "the drawbacks associated with it. Lending to this judgment were admissions that ''there is some chance that South Vietnam might come apart under us whatever course of action we pursue" and "strong military action necessarily involves some risks of an enlarged and even conceivably major conflict in Asia." Then followed the statement "These problems force us to weight in our analysis the drawbacks and possibilities of success of various options, including the drawbacks of accepting only the fall-back objectives set forth below. (Underlining added) Missing was the earlier draft's reference to potential costs and risks involved in pursuing current objectives. Missing also was any sugges-tion that the Administration might find some advantage in seeking an alternative to these objectives. 50 The working Group went on to assess, in terms almost identical to those in the initial draft, the likely consequence of Communist con-trol of South Vietnam for different world areas of interest to the United States. The- group saw important distinctions between the likely impact on U.S. interests in Asia and those in the world at large. For the latter, the most significant variable was seen as the degree to which adverse developments in Southeast Asia might produce domestic public revulsion against all U.S. commitments overseas "Within NATO (except for Greece and Turkey to some degree), the loss of South Vietnam probably would not shake the faith and resolve to face the threat of Communist aggression or confidence in us for major help. This is so provided we carried out any military actions in Southeast Asia without taking forces from NATO and without generating a wave of "isolation-ism" in the U.S. In other areas of the world, either the nature of the Communist threat or the degree of U.S. commit-ment or both are so radically different than in Southeast Asia that it is difficult to assess the impact. The question would be whether the U.S. was in fact able to go on with its present policies." 51 For Asia, other than Southeast Asia, the working Groups assessment went as follows 16  .      "The effects in Asia generally would depend heavily on the circumstances in which South Vietnam was lost and on whether the loss did in fact greatly weaken or lead to the early loss of other areas in Southeast Asia. National China..., South Korea, and the Philippines would need maximum reassurance. While Japans faith in our military posture and determination might not be shaken, the growing feeling that Communist Chi na. must somehow be lived with might well be accentuated. India and Iran appear to be the Asian problem cases outside the Far East. A. U.S. defeat could lead to serious repercussions in these countries. There is a great deal we'could still do to reassure these countries, but the picture of a defense line clearly breached could have serious effects and could easily, over time, tend to unravel the whole Pacific and South Asian defense struc-tures. 52 The consequences for Southeast Asia of Communis con  South Vietnam were seen as highly differentiated ano. y no men matic. The "domino theory" was viewed as "over-srmplxic... 1Working Group felt that it might apply "if, but only 11,.

These developments were seen as 5 pressure on Thailand and encouraging Indonesia to increase 1 -e on Malaysia. Thailand, it was noted, had "an historic.tendency to make 'peace with the side that seems to be winning, ana e, , . serious Malay-Chinese problem" was cited. The Wonting re p "We could do more in Thailand and with the British in Malaysia to reinforce the defense of these countries, the initial shock wave would be great..." This assessment was quite close to that made in.the . which Bundy had gone on to point out that even U- we syccee e. coming the shock wave in Thailand and Malaysia, the s  <,e  uphill for a long time to come." But in neither case was much credence placed in the domino theory. 53 It should be noted that Admiral Mustin and tne vC ard n with this assessment. The Admiral commented chat une R J.e so-called domino theory "to be the most realistic es   and Thailand, probably Burma, possibly Malaysia. In p' I lte 1964, these nations were expected to collapse palry a.n as the corollary to our withdrawal." $4 Accordingy, a C1 tation of the differing viewpoint of the JCS was plo.co.u n e r.>. Groups final report. 55 . 17  .     S.nsitive In summarizing its assessment of the consequences of Communist control in South Vietnam, the working Group stated "There are enough 'if s' in the above analysis so that it cannot be concluded that the loss of South Vietnam would soon have the totally crippling effect in Southeast Asia and Asia generally that the loss of Berlin would have in Europe; but it could be that bad, driving us to the progressive loss of other areasor to talcing a stand at some point so that there would almost certainly be a major conflict and perhaps the great risk of nuclear war." 56 b. Evolution of Options. The alternative courses of action perceived by the working Group went through a fairly rapid evolution. As conceived by Chairman Bundy and John McNaughton, who apparently collaborated in their initial formulation, the options would offer a wide range of military actions and diplomatic postures. As the views of other members and interested officials were expressed, and as it became more apparent how little flexibility was perceived with respect to national objectives, subtle changes occurred. The effect was to narrow somewhat the rang? of effects which the different options might achieve and to tend to blur the distinctions between them. However, the process occurred so early in the life of the Working Group that it is difficult to pin-point the changes and somewhat presumptuous, relying only on documentary evidence, to explain them. The perceived options were three in number, labeled A, B, ano. C. Option A essentially was a continuation of military and nava, actions currently underway-or previously authorized, to include prompt rep isals for attacks on U.S. facilities or other VC ''spectaculars in South Vietnam. These were to be accompanied by continued resistance to a negotiated settlement unless stringent preconditions, amountmg co agreement to a.bide by U.S. interpretations of the Geneva Accords, v.ere met. Option B consisted of current policies plus a systematic program of progressively heavy military pressures against North Vietnam, to be continued until current objectives were met. Negotiations were to be resisted, as in "A," although to be entered ultimately, but they were to be carried on in conjunction with continued bombmg attacks. Option C combined current policies with (1) additional -- out somevmat .m-c-cder military pressures against North Vietnam and (2) a declared willingness to negotiate. Once negotiations were begun, the military pressures were to stop, although the threat to resume was to be kept alive. In a gtneral sense, these distinctions remained constant through-out the Working Group's effort. However, subtle changes occurred. In the initial conception of "B," it was perceived as "meshing at some point with negotiations," based on an underlying assumption that negotiations would probably be unavoidable. 57 The full analysis of this earliest form of "B" (discussed more fully later) makes it clear that some kind of international discussions ould probably begin fairly early and con-tinue as the intensity of our military pressures mounted. 53 Moreover,  Sensitive .      it is evident that these pressures would be applied deliberately o permit, evaluation of results at each step. Yet, the initial form o. B. was in-tended to embrace high intensity options in McNaughton s terminology, a "full squeeze." It will be recalled from the discussions earlier in the fall, that this term was applied to graduated operations that included mining harbors, bombing bridges and WC targets and eventually aceachwg industries. 59 As Option B developed, however, it became associated c'lu prolonged resistance to a negotiated settlement. 60 Moreover, a noug the intensity of the military operations it embraced remained about one same, they were perceived as being applied at a faster, less flexr e race. For example, in a comment about this option on 14 November, Admnal Lus in wrote "...while the Joint Chiefs of Staff offer the capability for pursuing Option "B" as defined, they have not explicitly recommended that the operations be conducted on a basis necessarily that inflexible. All implementing plans...would permit suspension whenever desired by national authority." 61 Perceptions of Option C became more like B. Initia y, t e additional pressures in "C" were conceived as "additional forcefu .measures and military moves." 62 They included such operations as extension o the current armed escort of reconnaissance flights in Laos to fu -f ee armed route reconnaissance -- gradually leading to s rm-la.i?, attacks agaans infiltration routes in the southern border regions of North V-eunam. me initial Option C also provided for authorization of the already planned for cross-border ground operations in Laos and possibly in camoodra. By 8 November, however, the pressure portion of this optron was perceivec. as (1) including eventual attacks against other-than-infiltration targets in North Vietnam and (2) giving "the impression of a steady delibel,e approach," the pace of which could be quickened if necessary, ko.eovel, in this later development of "C," the U.S. negotiating positron wo d to insist from the outset on full acceptance of the current U.S. objecives. Initially this position would incorporate certain additional bargaining elements that could drop out in the course of discussion. o3 This modification of the pressure and negotiation aspects of C led other members of the Working Group to express reservations. Robel Johnson stated that this "proposed stiffer version was little differen from "B. He argued that the only real differences now were (1) a declared willingness to negotiate and (2) our unwillingness under C to carry the action through to its ultimate conclusions. He cautioned that the new version was unlikely to produce the hoped for advantages of "pure C" and that it could convince the Communists that our negotiatory spirit was not sincere. 64 Enclosed with his comments were vne views of the CIA member, who also believed there would be confusion between B and the new "C" -- particularly as observed by the DRV. Ocher reser-vations were expressed by Assistant Secretary McNaughton, who urged thu the proposed pace of the new "C" be slowed down. This would be accomplished by dividing the additional pressure operations -nto distinct pnases, ...11 19  .     Scnsitive only the armed reconnaissance in Laos as part of the fiv p ae. ne OSD representative also urged not yielding to pressures co par ,c.pace in a Geneva conference until after several military ancons a een taken against the DRV. 65 Of all the reservations stated above, on..y the last (delaying Geneva, participation) was reflected in su sequent, descriptions of Option C. Even Option A was altered to some extent. The mam emphasrs for "A"- continued to be the currently adopted policies. At some tame prior to 8 November (when the final analysis was drafted), intel esc was s o.m in an "extended A." This version retained the policy of re sis mg R-C0 tiations in hope that the situation would improve, but it lncoipora.-c low-level pressure actions akin to the early stages of C. te ype and intensity of the actions "would vary in direct propo ion o success in convincing the world and our own public of the Hanoi's support, direction and control of the VC. It migh armed reconnaissance in Laos, include greater naval activity ong tn, coast, and gradually phase into strikes against LOG tar-gets inborn Vietnam. In terms of military actions alone, extended A resm eo. closely the initial version of "C." However, it was concedec. thau even an extended Option A did not offer a very promising means or moving toward negotiations. 66 Why did these changes take place? The available.documentary materials do not make this entirely clear. One factor whicn my c.v influenced the modifications in all three of the options 1 ccogm.cron of the problem of conflicting signals that could result, .rom r,p.isa actions. If reprisals were designed to be forceful and punitive ana intended to match the seriousness of VC provocations, they mignu e so strong as to interfere with the messages to Hanoi which .t >n.s origin, y intended would be conveyed by the graduated pressures. Indc.-d, 1 yas pointed out that operations orders already developed by c-luCPAC o. retaliations in response to attacks on DE SOTO Patrols (snot resumed) were "of magnitude which would not be politically via. e excep under extremely serious provocations. 67 Moreover, it wao.eare . au improperly orchestrated reprisals might create undue rnternaclona pressures for negotiations that could upset the negotiating sclacegy appropriate for the selected option. 63 Both "A" and "B" may have been altered as a result of changes made in "C." The objections raised to the new 'C may have encouraged Chairman Bundy to include an extended "A" that was closer m tne mii ary sense to his and McNaughton's original concept of graduated pressures. Moreoever, it had been pointed out that the same negotiating situations seen as appropriate for "C" (to include discussions 01 Laos andor . Cambodia as well as South Vietnam) could also apply to eventual negotia-tions arrived at through "A." 69 Besides, with the stiffening of tne "C" negotiating formula, the distinctions between the respective bar-gaining positions for "A" and "C" had become somewhat blurred. Option B s "20  .      faster pace in its later versions may have been an attempt to make a clear distinction between it and the new "C." Use of the term "fastfull squeeze" in reference to Option B began concurrently with descriptions of the stiffer version of Option C. 70 In addition, it is possible that the emphasis on a fast-paced "B," with its harsher measures, was motivated in part by a desire to make this option unattractive to higher authority. This may explain the rather perplexed tone of the previously cited Mustin comment comparing the JCS and working Group approaches. Other than the JCS member, most of the Working Group members'appear to have favored less intensive pressures than those being advocated by the military. Despite a sense of high stakes in Southeast Asia, which was shared by several members and other interested officials, many of these persons did not want the United States to plunge ahead with deeply committing actions as long as there was some doubt about the GVNs durability and commitment. 71 Not incompatible with the foregoing argument is a possible additional explanation for the stiffening of Option C. As U.S. objectives came to be viewed somewhat less flexibly, it is possible that dominant elements in the working Group thought it advisable to make "C" into a tougher position. There is little question that Option C was the natural heir of the concept of graduated pressures coupled with a negotiated settlement advocated at several points earlier in the year. Several of the working Group members had been instrumental in shaping those proposals and were quite naturally attached to them conceptually. Now, advocates of the graduated approach were confronted with (1) greater pressures from the JCS and their like-thinkers in the Congress; (2) recognition of little flexibility among Administration officials regarding interpretations of national interest and objectives; and (3) an increasingly critical situation in South Vietnam, it is likely that that these individuals viewed it necessary to stiffen their preferred approach in order to improve its compatibility with the current policy climate. whatever the reasons, the options for review and discussions were somewhat more closely alike than the original conceptions had been. Option A provided for intensified efforts to improve the situation in South Vietnam and for somewhat intensified military actions in line with current policy. Inside South Vietnam it provided for improvements in the GVN administrative performance and for strengthening different elements of the pacification program. These internal actions were stressed as necessary regardless of whatever other measures were decided on. Option A's provisions for measures outside the country included (1) continuing and increasing the GVNs covert maritime harassment program; (2) resuming the DE SOTO Patrol operations; (3) increasing the scope of Laotian T-28 attacks on infiltration targets in Laos and (4) when feasible, undertaking small-scale cross-border GVN ground and air operations into .21        the Laotian Panhandle. The option also included individual U.S. reprisal actions "not only against such incidents as the Gul.. cm f1 but also against any recurrence of VC 'spectaculars such as u-en oa. The aim of these actions would be to deter repetitions o. an  o pumsn for such actions in South Vietnam, "but not to a degree .a wo create strong international negotiating pressures. Basic to Option A was its provision for "continued rejection of negotiation in the hope that the situation will improve. Hoyever, i included recognition that "the GVN itself, or individual South Vietnamese in potentially powerful positions" might initiate discussions tn . ano. or the Liberation Front." If a coalition government v.e.e nus a.l, , the Working Group believed, the odds were that it would even cue y oe taken over by the Communist element." In the event of suc isussxons, the U.S. response under Option A might be either (1) svand as.l e, -us disassociating the United States from such a settlement, or () seA LO cover a retreat by accepting negotiations" through something te Geneva conference, which might buy additional time. 72 Option B provided for everything included in A" plus a program of U.S. military pressures against North Vietnam. These were o c n-tinue "at a fairly rapid pace and without interruption un agreed to stop supporting and directing the war in Sou le no-m an Laos. The pressures were to begin with attacks on in.il raulon c?.gecs and increase in intensity; however, the option included provision .a an early attack on Phuc Yen airfield and certain key bn ges in e northern part of North Vietnam might be required to reduce e cnmces of DRV interference with the spectrum of actions that were contemplated. Although our nubli c position on negotiations would be "totally inflexible" under Option B, it provided for recognition of the need to negotiate eventually. Under B, this would occur simultaneously with a continuation and escalation of the pressures and would be ase ont "inflexible insistence on our present objectives. Never.he ess, -> acknowledged the need "to deal with channels of international communi-cation, the UN, and perhaps despite our strong opposrcion -- a reconvened Geneva Conference of some sort" even before we aglc-e o enter into settlement talks. Moreover, while resisting negou.aions, the option provided for (1) making "the strongest possible public case of the importance, increase, end present intolerable level o. prtV in-filtration" and (2) "strengthening the picture of a military situauion in South Vietnam requiring the application of systemaurc military force.  Option C provided for every military action included in "A" plus "graduated military moves against infiltration targets, first in Laos and then in the DRV, and then against other targets in Norun Vietnam. he air strikes on infiltration routes within North Vietnam were to be pre-ceded by low-level reconnaissance flights over, the same general are&. Advantage was seen in initiating such measures "following either additional 22  .      VC 'spectaculars or at least strong additional evidence of major infil-tration." Moreover, Option C made provision for the possibility of making a "significant ground deployment to the northern part of South Vietnam, either in the form of a U.S. combat force or a SEATO-members force" as an additional bargaining counter. In any event, "C" was intended to "give the impression of a steady deliberate approach" and "designed to give the U.S. the option at any time to proceed or not, to escalate or not, and to quicken the pace or not. In "C," military pressures were to be accompanied by communi- cations with Hanoi andor Peiping" indicating in essence "a willingness to negotiate in an affirmative sense." From the outset "we would be... accepting the possibility that we might not achieve our objectives. Accordingly, the concept for "C" included provision for an initial nego-tiating position that added "certain bargaining elements to the basic U.S. objectives. Once negotiations started the military pressures wo c cease. As in "B," these would be preceded by a vigorous program of public information efforts and political consultations with Congressional leaders and foreign allies, surfacing information on DRV infiltration an explaining our rationale for action. The latter would be "that documented DRV illegal infiltration of armed and trained insurgents, and over-all DRV direction and control of VC insurgency, had now reached an intolerable level and that it was now necessary to hit at the infiltration and to bring pressure on Hanoi to cease this infiltration and direction." c. Significance of Negotiations. One of the most significant aspects of the NSC Working Groups analyses was its emphasis on a negotiated settlement as the final outcome of contemplated U.S. actions. Regardless of the option selected or the pressure actions employed, national negotiations in some form were perceived as the means by which the situation in Southeast Asia would ultimately be relieved. Even in the event of a unilateral GVN or a South Vietnamese splinter negotiation with the NLF, under circumstances of a relatively shallow U.S. commitment (Option A), negotiation under a Geneva format was regarded as a preferable outcome. 75 However, it is also clear that a parallel aim was to insure that pressures on behalf of such negotiations did not be-come compelling before the U.S. bargaining position could be improved. Information Services to Diverse Populations Developing Culturally Competent Library Professionals improved. Also significant is the fact that the kind of settlement which was seen as the purpose of negotiation was one which would end North Vietnam's participation in the conflicts in Southeast Asia -- and con currently, also end the United States' direct participation (as it was in 1964) in those conflicts. In view of the prevalent Administration perception of North Vietnam as instigator and aggressor in conflict within South Vietnam, it is ironic that the Working Group s considera-tions of a negotiated settlement did not include the problems of a political settlement in the South. In the available source materials, this subject was raised only once and even then was not dealt with further. The one instance was in the context of Robert Johnson's analysis of Option B. In it he pointed out that if a fully successful B negoia ion 23  .      resulted (one in which the DRV in fact complied yx x +mp4 have to extent that we ceased our pressure actions) we wou PV-mnl'= consider.. .whether or not to make compromises -- su,.l ", .  accept less then perfection for international f, agree to permit the NLF to become a legitimate noli i-o. rSouth, or agree to political consultations between S J I i,' In other words, at the level of the Working Group s ana jS  political stakes for which the game in Vietnam yas rta-J the VC ' and the very powerful and relevant cards held by ne ) GrouT) were not really considered.

(This may also have been signij-icanu 01 ne ministration's tendency at the time to view Communist China as co-ins 1 gator of the Vietnamese aggression.) The contemplated ground deployment also was seen as serving some auxillary functlons ( .) ro deter DRV ground force deployments into South Vietnam; (2) by axing, blocking positions, to reduce the infiltration into tne South hrougn Laos; and (3) (in the case of the multi-national force) to improve the international picture of our actions in South Vietnam by vircue o visible international participation. 79 As stated previously, the primary bargaining element in Option B was the application of clearly ascending military strues agonist to. 'n Vietnam. These would be halted only in return for.demonstrated. com-pliance with demands that it stop supporting and directing mill caIy operations in South Vietnam and Laos. It was pointed oat that DR7 compliance under pressure would be tantamount tosurrender. Further, if we insisted that compliance include calling off all acts o VC terrorism and of resistance to pacification efforts rn South Vrecnam, it would mean "virtual unconditional surrender." 2 To obtain suc. high stakes, the group recognised that intensive pressures P e re-quired. However, it also recognized that the combination 01 e i d-demands and harsh actions would be most likely to produce an verse in er national reaction and increased pressures for an early cease-fire an negotiations. The basic political objective perceived for Option B was to prevent international consideration...from interfering with om- continu-ing pressures against the DRV until the DRV has taken the actions we desire of it."

The initial negoua ing o je ("the complete termination of DRV support to the insurgency... ) Rf ., refined to specify that it incorporated three mndamen (a! , DRV cease its assistance to and direction of the Vc, (o) a an n e dent and secure GVN be reestablished; and (c) thau there e j-cqua 7. international supervising machinery." Specific areas o. give or e bargaining process were identified as the question of .lec , ec ions the degree of verification we would require. The group fur er pioi e that during negotiations the intensity with whicn the JR1 a es u c pursue its initial objectives would vary with the extent o improv erinm within the GVN. If the situation in South Vietnam got better the Uniecu States would press harder for acceptance of its initia pos-uion. 1 c  situation grew worse, "we would have to decide whether toinuensify our military actions, modify our negotiating positions, or 00uh. A Because of a declared willingness to negotiate from the outset, the approach to a negotiating situation under Opt-on C us yle.e  e Working Group as considerably different from that under Op ion . < ,rtas, in the latter case it was believed that the UN would provide cne mos useful medium for discussions, the preferred approach under Option vas through a Geneva-type meeting. The channels, both direct an ec , to Hanoi were not believed useful for negotiating purposes., ougn  tentially helpful in relaying impressions of current attitudes and negotiating positions in Hanoi and Peking, the Sov,e government 26  .      seen as a.useful negotiating intermediary. The UN was viewed as present-ing a special problem because of the approaching annual issue of Communist Chinese membership. For this reason the Working Group felt that it would not provide an effective negotiating forum until late February of March 1965, although it acknowledged the necessity of presenting the U.S. case before the Security Council. In view of these considerations the Working Group viewed it most desirable to yield to the expected pressures for a Geneva conference -- but only after conducting "a number of military actions against the DRV." 84 d. Perceived Reactions to Options. The Working Group evaluated the relative advantages and disadvantates of the three options and concluded that Option C provided the most promising course of action. The evaluation was based on three general criteria (1) likely reactions of allied and non-aligned foreign governments; (2) reactions within South Vietnam; and (3) effectiveness in bringing desired responses from the Communist government. With respect to the first, the group reported "Option A would cause no adverse reactions but if it failed it would leave a considerable after-taste of U.S. failure and ineptitude; Option B would run major risks of sharply expressed condemnation, which would be erased only if the course of action succeeded quite clearly and in reasonable time; Option C would probably be in between in both respects." With respect to the remaining criteria, Option A seemed likely to achieve little more than buying some time, and in some respects it appeared counterproductive, while Option B was viewed as standing "a greater chance than either of the other two of attaining our objectives," it also was seen as running "considerably higher risks of major military conflict with Hanoi and possibly Communist China." On balance, Option C was considered "more controllable and less risky of major military action" than "B" and more likely "to achieve at least part of our objectives" than "A." 85 The working Group reported that Option A appeared to offer "little hope of getting Hanoi out or an independent South Vietnam re-established.11 It was recognised that the actions included in this option could not physically affect the extent of infiltration from the North and would not be likely to affect Hanois determination to continue its policies. At best, the group believed, "they might...keep the DRV from engaging in further spectaculars, and thus keep the scale of the conflict in the south within some limits." However, Option A was conceded little chance of contributing to an improved GVN, in the short period of additional time its effects might possibly make available. The group recognized sagging morale apd doubts concerning U.S. intentions as the "most immediate problem" in South Vietnam. Several members felt that without further U.S. actions, political collapse was imminent that to add only reprisals for VC spectaculars might lift morale immediately thereafter, as in the case of 27  .      the Tonkin Gulf reprisals, but would not have lasting effect. At best, under "A," it was believed that the gradual deterioration in the country-side of South Vietnam would continue. 86 Although the Working Group viewed a decision to continue Option A indefinitely as ruling out either "B" or "C," it did suggest the possi-bility of extending "A" to its limits and gradually phasing into opera-tions like those in Option C. It was suggested that this might, over time, generate "favorable, or at least not unfavorable," domestic and international reaction which along with the increasing cost of gradual disruption in North Vietnam might cause Hanoi to slow down its infiltra-tion. However, the result of this process, at best, would be a. gradual improvement of the U.S. position without advancement toward a meaningful settlement. 87 Lacking a deliberate attempt to phase into something like "C," Option A was viewed as "an indefinite course of action." As such, its "sole advantages" were seen as '(a) defeat would be clearly due to GVN failure, and we ourselves would be less implicated than if we tried Option B or Option C, and failed; "(b) the most likely result would be a Vietnamese-negotiated deal, under which an eventually unified Communist Vietnam would reassert its traditional hostility to Communist China and limit its own ambitions to Laos and Cambodia." 88 The groups assessment went on to indicate that should this occur, Thai-land would likely conclude that "we simply could not be counted on, and would accommodate somehow to Cf mi st China even without any marked military move by Communist China." 89 The working Group reported that the actions in Option B offered a number of unique advantages relative to the other options "1. Option B probably stands a greater chance than either of the other two of attaining our objectives vis-a-vis Hanoi and a settlement in South Vietnam. "2. Our display of real muscle in action would un-doubtedly have a salutary effect on the morale of the rest of non-Communist Asia. "3- The course of military events vis-a-vis Communist China might give us a defensible case to destroy the Chinese some unique problems For example, most of Communist nuclear production capability." 90 However Option B was also seen to present and to possibly lead to some undesirable results. 28  .      . the group believed Option B would risk an impairment of the 'U.S. stand-ing in the NATO and European framework." The option was believed likely to produce a major conflict end these effects were seen as quite probable if it "produced anything less than an early and completely satisfactory outcome." 91 Problems were also perceived at home. It was pointed out that any U.S.-initiated mi 1itary pressures against North Vietnam should be consistent with the provisions of the Joint Congressional Resolution passed following the Tonkin Gulf incidents, but that Option B would be difficult to justify under the authorities cited in this resolu-tion. "Characterizing the use of force in the context of this alternative as a legitimate exercise of the right of indi-vidual or collective self-defense in response to an armed attack" from the North would be a major public relations effort." Moreover, given the pace and likely intensity of escalation in this option, it was suggested that "the constitutional prerogatives of the Congress, for example, to declare war would become pertinent." 92 As seen by the Working Group the most disturbing aspect of Option B was its almost irreversible commitment to a major military effort, the ultimate nature of which was difficult to predict. That Hanoi would yield to U.S. demands at an early stage of "B" was considered unlikely. The chances were considered "significantly greater chat vhe DRV would retaliate, either by air attacks on the South or a ground offen-sive either in Laos or into South Vietnam. It was considered most likely, however, that Hanoi would continue to hold firm, thus requiring the United States to "up the ante militarily." With further increases in our mili-tary pressure, the group argued, "the odds would necessarily start to increase that Hanoi...would either start to yield by some real actions to cut down, or would move itself to a more drastic military response." The working Group then cautioned "We could find ourselves drawn into a situation where such military actions as an amphibious landing in the DRV proposed as one of our further actions moved us very far toward continuing occupation of DRV soil. Alternatively, the volume of international noise...could reach the point where, in the interest of our world-wide objectives, we would, have to consider accepting a negotiation on terms that would relatively but not necessarily be wholly favorable to the attainment of our full objectives." 93 Option C was particularly attractive to the working Group because it was believed to be more controllable and, therefore, less deeply com-mitting than "B." Moreover, in the event of a GVN collapse (recognized as a danger under all of the options), the group argued, "our having taken stronger measures would still leave us a good deal better off than under  .      Option A with respect to the confidence and willingness to stand firm of the nations in the next line of defense in Asia.' 94 The reactions to "C" expected by the Working Group differed from "B" primarily as a result of the U.S. negotiating posture.

Tlierefore, 1 sugge additional military actions, possibly including rea r  Southeast Asia, would need to accompany the modifying moves.  The major disadvantages of Option C acknowledged by the Working Group was its tendency to "stretch-out" the confront ion an the United States to an increasing variety of pressures ' For example, the group acknowledged that GVN morale ana iwere to suffer rt several points iu 4he=ourse of the option, (1) upon initial U.S. agreement to enter negotiation, ( +Vl c clear that the war was dragging on; and (3) with mod. icaion 1 , U.S. negotiating position. It also recognized sever a measures the Communists might take during a prolonged, indecxs-ve pn reduce our initial advantage (1) improving air de enc.s in no. Vietnam; (2) deploying Chinese ground forces southward; n rening their propaganda. While increasing the enemy s pu rc to its current line of policy, these measures would no serve a acts of escalation. 96 These difficulties and other uncertainties encompassed by Option C illustrate the intensity with which most members of the NSC Working Group wanted the United States to couple limited military com-mitments with a negotiated settlement to relieve our position in Vietnam. The fact that the group judged "C" as preferable to "A" or "B," despite its rather obvious inherent problems makes this evident. (One might also ' 30        have viewed it as evidence that United States policy in Southeast. Asia was fraught with real contradictions.) For example, the one feature that gave Option "C" its most distinctive character -- early willingness to negotiate without the concurrent effects of continually mounting military pressures was its most uncertain aspect. This particular part of the analysis was revised twice between tne final, drafting of the groups findings and their consideration by the Principals. More-over, the Working Group had received at least one informed judgment, to the effect that, given Hanois high stakes in South Vietnam and its perceived opportunity to deal the United States a major blow, the DRV would not be likely to negotiate in response to any of the options. 97 On the eve of the initial meeting with the Principals, Cha-rman Bundy called early negotiations "the least satisfactory.part of the present script." In particular it was recognized as difficult to keep our show of determination and at the same time listen for nibbles. 98 In many respects Option C seems to have been favored primarily for what it incorporated for the means it employed rather chan, for what it might achieve. It certainly was not presented as an opti-mistic alternative. Under "C," the group perceived that au besc... the DRV might feign compliance and settle for an opportunity to subvert the South another day." This stood in marked contrast to whau io per-ceived as the "at best" outcome of "B," namely that Hanoi might, be ready to sit down and work out a settlement in some form thav would give a restoration of the 1954 agreements," hopefully with firmer guarantees. Moreover, with "C," the group believed that in between the best and worst outcomes, the United States "might be faced with.no. improvement, in the internal South Vietnam situation and with the difficult decision whether to escalate on up to major conflict with China. 09 This x.nd of outcome promised little more than the group perceived as available through "A" and without the additional commitment of national pres-tige and military force. But it was an outcome readily perceivable from a policy that clung tenaciously to rather major objectives but was reticent to accept major risks. 5 Views From Outside the NSC Working Group while the NSC Working Group was preparing its findings for suo-mission to the Principals, other sources of influential opinion were communicating their views to these individuals. In addrtion, it is im-portant to consider that members of the Working Group were most likely communicating their respective impressions of group progress to the principal official in the agencies they represented. Thus, William Bundy no doubt shared ideas with Secretary Rusk; John McNaughton with Secretary McNamara Harold Ford with CIA Director McCone; and Admiral Mustin with General Wheeler. Some of these Principals no doubt had injected particular ideas into the groups deliberations. Whatever the source, these high officials were exposed to a variety of suggestions and viewpoints before reacting directly to the Working Group's submissions31  .      The following sections deal with two rather significant sources of ideas whose communications reached Secretary McNama.a. However, .err views were known to other members of the Principals Group as we 1, through the normal interdepartmental coordination procedures. These proposals are significant also because of their rather coneend.mg view-points on the subject of U.S. courses of action. a. JCS Views. On four different occasions during the period of the Working Groups existence, the JCS submitted formal proposals for direct military strikes against North Vietnamese targets. On e.ch occasion they took pains to remind the Secretary of Defense and m er readers of their earlier recommendation for a preferred course o. act.on, which involved a systematic pattern of air attacks on major targe s. On 14 November, two such recommendations were made.. One was. intended to bring about expansion of the GVN's covers operations, to in-clude "air strikes by unmarked aircraft" of the VNAF. it speclfied a' these were to be "separate and distinct from larger (more decisl-ve) air strike actions recommended...on 1 November 1964." The JCS stated la such smaller attacks would be useful in (1) continuing the.pressure on the DRV; (2) encouraging GVN leaders; (3) providing useful air defense data; and (4) demonstrating patterns of DRVChinese reactions v.a cou. be helpful in planning larger operations. 100 The other recommendations came in response to Secretary McNamara's request to examine possible DRVCHICOM military reactions to U.S. air strikes against North Vietnam. In answer, they discussed various Communist military alternatives and U.S. means to counter them, and they described what they viewed.as the most likely enemy reactions. These, they felt, would be primallly in the propaganda and diplomatic spheres because of what was perceived as Chinas general reluctance to become directly involved in conflictwith the United States, In addition, the JCS repeated their recommendacions of 4 November (with respect to the VC attacks on Bien Hoa) as retaliacory actions equally applicable to any other serious provocations. ,They went on to recommend deployments "to improve capabilities to conduct the program of air strikes" recommended on 4 November l>o r. 101 Foul' days later they submitted another proposal, in response to Secretary McNamara's interest in a possible program of grae.uc-.ted U.S. pressures against North Vietnam. This possibility was described as "a controlled program of systematically increased military pressures against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) applied in coordina-tion with appropriate political pressures." (Interestingly, the Secre-tarys interest was expressed on the same day as McNaughton's reactions to the draft analysis of Option C.) The JCS referred to their statements of 4 and 14 November, describing their preferred course of action fr causing the DRV "to cease supporting and directing the insurgencies in South Vietnam and Laos. However, they also proposed an alternative series of specific actions, "should a controlled program of systematically increased pressures...be directed." Moreover, they recommended a set of operational objectives which they termed "appropriate" for such a gradu-ated program, as follows 32  .      "a. Signal the willingness and determination of the United States to employ increasing force in support of..an independent and stable noncommunist government in RVN and a free and neutral Laos "b. Reduce, progressively, DRV support of the insurgencies in RVI-; and Laos to the extent necessary to tin the balance clearly in favor of the Governments of RVN and Laos by "(1) Reduction of the amount of support available through destruction of men, material, and supporting facilities; "(2) ...and) through diversion of DRV resources to increased homeland defenses and. ale.-.ts; &.nd "(3) Reduction of the rate of delivery of available surmort through destruction of bridges ana other LOG choke points...and through rnterrup-tion of movements "c. Punish the DRV for DRV-supported military actions by the Viet CongPathet Lao "d. Terminate the conflict in Laos and RVN only under conditions which would result in the achievement of U.S. objectives." 102 The final JCS proposal to be submitted relative to the "courses of action" debate in November 1964 came in direct response co tne Working Group's draft papers, circulated to interested agencies lO. comment on 17 November". 103 Criticising the group s assessment, o. U.,. stakes and interests, the JCS called Southeast Asia an area oi major strategic importance to the United States, the loss of whicn would lead to grave political and military consequences in the entire-.es ern Pacific, and to serious political consequences world-wj.de. laey rel -erated their view that the best probability oi success in a aining y. e currently recognized U.S. objectives in that region would->e y ac ing the prerequisite objective of causing the cessation o. DRV suppox u and direction of the insurgencies in RVN and Laos, 104 The JCS also criticized the three options described by uhe Woln.-ing Group and outlined five alternatives to them, in tn asccndmg 01 er of intensity 1. Terminate commitments in South Vietnam and Laos and withdraw as gracefully as possible. The JCS called this "implicit in the content of the ESC working Group paper but...not clearly identified as a separate and distinct option." 33        2. Continue actions contained within present policies, mclud-ing reprisals for VC provocations. The JCS identif-ed ..is c.s e groups Option A but stated that the added demands it placec on the DRV were "not commensurate with those imposed by DRV or RVN. n essence, they agreed with the Working Groups evaluation that this a elnanive would neither accomplish our objectives nor alleviate the cri ica situation in South Vietnam. 3- Undertake graduated military and political initiatives no apply additional pressures against the DRV, without necessarily determining in advance to what degree we will commit ourselves to achieve ouro -jectives, or at what point we might scop onego tiate, or what our negotiating objectives might, be. The JCS stated that this alternative corresponded to the NSC working Groups Option C, which they criticized for its uncertain pace ana because it did not include "a clear determination to see things through in full." They argued that such an "inconclusive option could permi and encourage enemy build-ups to counter our own, and thus cls--risks and costs to us of each separate military underuaua-ng. 4.

In particular, they specified that their m-tensive program would be undertaken on the basis that it be carried through, if necessary, to the full limat of what military actions can contribute toward national ob-jectives; it would be designed, however, -or sus-pension short of those limits if objectives were earlier achieved. For a full description of this alternative, they referred to their pro-posal of 14 November. 105 Of the five alternatives, the JCS stated their beliefthat only the last two offered "a probability of achieving current U.S, objectives.  .

He then, repeated his prescription of military moves e-r Pff, not Secretary McNamara. However; he stressed that these moves would not, "in themselves, constitute a decisive signal. MoreXeSon Communist eyes, he felt, would be signals to ans.r. "Is the President of the United States deeply to reinstalling the 1954-62 Accords; or por eSsen-a demonstration of force that would eave . tially a U.S. political defeat at a drplomatrc con.crence. 109 In Rostovs view, the Communists would not maantbusiness they were absolutely certain that the Unie comnit- an assessment that could only come as a lesu -- 1. ments on the part of the President and appropriate o tow .

But it will take that kind of Presidential commit-ment and staying power." Acknowleding that the kind of conflict we facedlent itself to prolonged uncertainties and that the Communists could prevend to call o guerrilla war, only to revive it again, he stressed the need to maintarn pressure on them for some time. The installation o groun orce "non-sanguinary" naval blockade were suggested as partlcular ye 36  .      this purpose. Rostow urged trying "to gear this whole operation with the best counterinsurgency effort we can mount with our Vietnamese friends... and not withdraw U.S. forces from Viet Nam until the war is truly under control." 110 In closing, Rostow outlined a scenario of action that would follow from, the kind of Presidential decision described above. This would include, in sequence (1) Immediate movement of relevant forces to tne Pacific. (2) Immediate direct communication to Hanoi...including a clear statement of the limits 01 cur objectives but our absolute commitment to them. (3) Should this first communication fail (as is likely) installation of our ground forces and naval blockade, plus first attack in North, to be accompanied by publication of a report on infiltration and Presidential speech. 111 Thus, in their communications to senior officials in tne latter half 01 November, both Walt Rostow and the JCS stressed a similar point. Al-though advocating different solutions, they both emphasized that the Administration could not expect to dissuade Hanoi and Peking from con-tinued pursuit of the DRV's"important and strongly-held commitments without making correspondingly strong commitments to resist them. The JCS, for their own reasons, sought to avoid a commitment of ground forces to Vietnam and argued instead for punitive air and naval actions. Rostow felt that by forceful and meaningful demonstrations o. national resolve, including the commitment of ground forces to South Vietnam, direct use of force against the Communist nations need be minimal. 37  .      II. POLICY DECISIONS The efforts of the NSC Working Group were intended to be completed in preparation for a major policy review late in November l- ans were made for Ambassador Taylor to return to Washington from a on o join in a series of strategy meetings. The expectations were c. a e meetings would result in a Presidential action order to supersede the one issued following the high-level conference in September (NSAM 3 ) Meetings with the President were scheduled for the week following Thanksgiving, when he returned from his working holiday at the <9; Preliminary meetings between Ambassador Taylor and tne pnncipa -1 from agencies with national security interests in Southeast Asia were held during the preceding weekend, 27-29 November, ihe jmo <- epiu.o e took place amid widespread speculation that a major policy c .-uge yao imminent and rumors that Taylor had returned to insist on the comb mg of infiltration targets in North Vietnam and Laos. Public and Congress-ional speculation ran so high on the eve of the meetings that the V. i e House and State Department sought to dampen it with statements a Taylors reported comments "were not policy" and that his return di no mean that "any great, horrendous decision1' would result. 11 1. Reactions of Principals to Working Group Analyses Before their meetings with Taylor and the President, the Prin-cipals in Washington met to consider the Working Group's findings ana to assess the major issues affecting future U.S. courses of actlon. Jus prior to their initial gathering, on 24 November, william Bdy r-warded a list of questions and comments pertaining to the working Group s findings, and these served as a kind of agenda. Included were such lssues as (1) whether the relative advantages among the three options teie actually as evident as the group had found; (2) whether or not the papers assessment of U.S. stakes in Southeast Asia should be revised in the direction of JCS attitudes; (3) whether the actions associated uith the various options could in fact be carried out to achieve tne results ex-pected; and (4) whether a deployment of ground forces to south Vietnam would in fact provide any advantages. 113 (TAB A) a. Consensus .Among NSC Officials. As the Principals meeting. opened, Secretary Rusk raised an issue that was high among .Administration concerns -- namely that the American public was worried about the chaos in the GVN, and particularly with respect to its viability as an object of an increased U.S. commitment. Secretary McNamara arid General Wheeler conceded the propriety of this concern but warned that the situation in the GVN would only get worse if additional steps were not caken to reverse present trends. Rusk then presented a question which seemed basic to the  .      whole rationale for contemplated U.S. courses of action. He asked whether the situation in South Vietnam could be improved in time to save it if the DRV were now to withdraw its support. CIA Director McCone conceded that the VC would still have plenty of capability remaining but expressed the view that the situation could be coped with from the standpoint of internal security criteria. At this point Under Secretary of State George Ball asked if bombing North Vietnam could improve the situation in South Vietnam directly. McNamara replied that it could not unless the bombing actually cut down the infiltration into the South. After agreeing with a Rusk comment that the struggle would be a long one, even with the DRV out of it, the group reached consensus that South Vietnam could be made secure, provided the Saigon government could maintain itself. 114 This was the first of several major policy judgments reached in the course of the meeting. Other points of clear consensus (with no more than a single dissenting opinion) were as follows (2) That the situation in South Vietnam would deteriorate further under Option A even with reprisals, but that there was a "significant chance" that the actions proposed under "B" or "C" would result in an improved GVN performance and "make possible" an improved security situation (George Ball indicated doubt). (3) That any negotiating outcome under Option A (with or without U.S. negotiating participation) probably would be clearly worse than under Option B or C. (4) That it was doubtful (contrary to the view expressed in the Working Group papers) that Option B would have the best chance of achieving the full U.S. objectives (General Wheeler expressed agreement with the working Group statement). (5) That the requirement of Option C, "that we maintain a credible threat of major action while at the same time seeking to negotiate," could be carried out despite acknowledged public pressures. (6) That the Administration could safely assume that South Vietnam could "only come apart for morale reasons, and not in a military sense," as a result of intensified VC effort. (7) That early military actions against North Vietnam under Option C should be determined, but low in scale that at this stage, strong damaging actions ' 39  .      should be limited to reprisals (General Wheeler dis-sented, stating that our losses might be higher in the long run with such an approach). (8) That the loss of South Vietnam would be more serious than stated in Section II of the Working Group's draft papers and that the A.dministration's assessment should be revised at least in the direction of the JCS viewpoint (George Ball argued against this judgment). 115 The context of the Principals' discussion of this last point contained some significant expressions of opinion. Secretary Rusk stated the viewpoint that the confidence of other nations in the United States would be affected by the loss of South Vietnam despite their possible indifference to the political struggle in Southeast Asia. He added that if we did nothing to affect the course of events'in Vietnam it would have the effect of giving more to de Gaulle. However, Rusk did not accept the Working Group's rationale that we would obtain international credit merely for trying. In his view, the harder we tried and then failed, the worse our situation would be. McC-eorge Bundy disagreed with this last point, except to acknowledge that to attempt something like Option B and then quit would clearly be damaging. Secretary McNamara seemed to support the (McGeorge) Bundy view, stating that "B" followed by failure would clearly be worse than Option C followed by a compromise settlement. George Ball expressed strong agreement with the last Rusk point, saying that de Gaulle would portray us as being foolish and reiterating that the damage to U.S. prestige would be worse if we tried either "B" or "C" and failed. General Wheeler stated the opinion that to do little or nothing at this point would be an act of bad faith. Mr. McCone pointed out a perpetual dilemma if the Administration continued to act despite South Vietnamese deterioration; hence, he urged great care. 116 It is interesting to note the views and associations of the two occasional dissenters in the series of consensus judgments rendered by the Principals. General Wheeler, Chairman of the JCS, expressed view-points consistent throughout with the recorded JCS views on future courses of action. Or. the other hand, George Ball, Under Secretary of State, had no obvious jurisdictional or institutional influences to affect his judg-ments. nevertheless, known to Administration observers as "the devil's advocate," he had developed something of a reputation as an independent thinker. At about the time of the Working Group deliberations, for example, he developed a paper suggesting U.S. diplomatic strategy in the event of an imminent GVN collapse. In it, he advocated working through the U.K., who would in turn seek cooperation from the USSR, in arranging an international conference (of smaller proportions than those at Geneva) at which to work out a compromise political settlement for South Vietnam. 117 In addition, Ball's prevalent occupation with European affairs may have influenced him to view Southeast Asia as of lesser importance to the U.S. national interest. H 40  .      b. Views Lacking Consensus. Also discussed at the 24 November Principals meeting were several issues on which consensus was not reached. Most of these related to immediate U.S. actions that would need to be taken irrespective of the option selected, or to problems faced in carry-ing out a particular option. Since earlier agreements had indicated little interest in Option A, only "B" end "C" were examined further. Discussions of Option B dealt primarily wxth questions of the intensity of blows that might be struck at North Vietnam. With respect to whether DRV airfields should be struck early or as a part.of a more gradual sequence, General Wheeler pointed out that early strikes on air-fields were what made "B" operations so different. It was these strikes at potential DRV capabilities to interfere with J.S. attacks, or to retaliate, that made systematic, intensive air operations possible. In response to a specific question from the Working Group, the possibl ivy of using nuclear weapons was also discussed. Secretary Me amura s a e that he could not imagine a case where they would be considered. McGeorge Bundy observed that under certain circumstances there might be grea pressure for their use both from the military and from certain politica . circles. General Wheeler stated that he would not normally vote for their use never, for example, in an interdiction role. However, he sugges e that they might be considered in extremis for example, to hold off an enemy to save a force threatened with destruction, or co knocx. ou special target like a nuclear weapons facility. In response to Secretary Rusk's query as to their potential for cordoning oif an area, Loth McNamara and Wheeler answered negatively. 118 Discussions of Option C dealt with the problem of early negotia-tions and, at greater length, with that of deploying ground forces.to South Vietnam. On the former, there was little interchange noted in the proceedings. Despite the Working Group's admitted frustration wit ls particular issue, only two Principals' comments were recorded. McGeorge Bundy stated the view that we should let negotiations come into play slowly. Secretary Rusk expressed concern that the Gn would be very sensitive on the issue of a negotiating conference, earlier, however, he indicated his opinion that pressure for a conference would not be a serious problem as long as military actions continued. 119 On the issue of sending ground forces to South Vietnam in the early stages of Option C, there was no firm conclusion. Secretary McNamara stated that there was no military requirement for ground forces and that he would prefer a massive air deployment. In response to General Wheeler's suggestion that some ground forces coull be justifie for air defense and base security purposes, he acknowledged that we might do both." Mr. McCone stated the opinion that U.S. ground forces would help stabilize South Vietnam, similar to their effect.on Lebanon, in 1958. They might even provide a general security force in the South. McNamara disagreed. Secretary Rusk and McGeorge Bundy suggested their utility in proving a "preemptive effect," presumably to deter North Vietnamese offensive moves into the South. To this McCone added that 41        these forces might be equipped in ways to show our determination. In the end, it was agreed to raise this issue with Ambassador Taylor, at the Principals next meeting. Significantly, the value of ground forces as a bargaining counter apparently was not discussed, thus providing one more indication of the Principals reticence to deal with the issue of negotiations. (It is interesting to note in this respect that william Bundy's memorandum, formally summarizing the points of consensus and disagreement, does not deal with the early negotiating problem --despite its being a specific agenda item which he had suggested as Chairman of the Working Group.) 120 The only basic issue between the options on which the Principals did not arrive at a consensus was the question of the relative risks of major conflict entailed by Options B and C. General Wheeler stated that there was less risk of a major conflict before achieving success under Option B than under Option C. Secretary McNamara believed the opposite to be true. Secretary Rusk argued that if "B" were selected, there would be no chance to apply the JCS variant of "C," whereas under the Working Group's "C," this would still be left available. He observed that entry into the JCS variant of "C" would feel something like the Cuban issile risis. MoTfamara. then suggested a four-week program of actions following the general pattern of Option C. Mr. McCone stated that they sounded "fine," but that in his opinion the "negotiating mood" interfered with their potential effects. He agreed to attempt a paper to deal more directly with the relation of risk to likely success, as between the two options. In the end, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that there was not complete agreement that "B" ran a higher risk of major conflict than "C," as alleged by the Working Group. 121 During the meeting of 24 November there was no clear decision as to which option was favored by the Principals. It seems likely that "A" was favored by Ball. Wheeler clearly favored "B," and he may have had support from McCone, although this is far from clear. On the basis of either their participation in the Working Group or from statements of preference made at the meeting, it is clear that "C" was favored by McNamara, McNaughton, Rusk, and the Bundy brothers. However McGeorge Bundy and McNamara apparently preferred a "firm C," whereas the other three wanted a more restrained, incremental approach. 122 c. Policy Views from Saigon. The same group of Principals that met on the 24th re-assembled on 27 November for their first meet-ing with Ambassador Taylor. Present also was Michael Forrestal who had gone to Saigon to help prepare Taylor for the forthcoming strategy meet-ings and to apprise him of the Working Group efforts. 123 Taylor led off with a prepared briefing on the current state of affairs within South Vietnam. Ambassador Taylors estimate of the situation in South Vietnam was rather bleak. Confirming many of the assessments made weeks earlier 42  I .      in intelligence estimates, he reported continued deterioration of the pacification program and continued weakness in the central government. The former was portrayed as related to increased direction and support of VC operations from Hanoi and increasing VC strength despite "very heavy losses inflicted almost daily" by the ARVN. Particular areas of concern were identified as the area surrounding Saigon and the northern provinces, which were "now in deep trouble." Taylor related GVN weakness to political factionalism, mounting war weariness and hopelessness, "particularly in the urban areas," and a lack of "team play or mutual loyalty" among many central and provincial officials. Calling such chronic weakness "a critical liability to future plans," he warned that lack of an effective central government caused U.S. efforts to assist South Vietnam to have little impact. 124 To alter the course of what Taylor called "a losing game in South Vietnam," he recommended three measures (1) "establish an adequate government"; (2) improve the counterinsurgency effort; and (3) "persuade or force the DRV" to stop aiding and directing the insurgency. With respect to the first, Taylor allowed that it was "hard to decide what is the minimum government which is necessary to permit reasonable hope" of success. However, he stated "...it is hard to visualize our being willing to make added outlays of resources and to rm increasing political risks without an allied government which, at least, can speak for and to its people, can maintain law and order in the principal cities, can provide local protection for the vital military bases and installations, can raise and support Armed Forces, and can gear its efforts to those of the United States. Anything less than this would hardly be a government at all, and under such circumstances, the United States Government might do better to carry forward the war on a purely unilateral basis. With regard to the counterinsurgency effort, he opined, We cannot do much better than what we are doing at present until the government improves." 125 Ambassador Taylor saw U.S. military actions directed at the DRV as fulfilling a twofold purpose. On the one hand, he believed that even if an effective government were established, "we will not succeed in the end unless we drive the DRV out of its reinforcing role and obtain its cooper-ation in bringing an end to the Viet Cong insurgency. On the other hand, he saw actions outside South Vietnam as a means to improve C-VL morale and confidence. Acknowledging that using our aid, advice and encouragement on behalf of programs to stabilize the government would probably be insuf-ficient for this purpose, he suggested additional measures "One way to accomplish this lift of morale would be to increase the covert operations against North Viet ham by sea 43 .      and air and the counterinfiltration attacks within the Laotian corridor. While the former would be covert...knowledge of their occurrence could be made known...to give the morale lift which is desired. Additionally we could engage in reprisal bombings, to repay outrageous acts of the Viet Cong in South . Viet Nam" However, he added that even all these actions might not be sufficient "to hold the present government upright," in which case we would have to reconsider our policies. Our alternatives, he said, would be either to support one form or another of a replacement government or to "limit our contribution to military action directed at North Viet-Nam." 126 In addition to the military actions already identified with morale-raising purposes, Taylor suggested  "...we could begin to escalate progressively by attack-ing appropriate targets in North Viet-Nam. If we justified our action primarily upon the need to reduce infiltration, it would be natural to direct these attacks on infiltration-related targets such as staging areas, training facilities, communications centers and the like In its final forms, this kind of attack could extend to the destruction of all important fixed targets in North Viet-Nam and to the interdiction of movement on all lines of communication. 127 Ambassador Taylor's views regarding the circumstances under which such escalatory actions should be initiated were not entirely clear in his briefing to the Principals. After reiterating the necessity of stepping up the 34A operations, increasing those in Laos, and undertaking reprisals as part of the efforts to raise morale and strengthen the GVN, he stated two somewhat different, although not necessarily contradictory, viewpoints on the question of stronger military actions "If this course of action is inadequate, and the government falls, then we must start over again or try a new approach In any case, we should be prepared for emergency military action against the North if only to shore up a collapsing situation. "if, on the other hand...the government maintains and proves itself, then we should be prepared to embark on a methodical program of mounting air attacks in order to accomplish our pressure objectives vis-a-vis the DRV" He then proposed a scenario for controlled escalation, the actions in which were quite similar to an extended Option A or a low-order Option C without declared negotiating willingness. 128 . 44  .      . The impression is that Taylor visualized graduated airopera-tions having primarily psychological impact on the Lorth following logically from successful political efforts in the South but that he also wanted an (perhaps somewhat stronger) air campaign held in . readiness as a punitive measure in the event of a critical re versa xn the South. This impression is strengthened by his earlier commen about U.S. alternatives and by the second of "three principles w ic he recommended to the Principals "a. Do not enter into negotiations until the DRV is hurting. "b. Never let the DRV gain a victory.in South Viet-Nam without having paid a disproportionate price. "c. Keep the GVN in the forefront of the combat and the negotiations." 129 Involving the GVN in all phases of our operations was an im-portant aspect of the Ambassador's thinking about next courses o. action. He stressed that before making a final decision on the course r-e t.ou follow, it would be necessary to obtain the reactions of Prime Minister Huong and General Khanh to our various alternatives. He explained "They will be taking on risks as great or greater than ours so that they have a right to a serious hearing, .e should make every effort to get them to ask our help in expanding the war. If they decline, we shall have to re-think the whole situation." "If, as is likely, they urge us," Taylor added, we should take advantage of their enthusiasm "to nail down certain important points. on which we want their agreement. Included were GVN pledges to main earn ml 1 ary and police strength, to replace incompetent officials, and o suppress disorder and agreements to stipulated divisions of responsibility or conducting military operations. 130 Taylor's briefing made clear his commitment to limited U.S. ob-jectives in Southeast Asia and his believe in the necessi y or assuring the DRV of this limitation. Further, he made explicit his expectation that the DRV would not accept U.S. offensive actions without some inten-sified military reaction in the South and that any DRV submission to our demands might well be temporary. d. Discussions with Ambassador Taylor. Following the briefing, the Principals commented on a number of the Ambassador s observations and discussed further the question of future courses of action. ecre ary Rusk asked what could be done to make the GVN perform better. Tayor replied that he must be able to convey a strong message but that v.e ' .      couldn't threaten the Saigon government. For example, a threat to "withdraw unless" would be "quite a gamble." The issue of neutralism was raised and "Ambassador Taylor noted that neutralism' as it existed in Saigon appeared to mean throwing the internal political situation open and thus inviting Communist participation." Mr. Ball observed that a neutralist state could not be maintained unless the VC were defeated and that the GVN must continue to be free to receive external aid until that occurred. Therefore, "neutralism in the sense of with-drawal of external assistance" did not seem to be a hopeful alternative. In apparent reply to Taylors briefing comments to the effect that the United States might continue military action against North Vietnam de-spite a GVN collapse, Rusk commented that he "couldn't see a unilateral war" in this event. Taylor indicated that be meant "only punitive actions." Secretary McNamara. agreed with Rusk, but added that if the GVN continued to weaken we would need to try Option C dr A. "The con-sensus was that it. was hard to visualize continuing in these circum-stances if the GVN collapsed or told us to get out, but that the choice must certainly be avoided if at all possible." 131 After a discussion of some of the administrative problems in the GVN, "Ambassador Taylor noted that General Westmoreland had pre-pared a report of the military situation" in South Vietnam. (The report was later distributed to the group.) He indicated that "Westmoreland was generally more optimistic than he (Taylor)" and that he saw better morale, increased defections and the like as signs of improvement in the military situation. Further, he stated that Westmoreland would be inclined to wait six months before taking further actions in order to have a firmer base for them. However, Taylor added that "he himself did not believe that we could count on the situation holding together that long, and that we must do something sooner than this." Secretary McNamara also disagreed with Westmorelands view, expressing doubts that the military situation would improve. In answer to specific questions, McNamara stated his opinions that (1) no, the political situation would not become stronger, but (2) yes, we would be justified in undertaking Option C even if the political situation did not improve. Taylor replied that "stronger action would definitely have a favorable effect" in South Vietnam, "but he was not sure this would be enough really to improve the situation." Others, including McNamara, agreed with Taylor's evaluation, but the Secretary added that "the strengthening effect of Option C could at least buy time, possibly measured in years." Ambassador Taylor then urged that "over the next two months we adopt a program of Option A plus the first stages of Option C." He argued that the GVN was badly in need of some "pulmotor treatment," that any other alternative would probably result in a worsened situation perhaps militarily. He added that the likelihood of GVN improvement seemed so doubtful that "we should move into C right away." Secretary Rusk asked if Option C would give Taylor the "bargaining leverage" 46        needed with the GVN. The Ambassador replied by suggesting certain details of the message he would propose passing to the Saigon government. In effect these called for the GVN to agree, to the kind of internal policies and command arrangements suggested in his briefing, in return for a prompt U.S. implementation of "Option A plus" and acknowledgment of the intention to go further if the GVN stabilized itself. 133 It is important to note that the official memorandum of the foregoing discussion implies agreement among the Principals that Option A plus early stages of C should be recommended. The memorandum states, "It was urged that ... and 'to get what improvements we could it was thought that we should move into some parts of C soon." There followed a discussion of the infiltration evidence, during which Mr. McCone indicated that an intelligence team had made a further investigation of it. "It was agreed that State and Defense should check statements made by Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, and General Wheeler on this subject, so that these could be related to the previous MACV and other estimates and a full explanation . developed of how these earlier estimates had been made and why they had been wrong in the light of fuller evidence." 134 Before the meeting adjourned (with agreement to meet again the next day), Ambassador Taylor raised a number of questions which he thought the Working Group papers had not covered adequately (TAB B). Only a few received answers during the meeting, and he agreed to furnish the Principals with the complete list. However, it was indicated that Option B or C could be initiated from a "standing start" -- presumably with no incidents necessarily occurring first. The GVN were acknowledged to have "plenty of capabilities" to participate even before arriving at the intended four-squairon strength of A-l aircraft. It was stressed that the VNAF role would be in North Vietnam only not in Laos -- and Secretary McNamara indicated a strong role for them against targets below the l9th Parallel. Finally, a time-span of three to six months was indicated as the expected duration for Option C. 135 On the following day, when the Principals reassembled, William Bundy circulated a draft scenario of actions proposed in the event a decision were made to undertake measures like those contained in Option A. It had been agreed at the end of the initial meeting that these would be reviewed by the group with the assumption that they could be imp!e-mented "with or without a decision to move into the full Option C program at some time thereafter." 136 (It is important to note how readily the attention of the Principals focused on the similarity of preparatory actions and early military measures in the various options, apparently without regard to the particular negotiating rationale which each option incorporated.) Bundys scenario of early military, political and diplomatic actions was base! on a similar assumption "that a decision is or is not going to be7 taken to go on with Option C thereafter if Hanoi does  .      not bend or the GVN come apart." He indicated, however, that the Working Group believed "that at least a. contingent decision to go on is now re-quired." To facilitate discussion on the part of the Principals, work-sheets indicating proposed language or procedures were distributed, to include the following action categories. 137 1. U.S. public action a. White House statement following 1 December meeting b. Background briefing on infiltration c. Congressional consultation d. Major Presidential speech e. Public report on infiltration 2. Consultation with the GVN 3. Consultation with key allies 4. Communications with Communist nations 5. Existing forms of military actions (including reconnaissance and RLAF strikes in Laos, GVN maritime operations, etc.) 6. Reprisal actions resulting from DE SOTO Patrols and "spectaculars" 7- Added military and other actions Certain of these topics received more attention than others in the course of the meeting, with emphasis being placed on "spelling out" the exact steps that the Principals would be asking the President to approve. With respect to actions aimed at the U.S. public, McGeorge Bundy stressed that the Presidential speech must both (1) affirm U.S. determination and (2) be consistent with the infiltration evidence. General Wheeler stated that earlier infiltration reports could be defended because of their small data base and suggested that the discrepancies could be used to explain how the VC operated. It was determined that one man should be put in charge of assembling the available infiltration data for public release, and Chester Cooper was suggested for the job. With respect to coordination with the C-VN, Ambassador Taylor pointed out the need to prepare a draft statement to the GVN for the Presidents review and agreed to prepare a table of the specific GVN actions needed. Secretary Rusk acknowledged the possible desirability of delaying until GVN leadership issues were resolved, but that "anything now would cause problems." Mr. Ball reminded that it would be necessary to query the , GVN regarding release of some of the infiltration evidence.133 48        Military and other related actions were also discussed Secretary Rusk indicated the need to surface the GVN maritime operations, and Ambassador Taylor suggested that they and other morale-raising ac-tions could be made public "in one package.1' In discussing the possible need for additional airfields in the northern part of South Vietnam, it was pointed out that a new jet field might take two years. Secretary McNamara said he thought there were enough fields to supperu Option C now if certain readily accessible improvements were added. Jie and the generals (Wheeler and Taylor) reminded the group that stopping the move-ment of U.S. dependents to South Vietnam or withdrawing those already there could not be concealed and that this problem must re resolved promptly -- certainly within the initial 30 days. Taylor cautioned tha actions regarding dependents could not be taken until our full course was decided, presumably because of potential GV. fears of a Uwi drawal. The question of resumed DE SOTO Patrols was raised wi e reminder that CINCPAC wanted them for intelligence purposes. Taylor, McNamara and McGeorge Bundy opposed the idea, while General Nhee er strongly supported it. Motesof the meeting indicate resolutlon to the effect that the patrols should not be resumed during the first 30-day period. It was also agreed to recommend joint U. SGVH planning of reprisal actions and of further escalatory measures. 139 At some point during the meeting it was determined that William Bundy would undertake preparation of a draft national security ac ion paper containing policy guidance for the approaching period- the paper was to describe the strategic concept, outline the actions o e a'en during the initial 3O-day period, and indicate likely follow-on measures and the conditions under which they might be implemented. It was ecine that the paper would be reviewed at another meeting of the Pnnclpa s on 30 November, before submission to the President. A white House meetmg had been scheduled for the following day. 140 On the afternoon of the 30th, in Secretary Rusks conference room, the Principals met again. Bundys draft paper had been dis n-buted to them earlier after being generally approved (re format) by Rus. and reviewed for substance by Messrs. McNaughton and Forrestal. li In describing the basic concept, the paper presented U.S. objec-tives as "unchanged," although giving primary emphasis to our aims in South Vietnam. However, getting the DRV to remove its support and dlrec-tion from the insurgency in the South, and obtaining their cooperation in ending VC operations there, were listed among the basic objectives not presented as a strategy for attaining them. The objectives were ' to be pursued in the first 30 days by measures including those contained in Option A, plus U.S. armed route reconnaissance operations in Laos. They were linked with Ambassador Taylors rationale that these actions would be intended primarily "to help GVN morale and to increase the costs and strain on Hanoi." The concept also included Taylor's emphasis on        pressing the GVN to make itself more effective and to push forward its pacification efforts. For the period beyond the first 30 days, ne concept provided that "...fiist-phase actions may be continued without change, or additional military measures may be taken including the withdrawal of dependents and the possible initiation of strikes a short distance across the border agams e infiltration routes from the DRV. In the latter case this would become a transitional phase." 142 The kind of actions that the transition would lead to were de-scribed in a carefully qualified manner "...if the GVN improves its effectiveness to an acceptable degree and Hanoi does not yield on acceptable eras, or 1 the GVN can only be kept going by stronger action, the U.S. is prepared -- at a time to be determined-- o en ei ur a second phase program...of graduated military pressures directed systematically against the DRV. The concept continued with a mixture of suggested actions and rationale similar to that in Option C. The air strikes would be progressive y more serious" and "adjusted to the situation." The expected duration was indicated as "possibly running from two to six months. Targets in the DRV.would start with infiltration targetssouth of the l9th Parallel and work up to targets north of that point. The approve . would be steady and deliberate, to give the United States the option "to proceed or not-, to escalate or not, and to quicken the pace or not. It concluded with the following "Concurrently, the U.S. would be alert to any sign of yielding by Hanoi, and would be prepared to explore negotiated solutions that attain U.S. objectives in an acceptable manner. The U.S. would seek to control any negotiations and would oppose any independent South Vietnamese efforts to negotiate." 143 Bundy's draft NSAM also included a summation of the recommended JCS alternative concept and a brief description of the various military, political and diplomatic measures to be taken during the first 30 lays following implementation of the concept. Significantly, the latter included reprisal actions "preferably within 24 hours" for a wide range of specified VC provocations. It also contained a specific provision that DE SOTO Patrols would not be resumed during the initial 30-day period, but would be considered for the follow-on period. In the documents available there was no record of the proceed-ings of the meeting on 30 November. The only evidence available was 50  .      the notations appearing on the original draft NSAM, filed with other papers from the NSC Working Group at the State Department. .therefore, the following assessment of what occurred is limited to inferences from that sparse evidence. Moreover, based on this evidence, it is not absolutely certain that the changes indicated came as a result of the Principals meeting. Several changes apparently were made in order not to ask the President to commit himself unnecessarily (e.g., the language was changed from "take" to "resume" a specific action in the second phase to "be prepared to take," etc.). Others had policy implications. The only significant change in the first category was to remove any reference in the title to NSAM and to call it merely a "position paper." In the latter category, several changes seem significant. For example, keeping the GVN going through the effects of stronger U.S. action was deleted as one of the circumstances under which we might initiate a program of "graduated military pressures" against the DRV. Apparently based on Secretary McNamaras comment, reference to the United States seeking to control the negotiations and blocking South Vietnamese efforts in this direction was removed. The summary of JCS views was also removed from the concept, in effect presenting a united front to the President. From the description of 30-day actions, all reference to the intent to pub-licize infiltration evidence or present it to allied and Congressional leaders was eliminated, including the intention to link reprisal actions to DRV infiltration to develop "a common thread of justification." Also removed was reference to a major Presidential speech, apparently on the advice of McGeorge Bundy. 144 Although there is a bare minimum of rationale or explanation for these changes in the available evidence, the pattern descrl e y the changes themselves is significant. In effect, Option A a ong wi . the lowest order of Option C actions were being recommenced y -e . Principals in a manner that would represent the least possible additional commitment. This represented a considerable softening of t e posx ions held at the end of the first Principals meeting, on the 24th. It also represented a substantial deviation from the findings of the Working Group. It will be recalled that the group conceded Option A little chance of contributing to an improved GVn and. saw i s likely impact on South Vietnamese morale as no more lasting than the effects of the Tonkin Gulf reprisals. Moreover, even extended A vas believed "at best" to be capable of little more than an improved U.S. position -- certainly not of a meaningful settlement. 15In effect, the Principals were returning to the initial concept of Option C held in the Working Group by Bundy, Johnson and McNaughton but without. i e initially flexible attitude toward national interest and objectives m Southeast Asia. 51  .      It is important to consider the factors that may have brought about the change. (1) It may have resulted as a reaction to the persuasiveness of General Taylor's arguments. (2) It may have repre-sented a genuine mellowing of individual viewpoints after the oppor-tunity to consider other judgments and weigh .11 the factors. (3) It may have resulted from the Principals' uneasiness with the negotiating track included in Option C. (4) It may have reflected concern over public pressure for harsher measures that could have resulted from too much public emphasis on the increased infiltration. (5) It nay have represented an attempt to enhance the chances of the President's. approving some kind of stepped uo U.S. action outside of South Vietnam. With regard to the latter, McGeorge Bundy, as the Presidents Assistant for National Security Affairs, was in a position to convey President Johnson's mood to the group. Moreover, notes taken at the White House meeting tend to confirm that the Presidents mood was more closely akin to the measures recommended than to those in Option B or full Option C. Then again, it may be that all of these factors operated on the Prin-cipals in some measure. Also significant, in the series of discussions held by the Principals, was their apparent lack of attention to the policy issues related to negotiations. Despite the fact that Option C measures were stipulated for the second phase of U.S. actions, the early negotiating posture intended to accompany that option was apparently paid little heed. According to the meeting notes, the only reference to our bar-gaining capability was Secretary Rusk's concern as to whether Option C actions would enable Ambassador Taylor to bargain in Saigon. Among the documents from the Principals meetings, the only reference to Hanoi's interest in negotiating occurred in Bundys draft NSAM, where he re-flected apparent Administration expectations that after more serious pressures were applied the DRV would move first in the quest for a settlement. 146 In retrospect, the Principals appear to have assumed rather low motivation on the part of the DRV. Either this or they were overly opti-mistic regarding the threat value of U.S. military might, or both. For example, Ambassador Taylor's perception of how a settlement might be reached -- which apparently produced little unfavorable reaction among the others -- indicated the assumption that DRV concessions to rather major demands could be obtained with relatively weak pressures. In his suggested scenario (acknowledged as "very close" to the concept accepted by the Principals), 147 the U.S. negotiating posture accom-panying a serie.1 of attacks, limited to infiltration targets "just north of the DMZ," was intended to be as follows "...in absence of public statements by DRV, initiate no public statements or publicity by ourselves or GVi. If DRV does make public statements, confine ourselves and 52  .      GVN to statements that GVN is exercising right of self-defense and we are assistingdisclose to selected allies, and possibly USSR, U.S.GVN terms for cessation of attacks as follows A. Demands 1. DRV return to strict observance of 1954 Accords with respect SVN -- that is, stop infiltration and bring about a cessation of VC armed insurgency. B. In return 1. U.S. .will return to 1954 Accords with respect to military personnel in GVN and GVN would be willing to enter into trade talks looking toward normalization of economic relations between DRV and GVN. 2. Subject to faithful compliance by DRV with 1954 Accords, U.S. and GVN would give assurances that they not use force or support the use of force by any other party to upset the Accords with respect to the DRV. 3. ...the GVN would permit VC desiring to do so to return to the DRV without their arms or would grant amnesty..." Taylor went on to suggest that "if tance the United States should avoid (1) the g conditions so accompanied by prolonged negotiations and (2)S stringent" as to be impracticable. 148 Significantly, the terms were to be conveyed to Hanoi privately. They did not constitute a declaratory policy in the 1 0the DRV term. Hence, it must be assumed that they noneJ- with the attitude of "acceptance or else"that they Per ceived primarily as conveying a firm public im & ' .. radu- were designed to accompany what became known as P ; ,'  ated pressures of Opti'on Cnot the 30-lay actions derived from Option A. They were meant to represent the ear y n . Li.+.pA with or the United Statesnot the "no-negotlation" posture associated with Option A. Titis general attitude toward negotiations was apparently shared by other Principals. This is indicated by changes made in Option C procedures, in the Summary of the Working Group's findings, following        the first Principals meeting. Essentially, the -..

Even then, one migh no in a clear-cut decision recorded. However, from handwritten notes o . e meeting, from instructions issued to action agencies,.and  er reports of diplomatic and military actions taken, it is possi e. o reconstruct the approximate nature of the discussion and ce ecrsions reached. The revised "Draft Position Paper on Southeast Asia," contain-ing the two-phase concept for future U.S. policy and the proposed 30-day action program, provided the basis for the White House discussions. Handwritten notes of the proceedings refer to various topics in apprcxi-mately the same order as they are listed in that portion of the position paper dealing with the 30-day action program. There is no indication that the over-all concept was discussed. However, it is evident from the notes that the various actions under discussion were considered in terms of the details of their implementation. 151 This fact together with the content of the formal instructions later issued to 54.  .      Ambassador Taylor make it clear that, in general outline at least, the concept submitted by the Principals was accepted by the President. However, as will be seen, it is also clear that he gave his approval to implement only the first phase of the concept. In addition to Ambassador Taylor's report, the meeting dealt mainly with two subjects (1) Taylor's consultations with South 7let-namese leaders and (2) conversations with other U.S. allles v. o .a- an interest in the Vietnamese situation. The President made it clear that he considered that PRl? the South Vietnamese together was basic to anytning e- se . e uni e States might do. He asked the Ambassador specifically which groups he might talk to and what more we might do to help bring uni y among South Vietnam's leaders. He asked whether we could not say o em "we just can't go on" unless they pulled together, Io replied that we must temper our insistence somewhat., an sugge- e we could say that "our aid is for the Huong government, not necessary y for its successor." The President asked whether there was no some way we could "get to" such groups as the Catholics, the Du, us s an re Army. Possible additional increments of military ar ere en as means of increasing U.S. leverage among military leaders. e dent also asked about "the Communists" in South Vietnam. ,jor .j was noted rather cryptically, but the impression given, rs la  e Communists were being used already, but that he questrone e ability of trying to pressure them. He apparently sa e . "ready neutralists," but that the French were not really botnering to use them. The President observed that the situation m South leu-.am "does look blacker" to the public than it apparentlyif something could not be done to change the impression eing given in the news. 152 Toward the end of the discussion ofconsul4a4OnS+V'h+erw South Vietnamese, President Johnson stated his convlctron " was too weak to take on the DRV militarily. He acknowledged that th South Vietnamese had received good training, but emphasized that we "must have done everything we can" to strengthen them before such a conflict occurred. 153 This attitude was reflected in the guidance given to Ambassador-Taylor and in the statement he was authorized to mke to the GVN. The statement contained a passage assertxng that the u.b. Government did not believe "that we should incur the risks which are inherent in any expansion of hostilities without firtt assuring a. ere is a government-.in Saigon capable of handling e serious problems involved in such an expansion and of exploiting the favorable effects which may be anticipate! The statement went on to emphasize that before the-United States could move to expand hostilities, the GVN would have to be capaole o       TOP SEQRET , t-hot its plans for furcher "maintaining law and order," of ensuring with "the enemy reactions operations would be carried out, and of coplag- t pattern of which must be expected to result" from changes in the cur operations. 154 TT q consultation with other The White House discussions of u  affinaation that we needed allies were prefaced by the President s str 'B several of these "new dramatic, effective" forms of assiscance phipptnes were speci-countries.

(of South Vietnam?) without action; (2) it may be necessary to act from a base not as strong as hoped for; (3) it is not certain, however, how public opinion can be handled; and (4) it is desirable to send out a "somewhat stronger signal." In addition, a comment not entirely legi-ble stated "Meanttres cant do as much(1) U.N. and (2) international negotiations?." In the context of the discussions, the impression left by these notations is that the White House was con- siderably less than certain that future U.S. actions against North Viet-nam would be taken, or that they would be desirable. 161 58        III P.jPIEMEHTUiG THE POLICY When Ambassador Taylor next met with the President on the afternoon of 3 December, McGeorge Bundy was the only other official present. Prior toj this occasion, Taylor had sat with the other Principals to review specific features of the Administrations position and to work out details of the scenario that was about to go into production. When he left the Presidents office, presumably having received the final version of his instructions, the Ambassador told reporters that he was going to hold "across-the-board" discussions with the GVN. Asserting that U.S. policy for South Vietnam remained the same, he stated that his aim would be to improve the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. Although he hinted of changes "in tactics and method," he quite naturally did not disclose the kind of operations in which the United States was about to engage or any future actions to which immediate activities could lead. 162 1. Early Actions Phase One actions to exert additional pressures against North Vietnam were quite limited, Only two, the GVN maritime operations and U.S. armed reconnaissance missions in Laos, were military actions. The others involved stage-managing the public release of evidence of the increased Communist infiltration into South Vietnam and the acquisition of additional assistance for that country from other governments. aGVN Maritime Operations. Maritime operations under OPLAN 34A represented nothing new. 1These had been underway steadily since 4 October, and their November schedule was in the process of being carried out at the time the decisions on inmiediate actions were being made. On 25 November, six PTF craft bombarded a barracks area on Tiger Island with 8lmm mortars, setting numerous fires. Moreover, a proposed schedule for December had been submitted by C0OJSMACV on 27 November. This included a total of 15 maritime operations involving shore bombardments, a junk capture, a kidnap mission, and a demolition sortie against a coastal highway bridge. 164 According to the concept, these were to be intensified during Phase One. Soon after the decisions had been made to begin Phase One, the JCS tasked COMUSMACV with developing a revised December 34A schedule to better reflect the newly adopted pressure concept. CINCPAC was requested to submit revised 34A plans so as to arrive in Washington not later than 8 December. The instructions specified that these were "to include pro-posed sequence and timing for increased frequency of maritime operations" in two packages. The first was to begin on 15 December, extend over a period of 30 days and provide for "shallow penetration raids.,.on all 59        types of targets which would provide the greatest psychological benelits ..." Destructive results and military utility were to be strictly secondary considerations. Package Two was to add 4 to 6 U.S. aircraft to afford protective cover and incorporate action against certain North Vietnamese coastal targets above the l9th Parallel. This package was intended to begin approximately 30 days following initiation of the first, although the instructions cautioned that the plans should be "prepared to provide for an indefinite period" of operations under Package One. 165 MACV's new proposal for maritime operations was submitted on 5 December, with proposals for psychological operations and aerial resupplyreinforce missions following close behind. On the lCth, appro-val for the latter two was communicated back to the field. At the tine, the MAROPS proposals were still under consideration within the JCS. ! On the l2th, the JCS submitted their two-package proposal. Included in their first 30-day package were coastal bombardment of radar sites, barracks, and PT boat bases plus a maritime equivalent o. aerial armed route reconnaissance. Patrol boats would make "fire sweeps , along the coast against "targets of opportunity." In addition, upon their return from bombardment missions, it was proposed that the GVN Pl' boats attempt the capture of NVN junks and SWATOW craft. With the single exception of the coastal fire sweeps, all of these initial package operations Rere approved by OSD, and instructions were issued to implement the ini cal increment of such operations on or about 15 December. 167 In accord with the instructions initially issued regarding inten-sified maritime operations, OSD decisions on the proposed second package were deferred. The JCS indicated that the addition of U.S. air cover, and the necessary command and control procedures needed to support such operations, could be implemented on or about 15 January. They went on to recommend that if this were decided, the "maritime operations should be surfaced.. .prior to implementation of Package Two.' 1 The JCS were disconcerted over disapproval of the fire sweeps along the North Vietnamese coast. -However, their concern.stemmed not so much from the lack of support for those particular operations as from their view that the disapproval removed from the package the only signi-ficant intensification beyond the level already attained before the Presidents Phase One decision. At a Principals meeting on 19 December, Acting JCS Chairman, General Harold K. Johnson, pointed out that with the modifications now made to it, the 34A program was, in effect, not inten-sified at all. Moreover, as discussion revealed, seasonal sea conditions were now so severe that no maritime operation had oeen completed sucess-fully during the previous three weeks. 169 In effect, therefore, the rtintensified" December schedule of approved maritime operations still remained to be implemented as the month drew to a close. 60       '  For January, the JCS urged that several air missions be added to the kind of operations already approved. Included were two VFAF air strikes, using unmarked aircraft and U.S. air escort for returning surface craft. 170 However, both of these items were disapproved; only the air operations in sunport of psychological and resupply operations gained acceptance. 171 Apparently there was little additional MAROPS activity during January, 1965; the normal documentary sources include very little for this period. b. Armed Reconnaissance in Laos. Like the maritime operations, armed reconnaissance in Laos was, in some respects, a continuation of operations that had been underway for some time. At least, U.S. aircraft had been operating over Laos since the previous May, performing recon-naissance functions and providing armed escort for these and (since October) the RIAF strike'missions. Of course, armed escort was carried out under strict rules of engagement that permitted attacking ground targets only in response to hostile fire. Given the operational code YANKEE TEAM, these carrier and land-based missions had been .ollowing a constant pattern for several months. Tnis had included roughly our daylight reconnaissance flights in the Plaine des JarresRoute 7 area every two weeks, and during a like period, approximately ten reconnaissance flights in the Panhandle, and two night-reconnaissance flights along Route 7- Complementing these efforts were those of the RIAF, whose T-r3 s harassed the Pathet Lao, gave tactical air support to Royal Laotian .Army units, interdicted Route 7 and the Panhandle, and performed armed route reconnaissance in Central Laos. During the period 1 0ctober-30 December, there were a total of 724 T-28 sorties in the Panhandle alone. These had already precipitated several complaints from the DRV, alleging U.S.-sponsored air attacks on North Vietnamese territory. 172 The intended U.S. policy was discussed with Premier Souvanna Phouma on 10 December by the new U.S. Ambassador to Laos, William Sullivan. He reported that Souvanna "fully supports the U.S. pressures program and is prepared to cooperate in full." The Premier particularly wanted interdiction of Routes 7, 8, and 12, but he insisted on making no public admission that U.S. aircraft had taken on new missions in Laos. The Administration had indicated to the Vientiane Embassy a few days earlier that it wished the RLAF to intensify its strike program also, particularly "in the Corridor areas and close to the DRV border.'' 173 In the meantime, the JCS developed an air strike program to complement the YANKEE TEAM operation in accordance with current guidance, and had instructed CINCPAC to be prepared to carry it out. The program included missions against targets of opportunity along particular portions of Route 8 and Routes 121 and 12. It also included secondary targets for each mission that included barracks areas and military strong points. The second mission was to be flown not earlier than three days following the first. l?4 The program was briefed at a 12 December meeting of the 61  .      Principals by Deputy Secretary Vance and was approved by them with one exception. They amended the ordnance instructions vmich had been pre-pared for CINCPAC to specifically exclude the use of napalm. For, its first use against targets in Laos, they felt, the RIAF would be the only appropriate user. McGeorge Bundy stated that the amended program "fulfilled precisely the President's wishes," and that he (Bundy) would so inform the President. He further stated that, barring separate ad-vice to the contrary, the program should be executed, it v,as also agreed at this meeting that there would be no public statements about armed reconnaissance operations in Laos unless a plane were lost. In such an event, the Principals stated, the Government should contmue o insist that we were merely escorting reconnaissance flights as reques e by the Laotian Government. 175 Armed reconnaissance operations in Laos, called r.-tEL ROLL, got underway on 14 December. This first mission was flown by SAr jet aircraft along Route 8. It was followed on the !7th by carrier-base A.-l and jet aircraft, striking along Routes 121 and 1 =. On he 1 , this pattern of two missions by four aircraft each was determlned >y Secretary of Defense or higher authority to be the weekly standard--at least through the third week. 176 Just a day earller, .e na proposed a second week's program that included repetition o. -e rrs week's operations plus missions along Route 7, 9andt23- .heirproposa s were prepared with a statement of JCS understanding that a gra ua increase in intensity of operations is intended for the second weec. Recalling Souvanna Phouma's reported requests for such operations, they also included a strong recommendation that Route 7 be stIuc as par ci the second week's missions. 177 This same rationale was voiced by General Johnson in the Prin-cipals meeting on 19 PerembAr- He pointed out that the BARREL R LL program briefed there by Deputy Secretary Vance did not represent any intensification beyond the previous weeks effort. Vance conflime. c not intensifying the program had been one of the criteria applied in selecting the second week's missions. Consensus was reached by .e Principals that the program should remain about the same for the next two weeks, in accordance with the most recent guidance. 178, At the end of December, when there was serious question about the efficacy of maintaining the direction of U.S. policy in couth Vre nam, Defense officials reouested an evaluation of the nnKREL ROLL program. In particular, they were concerned as to "why neither tne DRV nor the Communist Chinese have made any public mention of or appeared to have taken cognizance of our BARREL ROLL operations." 179 In response, a DIA assessment indicated that the Communists apparently had made no "distinction between BARRET, ROLL missions on the one hand and the Laotian T-28 strikes and YANKEE TEAM missions on the other. Attributing all stepped up operations in Laos to the United States and its laceys, they had lumped all operations together as "U.S. armed im.el.erence m 62        Laotian's sic affairs, gross violations of the General Agreements, and events which are causing a grave situation in Laos and Indochina." DIA went on to observe that "it would be most difficult to distinguish. between YANKEE TEAM with its flat suppression aircraft from the BARREL ROLL missions." Further, the assessment observed that "BARREL ROLL strikes have followed T-28 strikes by varying periods of time and have been of lesser intensity. They probably appear to be a continuation of the Laotian program." It concluded "On balance, therefore, while the Communists are apparently aware of some increased use of U.S. aircraft, they probably have not considered the BARREL ROLL strikes to date as a sig-nificant change in the pattern or as representing a new threat to their activities." 180 Despite the lack of discernible Communist reaction to BARl-iLL ROLL by the end of the year and considerable concern among the JCS, there was little change in the operation during early January. On the 4th, CINCPAC was authorized to go ahead with the fourth week s program 'One U.S. armed reconnaissancepre-briefed air strike missions in Laos for the week of 4-10 January 1965, is approved. Additional missions will be the subject of later message." (Underlining added) The approved mission called for night armed reconnaissance along Route 7, the first of its kind, 181 At the time, the JCS were awaiting a decision on their proposals for a complementary mission, but the Department of State had objected to their choice of a secondary target because it was located near Cambodian territory. Earlier in the series, the Tchepone barracks had been deleted as a secondary mission by the khite House because a Hanson Baldwin article had named it as a likely target. On 5 January, the JCS representative reminded the Principals that the currently approved BARREL ROLL mission constituted the fourth week of tnese operations and, therefore, would terminate the initial 30-day period of Phase One pres-sures. The JCS were quite concerned that there had not yet been plans made for a "transition phase" of stepped up attacks to begin around mid-January. 182 c. Surfacing Infiltration Evidence. An integral part of the Administration's pressures policy, particularly if U.S. forces were to be involved in direct attacks on North Vietnam, was the presentation to the public of convincing evidence of DRV responsibility for the precarious situation in Sorth Vietnam. As seen earlier, a former intelligence specialist, Chester Cooper, was selected to compile a public account of the infiltration of trained cadre and guerrilla fighters, to be used for this purpose. His account was to be developed from the various classi-fied reports that had been produced and was to lay particular stress on the alarming increase in the rate of infiltration in the latter half of 1964. ' 63        Cooper submitted his report on 4 December. It was based on (1) a St ate-sponsored updating of the so-called Jorden Report., wmch described also the DRV's direction, control and materiel support of the insurgency (this had been discussed during the pollcy discussrons in the Spring and initiated during the Summer; (2) the MACV infiltra-tion study, based on interrogations of VC prisomers and conn e e m October; and (3) reports from a DIACIA INR team who went to Sargon in mid-Lovember to evaluate the MACV report (they confirmed its validity). His report consisted of four items (1) a summary statement and a more detailed public discussion of VC infiltration fT.lB D; ( ) a is possible questions and suggested answers for use with the press or ne Congress; (3) "a reconciliation, or at least an explanacron oi Pas v estimates of infiltration given in Congressional testimony an o e press"; and (4) a listing of available documentary evidence and graphic materials to aid in public presentations. In his covering memoran urn, Cooper urged that the materials be forwarded to Saigon so as o ma- e MACV and Embassy officials fully aware of the proposed approach and to make consistent its use by U.S. and GVN personnel. 183 The Cooper materials were forwarded for review to the Embassy on 8 December, and to the Principals on the 9th. 1 or thereafter, Secretary Rusk cabled Ambassador Taylor, expressing is concern that early release of the infiltration data would genera ,e pressures for actions beyond what we now contemplate. he soug ( Taylor's advice as to whether release would be wise. In the . oassa or s reply, he urged early release. He stated, "I do not feel ray a ns point, the substance of the release will generate pressure or ex rene action." Moreover, he expressed the view that release wou serve to quiet the currently rife speculation among news correspon an. of the GVN concerning what the United States was intending o o in , n. Citing a New York Daily News article (7 December) as an example of what he felt were increasingly likely leaks, he expressed his iesue o ma.e planned deliberate announcements of what the United Sua es Itasnot oing and what might be done in the future. He expressed his inter ion o have the GVN release the report on infiltration, complete vi . press briefings and statements, between 10-17 December. 135 Despite strong recommendations from the field to release the infiltration data, the Principals determined that it should not yet be made public. During the first part of December, the chref a oca e .or not releasing it was Secretary McNamara. At their meeting on 1. Decern er, Mr. Vance stated that Mr. McNamara wanted to withhold the infi ra ion data for the time being. His rationale was not recorded in the minutes. The State Department opinion in response was that the Department dr no consider it of any great moment." Thereafter, the Prmcrpa s eci e that release should be withheld, at least until their next meeulng, 19 December. 136 By the time they met again, a week later, several expressions of support for releasing the data had been received. On the 1 th 64        Ambassador Taylor recalled that the ARV1. intelligence chief had reviewed the original MACV infiltration report and the proposed press release an had "concurred in commending declassification." On the loth Ambassador Sullivan praised the Cooper report and suggested passing it to Souvanna Phouma prior to what he hoped would be a prompt public release. 1-At the Principals meeting these views were cited.in a strong statemen by William Bundy concerning the problems of keeping the.infiltration evidence out of the press. General Johnson, Acting Chairman, JCS, favored release as a morale boost to U.S. personnel in South Vietnam. McGeorge Bundy and Carl Rowen (USIA) favored gradual or piecemeal release. However, Mr. Vance repeated Secretary McNamara's wish to continue sup-pression of the infiltration report possibly for an indefini e perro This view finally prevailed, asthe Principals agreed not to release uhe Cooper report either in Saigon or Washington, instead, they e .a the President might disseminate some of the information throug sue ! vehicles as his State of the Union message or in a contempla e C is mas address to U.S. forces in Saigon. 188 Following the meeting, but before receiving reports concerning the current political upheaval in Saigon, the State Departmen can e the Administrations decision not to make a formal GA US release of e infiltration data. It gave as rationale the feeling that formal release "could be misinterpreted and become vehicle undesirat e specu in, and suggested alternative procedures. Stating that general oac groun briefings...should continue to indicate infiltration has increased wi ' -out getting into specifics," it indicated that under pressure, e aigon Embassy "could have one or more deep background sessions with fthe American forces." The cable cautioned, however, that specific numjers and comparisons with previous years estimates should be avoided. ..166 would not be released, it was advised, until late in January after, sennor Administration officials had testified to Congress in a scheduled inqurry. The current aim was stated "to get general picture into survey stores such as Grose article of .November 1 rather than as spot news commanding wide attention." The cable concluded by acknowledging a just received. Taylor message and approving his stated judgment.to proceed vith periodxc background briefings in Saigon, along lines outlined above. 139 Following the rift between the South Vietnamese military leaders and the American Embassy, resistance to the release of infiltration data hardened. In cables of 24 December, Ambassador Taylor was instructed to avoid background briefings on the infiltration increases until the po-litical situation clarified. He was counseled that release o. the data would be "unwise" unless he were to obtain evidence that the South Viet-namese military was planning to go ahead with a unilateral release. 190 These instructions prevailed until well into January, !9o5 d. Consultations with "Third Countries." In the days immediately following the policy decisions of 1-3 December, several U.S. allies v. ere consulted concerning the intended U.S. approach in Southeast Asia. In 65  .      accord with the Principals' views, the governments of Thailand and Laos were briefed by the respective U.S. Ambassadors to those coun rres. Foreign Minister Thuan Khoman later visited the .resident in kashingon and presumably pursued the matter further. The Canadians were contacted in both Ottawa and Washington. William Bundy held discussions in new Zealand and Australia on 4-5 December. Prime Minister .-.ilson.o ne United Kingdom was thoroughly briefed during a series of meetings in Washington, 7-9 December. Later, William Bundy told the Principals that the U.K., Australia and New Zealand received the full picture of immeulate U.S. actions and its stipulations to the GVN and the potential ;wo-pnase concept of graduated pressures on North Vietnam. The Canadian Governmen was told slightly less. The Philippines, South Korea and the Republic oi China were briefed on Phase One only. 191 One of the aims stressed by President Johnson in the meeting of 1 and 3 December, and continually thereafter, was obtaining increase., assi. ance for the GVN and for our efforts on its behalf from our allies. Durrng e 12 December Principals meeting, for ex.am.ple, , illiam Bundy rela e President's recent wish to obtain assistance even from goverrmen s -1 .ou strong Southeast Asia commitments, like Denmark, vest Germany and In i<. This was mentioned in the context of a summary report on current third-country assistance of all kinds to South Vietnam.' 19R At the time, however, not only general assistance from many countries but specifically military assistance from a select few .as prtic j, y sought. During the consultations with allied governments, both Aus ra n. and Hew Zealand were pressed to send troop units to assist A-.n . supported the U.S. policy decisions as probably necessary, but neither was willing at the time to make a commitment, new Zealand offlcia s ex-pressed grave doubts that Phase II would lead to negotiations, pre .c mg instead that the DRV would only increase the clandestine troop deployments to the South. They expressed doubts about the advisability of sending allied ground forces into South Vietnam. 193 The concept under which the allied troop deployments were believed desirable was related to that which the NSC Working Group had recommended as deserving further study. Contemplated was an international .orce . built around one U.S. division, to be deployed just south of tne p..n in conjunction with stepped-up USGVN air operations against North Vietnam. In essence, therefore, it was a Phase Two concept, dependent in.some respects on the degree of success achieved during Phase One accivities. The concept was examined in detail by the Joint Staff in early.Decemoer, and their staff study was forwarded to the services and the Joint Paclfrc Headquarters "fcr comment and recommendations' on 10 December, the pur-poses cited for such a force deployment by the Joint Staff were stated as follows (1) to deter ground invasion by the DR1; (?) to hold a blocking position against DRV attacks down the coastal plain and make more difficult DRV efforts to bypass"; and (3) to be "capable of holding the defensive positions against attack until reinforcements arrive if required. 191 66  .      . The degree to which the international force was believed to offer a useful option seems to have been in question. While the State Department and other non-military agencies apparently favored it, the Department of Defense was less than enthusiastic. At the 19 December Principals meeting, for example, all of those present agreed that "suitable planning toward such a force should go forward" except Assistant Defense Secretary McNaughton. He stated that he thought the idea had been shelved. 195 Later, in their review of the Joint Staff's study, the services expressed reservations concerning the concept. They questioned its military utility, due to the deployments being framed essentially within a narrow deterrent context. They recommended instead a continued adherence to the deployment concept in the approved SFATO plans, which in their totality were aimed at the military defense of all Southeast Asia. The Army, in particular, expressed concern regarding routes and modes of possible DRV advance into South Vietnam that differed from those assumed by the study's belowthe-DMZ concept. The Air Force pointed out that the international force concept conflicted with the JCS concept for deterring and dealing with overt DRVCHICOM aggression as submitted on 14 hovemoer (JCS. 1-955-64) 196 Mr. McNaughtons comments on 19 December seem to have been correct. The case files containing the service comments on the international force concept indicate no further action by the JCS after mid-January. In the meantime, however, a different approach to attracting wider allied participation in the military defense of South Vietnam appeared promising. On 29 December, OSDISA reported readiness on the part of the Philippine, ROK and GRC Governments to provide various forms of assistance to South Vietnam. Included in the available Philippine and Korean packages were an assortment of military forces. The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff offered a combat engineer battalion, an engineer field maintenance team, an Army transportation company, and a Marine Corps combat engineer company. The Philippine Government stated its willingness to send a reinforced infantry battalion, an engineer construction battalion, and some Special Forces units. 197 2. Relations with the GVN Following his second meeting with President Johnson, Ambassador Taylor returned to Saigon. He arrived on 6 December amid press specula-tion concerning the details of his instructions and subsequent U.S. actions. 198 The basic charge given him by the President had been well publicized since their meeting on the lst; "to consult urgently with the government of Prime Minister Tran Van Huong at to measures to be taken to improve the situation in all its aspects." However, such a diplo-matically worded statement left much room for imaginative interpretation -- particularly in view of the Ambassador's "unannounced stopover in Hong Kong to get a briefing by U.S. 'China watchers' in that listening post." Several correspondents speculated on the likelihood of air action 67        against the North. One, with an apparent inside source, even reported that these would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of strikes in Laos and the GVN reactions to U.S. suggestions for improvement. 1S a. Joint Planning. In the days lmmediately following his return, Ambassador Taylor's schedule precipitated press reports of fran-tic activity within the Embassy and other parts,of the U.S. Mission in Saigon. Taylor first briefed his Embassy Council and the . mbassy staff on the policy discussions in Washington and the joint US; GVN courses o. action which it was hoped would be followed in South Vietnam during ensuing weeks. On 7 December, he met with Premier Huong and his senior ministers and with General Khanh. On these occasions he outlined the military and diplomatic actions which the U.S. Government intended co take during Phase One and explained how the Administration related .e possibilities of Phase Two actions to GVN perform nce. The Ambassador described in general terms the.kinds of administrative improvemen s an joint planning activities which U.S. officials thought the GVN should undertake. 199 Similar sessions were held during the next few days, as the details for the joint GVliUS efforts were worked out. On the evening of the o , Ambassador Taylor held a reception for members of the High 1 ational Council and General Westmoreland hosted the top ARVTt generals at dinner. At both occasions, Taylor briefed the assembled on U.S. attitudes vsr the GVN and, presumably, on the Administration's calculations of U.o. risk relative to GVI capability. On the following day, he held a leng y session with Premier Huong, Deputy Premier Vien and General Khanh. On this occasion, he distributed a paper outlining nine specific actions which the U.S. Government believed were needed to strengthen the GA and in which the local U.S. mission was committed to help, laylor reporce' that the "paper was generally well received" and that specific joint action responsibilities" had been agreed on. These were to be confirmed in writing on the following day. On that same day, he submitted a pro-posed GVN press release, describing in general terms the nature of the new U.S. assistance to be given and the new areas of C-VN and joint GVNUS planning, designed to improve the situation in South Vietnam. 200 On the llth, having obtained Administration approval,an o.ficial GVN statement was released to the press. It related that a series o. discussions with the U.S. Mission" had just been completed and that the U.S. Government had offered additional assistance to improve the execu-tion of the Government's programs and to restrain not offset' as originally worded the mounting infiltration of men and, equipment from North Vietnam. Among military measures, it specified that U.S. support would enable "increased numbers of South Vietnamese military, para-military and police forces" and would permit "the strengthening of the air defense of South Vietnam." It also mentioned assistance for a variety of forms of industrial, urban and rural development and premised 68  .      a GVN effort to improve "security and local government in the rural areas." The statement closed with the following two paragraphs, which subsequent events made to appear ironic but which were juxtaposed with great care "Together, the Government of Vietnam and the United States mission are making joint plans to achieve greater effectiveness against the infiltration threat. "In the course of the discussions, the United States repre-sentatives expressed full support for the duly constituted Government of Prime Minister Huong." 201 A.s the following section will show, the joint planning that had just gotten underway for reprisal actions and Phase II operations was soon to be halted. It was deferred for a period of about three weeks during the forthcoming GVN crisis. However, as implicit in the quoted paragraphs above, its resumption provided'effective U.S. leverage to help bring about an accommodation between the military dissidents and the civilian regime. b. GVN Crises. Late in the evening of 19 December, high-ranking South Vietnamese military leaders, led by General Khanh, moved to remove all power from the civilian regime of Premier Huong. The move came in the announced dissolution of the High National Council, which had been serving as a provisional legislature pending adoption of a permanent con-stitution, and the arrest of some of its members. Air Commodore Ky, acting as spokesman for the military, claimed that their intent was "to act as a mediator to resolve all differences in order to achieve national unity." The immediate apparent conflict was with the Buddhists who had been demonstrating and threatening to provoke civil disorders in protest against the Huong government. In Ambassador Taylor's view, however, the underlying motive was growing antipathy with particular members of the High National Council, brought to a head by the Councils refusal to approve a military plan to retire General (Rig) Minh from active service (and thus remove him from a position to contend with the ruling military clique). Moreover, the military had become quite imnatient with the civilian officials. 202 The general consensus among the Ambassador, General Westmoreland and State Department officials was that General Khanhs relationship with the other influential generals and younger officers was rather uncertain. Therefore, they sought to bolster Premier Huongs resolve to remain in office on the basis of an understanding with the generals -- even to the extent of seeking Khanhs resignation or dismissal. When presented with U.S. views, Khanh gave initial appearances of recognizing that the mili-tary seizure had directly defied the U.S. policy position and the stipulate! basis for continuing joint GVUUS efforts, and of accepting the need to withdraw. However, he quickly attempted to turn the crisis into a direct confrontation between himself and Ambassador Taylor. 203 On the 22nd, he issued a strong public affirmation of the military leaders' actions, . 69        of the need to avoid situations "favorable to the common enemies commu-nism and colonialism in any form," and of the military's resolve "not to carry out the policy of any foreign country." On the 24th, informa-tion was received that he intended to pressure Premier Huong into declaring Ambassador Taylor personna non grata. 204 Administration reaction to this challenge indicated that it considered Khanhs defiance as a threat to the foundations of U.S. policy in South Vietnam. Ambassador Taylor was instructed to inform Huong that the U.S. Government regarded the PEG issue as a "matter of gravest importance," and that "any acceptance of Fhanhs demand or hesitation in rejecting it would make it virtually impossible...to continue support of the GVN effort." Suggesting that Huong might asked if he thought the "American People could be brought to support continued U.S. effort in SVI in face fotj PNG action against trusted Ambassador," the Administration urged persistence in encouraging Huong to seek an accommodation with the other military leaders. Moreover, high-ranking MACV personnel were urged to exploit their close relationships with South Vietnamese counterparts to encourage such an arrangement. As leverage, Taylor was encouraged to emphasize the intended directions of U.S. policy, subsequent to a strengthened and stable GVN. Specifically, he was urged to point out that joint reprisals for unusual VC actions and "any possible future decision to initiate the second phase" were impossible as long as current conditions persisted. He was told, "without offering anything beyond tenns of your instructions you could use these to their fullest to bring Ry and the other generals around." 205 There is no indication in the available sources that this advice was directly employed. It is evident, however, that Ambassador Taylor had explained the dependency of further U.S. actions on GVN progress very clearly to tire key military leaders on 8 and 20 December. 206 Therefore, they were well aware that continued U.S. assistance along the policy line explained to them was predicated on their cooperation, and this was demonstrated early in the crisis. Even before Khanhs public declaration of independence from U.S. policy, it became known that joint talks con-cerning increased aid to the South Vietnamese war effort had been sus-pended. A few days later that fact was given additional circulation, with emphasis that this suspension included particularly any discussions of measures to reduce the infiltration from Laos and North Vietnam. 27 The degree to which the suspensions of joint planning actions affected the judgments of the South Vietnamese generals is, of course, not clear. What is apparent, ho.ever, is that this factor together with careful Embassy and Administration efforts to clarify possible misunderstandings led the generals to reconsider. 3y 28 December, Ambassador Taylor was reporting encouraging signs of an accommodation. 208 On the 29th, Secretary Rusk advised the President that the "generals were having second thoughts" and that "he hoped to see signs of political unity in Saigon soon." These comments were made in close cooperation with reports 7Q  .      that the Administration now felt that Premier Huong's cabinet might require broader representation. Finally, on the 9th, e genera s pledged to return to terms agreed to during the previous .ugus v er y matters of state would be left in the hands oi a crvi an goernmen . The joint communique issued by Huong and Khanh also promise o spe y convene a representative constituent assembly to replace ne igh sa ion Council. 209 The generals' reassessments were no doubt helped by a strong U.S. public statement, directed toward the South Vle namee press, plaining the U.S. policy position toward that country s po 1 ica. u ation. In language strikingly similar to the Presiden s ra ins ruc tions to Taylor, it included the following "The primary concern of the United States Goverrment and its representatives is that there be in Saigon a sta e government in place, able'to speak for all itscom-onen to carry out plans and to execute decisions. Jithou" suc a government, United States cooperation with and assis ance to South Vietnam cannot be effective. "...The sole object of United States activities has been and continues to be the reestablishment as quickly as possi e of conditions favorable to the more effective prosecu -on o. the war against the Vietcong." 210 Consistent with the expressed U.S. policy position, discussions between U.S. and GV. officials concerning expanded assistance to the Soutn Vietnamese war effort were resumed on 11 January, 11 However, the apparent reconciliation of South Vietnams military and civilian leadership was short-lived. Close on the heels of an announced GVN decision (1? January) to increase its milit ary draft calls long advocated by the U.S. Mission student and Buddhist rio s swept through Hue and Dalat. On the 20th, as arrangements wete comp e to appoint four leading generals to Premier Huong's cabinet, a lea rng Buddhist official issued a proclamation accusing tne Huong Govenmen o attempting to split the Buddhist movement. On the 2lst, Tri Quang issued a statement charging that the Huong Government could not exist without U.S. support, a charge that gained in intensity in the days to follow. On the 23rd, Buddhist leaders ordered a military struggle against the United States. Denouncing Premier Huong as a lackey 01 the U.S. Amoassa-dor, they accused Taylor of seeking to wipe out Buddhism in Vietnam. In Hue, student-leu demonstrators sacked the USIA library and destroyed an estimated 8,000 books. Two days later, riots and strikes were in progress in Hue, Saigon and Da Nang, and Hue was placed under martial law. Mean-while, military leaders were attempting to convince Buddhist spokesmen to call off their demonstrations against the CT. and the united States. Finally, on the 27th, the generals withdrew their support from tne Huong        Government, and General Khanh issued a statement that he was resuming power "to resolve the political situation." Soon after, the Buddhist leaders issued orders to their followers to halt their demonstrations, at least until they had sufficient opportunity to observe the perfor-mance of the new regime. 212 Thus, in late January, the United States Government was faced with a dilemma. In December, it had spoken out quite clearly to the effect that its continued assistance along previously determined policy lines was dependent upon the effective functioning of a duly constituted South Vietnamese Government. By its actions and statements during the initial December crisis, it had indicated that what it had in mind was a civilian regime governing without interference from any particular group. Mow, less than a month from the settlement of the former crisis along lines compatible with the preferred U.S. solution, it was faced with another military coup. A time for reassessing former policy decisions and taking stock of the shifting debits and assets in the U.S. position had arrived. c. Joint Reprisals. Meanwhile, an issue of great significance to the Administration) as well as to future relations with the GVN, was adding to the growing dissatisfaction with progress achieved in other Phase One actions. One of the basic elements in Phase One policy was to have been Joint GVl;US reprisal actions in response to any "unusual actions" by the VC. when faced with a significant provocation at the end of December, the Administration failed to authorize such actions. At the time, the circumstances in South Vietnam provided cogent reasons for not doing so, but it nevertheless represented a significant depar cure from the agreed policy position. .At the height of the first government crisis, on Christmas nve, the Brink U.S. officers billet in downtown Saigon was bombed and severely damaged. Two Americans were killed and 58 injured; 13 Vietnamese also were injured. 213 No suspicious person was observed near the building, so the reponsible party was unknown. In reporting the incident, Am-bassador Taylor treated it as an occasion for reprisal action. The immediate Administration assessment was that under current political circumstances, neither the American public nor international opinion might believe that the VC had done it. Moreover, with clear evidence lacking, it felt that a reprisal at this time might appear as though "we are trying to shoot our way out of an internal political crisis." Given the political disunity in Saigon, the Administration believed "it would be hard for the American people to understand action to extend the war." Therefore, so the reasoning went, it would be undesirable to undertake reprisals at that time. However, in cabling this assessment, Secretary Rusk added "but we are prepared to make quick decision if you Taylor make recommendation with different assessment of above factors or with other factors not covered above." 214 72        Recommendations to take reprisal action came from several quar ters. Citing what it called "a further indication of Viet Cong respon-sibility, and cautioning against adding the Brink affair to t e len noa instance of unreciprocated enemy provocation, Cn CPaC urge a reprrsa attack. He argued that the "bombing of Brink BOQ was an act amed directly at U.S. armed forces in RVn" and that fallure o respon wo only encourage further attacks. 215 Ambassador .aylol orwar e ..na he termed "a unanimous recommendation1, by himself and mem erso- ne . o. Mission Council "that a reprisal bombing attack oe execute' fas soon as. possible" on a specified target "accompanied by statement relating tms action to Brink bombing." He stated that "no one in this par o e world has Ahe' slightest doubt of VC guilt" and pointed our that the NT, was publicly taking credit for the incident. 210' Citing raylor s request and concurring in his recommendation, even to the specific arge selection, the JCS added their voices to those arguing for reprxsals. m their proposed execute message to CINCPAC, they proposed one-day mission by 40 strike aircraft against the Vit Thu Lu Army oarrac s. Further, they recommended that the VNAF should participate if their state of readiness and time permitted. 217 In spite of these strong recommendations, the decision was made not to retaliate for the Brink bombing incident. On 29 December, the . following message was dispatched to the U.S. embassies in Southeast ,.sia and to CINCPAC "Highest levels today reached negative decision on proposal ...for reprisal action for BOQ, bombing. We will be sending fuller statement of reasoning and considerations affecting future actions after.Secretarys return from Texas tonight." 218 Available materials do not include any further explanation. 3- Policy Views in January As the new year began, the Administration was beset with frus-tration over an apparent lack of impact from Phase One operations, over its failure to take reprisals after an attack on U.S. personnel, and over the still troublesome crisis within the GVn. In this mood, U.S policy was subjected to various kinds of criticism and comment. Some, came from within the Administration, various reactions came from outside ita. Public Debate. At the height of the GVN crisis, a number of newspapers and periodicals joined with the already committed (in opposition) and influential Mew York Times and St. Louis Tost Dispatch in questioning U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia andor advocacing U.S. withdrawal from the entanglements of South Vietnam. 219 In the midst of this kind of public questioning, a major debate arose among members of Congress and enmeshed, on occasion, leading officials in the Adminis-tration. Leading off in opposition (26 December) was Senator Church,        who criticized U.S. involvement in South Vietnam and W0' policy in support of the neutralization of all Southeast Asia Senator Dirksen voiced agreement (2 January) with the nee r a .gan ment, preferably involving both the .Administra'ion ve up in Congressional leadership, but he stated his own vi  Vietnam means a loss of face throughout the Onen . The debate blossomed in January. In a T m television day, Sunday, 3 January, Secretary Rus e Ruling out policy in the context of a year-end foreign policy reP pusv gave either a U.S. withdrawal or a major expansion o e ' . e assurances that with internal unity, and our ai Cn ariOther South Vietnamese could themselves defeat the iRsurg c u Vietnam network three Senators expressedour in-and urged a pub11c reevaluation of it.

Senator Long and Congressman Ford indicated on a TV program that they didn't feel that such operations were a par-ticularly dangerous course" for the nation to follow and that t. ey were the kind of actions that could help protect our forces in South Vietnam. Senator Morse criticized the bombings as part of the Administration s "foreign policy of concealment in Southeast A.sia. On the l9t > in e Senate, he repeated his blasts, charging that the air strikes ignore . the 1962 Geneva A.ccords and violated the nation's belief in su s 'i u ing the rule of law for the jungle law of military might. Broadening his attack he warned that "there is no hope of avoiding a massrye war n Asia" if the U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia were to continue without change. 224 b. Policy Assessments. The intensifying public debate and the events and forces which precipitated it brought abou an equa y se -ing reassessment of policy within the Administration, e .ere is little evidence in the available materials that shows any seriou ques tioning of former policy decisions among the Principals, ques loning 1 occur within the agencies which they represented. It is c ear la s of the judgments and alternative approaches were discusse u le,e members, and presumbably, some found their way into discussions 1.1 . t ,e President. One very significant and probably influential viewpoint was registered by the Saigcn Embassy. In a message (TAB E) described as the reflections of Alexis Johnson and Ambassador Taylor on which General Westmoreland concurred, the thrust of the advice seemed to be to move into Phase Two, almost in spite of the political outcome in Saigon. After listing four possible "solutions' to the then-unsec bled GVN crisis, Taylor identified either a military takeover coupled with Huongs resignation or a successor civilian government.dominated by the military as equally the worst possible outcomes. (It is important co note here that, depending on how one interprets the structure of the January 27th regime, one or the other of these was in fact the case at the beginning of the air strikes in February, 195) In the event of such an outcome, Taylor argued that the United States could either "carry on about as we are now" or "seek to disengage from the present intimacy of relationship with the GVN" while continuing to accentresponsibility for its air and maritime defense.. .against the D-V. In the case of disengagement, he argued, the United States could offset tne danger of South Vietnamese leaders being panicked into making a deal with the NLF "if we were engaged in reprisal attacks or had initiated Phase II operations against DRV." The message then summerizedjthe three different conditions under which the Mission officials thoughtPhase Two operations could be undertaken "A. In association with the GW after the latter has proved itself as a reasonably stable government able to control its armed forces. , 75  .      B. Under a situation such as now as an emergency stimulant hopefully to create unity at home and restore failing morale. C. As a unilateral U.S. action to compensate for a reduced in-country U.S. presence."

The reasons why this kind of impact was believed likely was related to a perceived lack of realism or effectiveness in U.S. policies during the late autumn. Bundy reflected an apparently widely shared concern that Administration actions and statements since the election had convinced the Vietnamese and other Asians that the U.S. Government did not intend to take stronger action and was "possibly looking for a way out." Moreover, he saw this impression being created by our "insisting on a more perfect government than can reasonably be expected, before we con-sider any additional action and that we might even pull out our support unless such a government emerges.'' 227 To change this impression and reverse the disturbing trends, Bundy and others in State suggested stronger actions, even though recog-nizing that these actions incurred certain risks. However the immediate actions suggested fell somewhat short of Phase Two (a term that was not used in the correspondence). They included (1) an early occasion for reprisal action..."; (2) "possibly beginning low-level reconnaissance of the DRV...1'; (3) 'an orderly withdrawal of our dependents, which was termed "a grave mistake in the absence of stronger action"; and (4) "introduction of limited U.S. ground forces into the northern area of South Vietnam..,concurrently with the first air attacks into the DRV. They downgraded the potential of further intensifying the air operations in Laos, indicating that such actions "would not meet the problem of Saigon morale" and might precipitate a "Communist intervention on a substantial scale in Laos" The perceived risks of the suggested actions were (1) a deepened U.S. commitment at a time when South Vietnamese will appeared weak; (2) the likelihood of provoking open opposition to U.S. policies in nations like India and Japan; (3) the uncertainty of any meaningful stiffening effort on the GVL; and (4) the inability of "limited actions against the southern DRV" to sharply reduce infiltration or "to induce Hanoi to call it off." 228 If the graduated, "progressively mounting,'1 air operations of Phase II were implied by these suggestions, it appears that they were perceived as being entered rather gingerly and with little intent to intensify them to whatever extent might be required to force a decision in Hanoi. Rather, the expectancies in State were quite different "on balance we believe that such action would have some faint hope of really improving the Vietnamese situation, and, above all, would put us in a much stronger position to hold the next line of defense, namely Thailand." Moreover, Bundy and others felt that even with the stronger actions, the negotiating process that they believed was bound to come about could not be expected to bring about a really secure and independent South Vietnam. Still, despite this shortcoming, they reasomel that their suggested "stronger actions" would have the desirable effect in Southeast Asia "...we would still have appeared to Asians to have done a lot more about it." 229 77  .

In his view the latter was the more important of the two. Sharing the State view that South Vietnam was being lost ( thls means that a government not unfriendly to the DEV will probably emerge wi. m two years"), he believed that the U.S. reputation would suffer least "if we continue to support South Vietnam and if khanh and company con-tinue to behave like children as the game is lost. However, .e pom e out that "dogged perseverance" was also recommended because the situation might possibly improve. 233 In specific terms, McNaughton defined perseverance as including the following course of action "a. Continue to take risks on behalf of SVN. A reprxsal should be carried out soon. (Dependents could be remove a that time.) b. Keep slugging away. Keep help blowing, ni l do not increase the number of US men in SVN. (Addition-diers are as likely to be counter-productive as productlve.) c. Do not lead or appear to lead in any negotiations..

In the event of inability to prevent deterioration within South Vietnam, he urged the development of plans to move to a fall-bc.c posx ion y helping shore-up Thailand and Malaysia. 234 An OSD assessment made immediately after the Khanh coup in late January adds perspective to this viewpoint. In it, hc..augh'on s ute and Secretary McNamara agreed, "U.S. objective in South Vietnam is nc to help friend' but to contain China." In particular, o t e.a aysl and Thailand were seen as the next targets of Chinese aggressiveness. Neither official saw any alternative to "keep plugging lnso ar as ..efforts inside South Vietnam were concerned. However, outside she borders, both favored initiating strikes against north zietnam. At fst, they believed, these should take the form of reprisals; beyond that, the Administration would have to "feel its way" into stronger, graduated pressures.
