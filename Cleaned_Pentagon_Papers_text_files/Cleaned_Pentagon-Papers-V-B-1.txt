STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Acting upon your Instructions, I called on the French Ambassador this morning and gaVe him the oral reply Which you haVe formulated to the Ambassadors aide-memoire of August 6th, on the subject of the demanda made bythe Japanese Government upon the French Government with regard to authorization to.send troops across Indochina, to use the local air fields in Indo-ch.ina, to station forces at the air fields for the purpose of assuring their security, and to send planes, munitions, and all necessary material through Indochina destined to the Japanese Army. I told thc French Ambassador that we have been doing and are doing everything possible within the framework of our established policies to keep the situation in the Far East stabilized; that we haVe been progressive- ly taking various steps, the effect of which has been to exert economic pressure on Japan; that our Fleet is now based on Hawaii, and that the course Which we have been following, as indicated above, gives a clear indication of our intentions and activities for the future. I also raised with the French Ambassador the question whether it would be practicable for the French to delay discussions with the Japanese with renpect to Indochina for a period. I furthermore told the Ambassador that the British Ambassador had been informed of this matter by you in a most strictly confidential manner and that if the British had any observations or comments to make we would transmit them immediately to the French AmbassadorCount de Saint-Quentin stated that he felt that this reply to the French request support in her negotiations with for assistance and Japan would very Taken from HSS-for Foreign Relations of the United States, 1940; not yet cleared for publication    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL probably not be considered by his Government as sufficient prospect for support to enable them to withstand the pressing demands made by the Japanese Government for the establishment of certain rights in Indochina in addition to the economic demandsaccompanying the former. He said that ho did not think it Would be practicable for the French Government to delay the negotiations because the Japanese had themselves stated at the time of making the demands that if the French GoVernment did not acquiesce in the granting of these rights, the Japanese Government had every intention of taking the necessary action to acquire them. He went on to say that in his opinion the phrase "within the framework of our established policies1, when associated with the apparent reluctance of the American GoVernment to consider the use of military force in the Far East at this particular time, to mean that the United States would not use military or naval force In support of any position which might be taken to resist ths Japanesc attempted aggression on Indochina. The Ambassador asked me to conVey to you thus his construction of your oral reply conVoyed to him through me this morning and his fear that the French GoVernment would, under the indicated pressure of the Japanese Government, be forced to accedo to the demands set forth In his aide-memoire.

As reported, these demands include, right on part of Japan to move armed forces of Japan through that French possession, the right of armed forces of Japan to use air bases at certain points there, etc. The statements given by the Secretary cf State to the press on April 17 and Jiay 11, 1940, set forth this GoVernments belief that (1) intervention in the domestic affairs of the Netherlands East Indies, or (2) any alteration, by other than peaceful processes, in their status quo would be prejudicial to the cause of security, SvaKllityT'and peace in the entire Pacific area, not Just in the region in question. Also, there was set forth the obserVation of the GoVernment of the United States that the belief restated in the preceding sentence was based on a doctrine of universal application and that it is a doctrine unequivocally Supported by this Government. The same belief and the same obserVation naturally apply to French Indochina likewise. This GoVernment is seriously perturbed, therefore, oyer the demarche which it is reported that the GoVernment of Japan" has 'made to the French authorities. If no objection is perceived, it is my desire that st your early convenience you call upon Minister for Foreign Affairs and that you express to him, as under instruction frcn your GoVernment and along the lines aboVe indicated, the concern felt by the Government of thc United States regarding the reported deyelopments. k.T VELEES As printed in Foreign Relations of til?

W.420 'i-rand>.tin by Air. Cecil lf. Gray, Assistant to the Secretary of State Washington, July 24, 1941. In a telephone conversation with Acting Secretary Welles at 1230 <. tn. on July 23, there was considerable discussion about the Far E.lstem situation. Thc Secretary spoke of tho latest venture of .1 -.imu toward acquiring bases in Indochina in the face of the fact that .Lipan waS not threatened by any nation on the globe. This south-v.ard movement, he said, stemmed from a policy of force and con- Ho referred to the friendship of Darlan51 and Hitler and of the elements in the French Government who were iu favor of turning all France over to Hitler. The Secretary said that, of course, our own Government would do its utmost to carry out any understanding that might be arrived at with Japan, and that Japan was not in danger in tho South Sea area. Hcnco that Country must be bent on conquest, in which case . me future Japanese Government would take tho final steps toward domination of that entire region. There followed an exchange of views as to what Ur. Welles should .ay to the Japanese Ambassador later in the afternoon when he kept appointment with Mr. Welles.52 Thc Secretary's general idea was that if ths Japanese Ambassador .Rtniptcd to explain away the Indochina move by saying that it had L'en brought about by peaceful means, then such peaceful means"ere completely contrary to the spirit of the discussions between the V Cited States and Japanese Governments looking toward a friendly Adm.

The United States Government, Mr. Hull said, Could only ba driven to the conclusion that our discussions for a friendly settlement had been wiped out by the Indochina development. Tho Secretary said that if we waited until he Camo home to tell Ambassador Nomura the foregoing, then it would come too late as a warning to Japan. We must let them sec the scriousnesS of the step they have taken and let them know that such constitutes an unfriendly act because it helps Hitler to conquer Britain. The Secretary said that if we did not tell the Ambassador all this, he would not sit down with Admiral Nomura when he came back to Washington. It would be a farce to do so. There followed quite a bit of discussion about Counter measures on the part of thc United States, with Ur. WellcS explaining what the British proposed to do, what our Army and Navy boards favored, what the President favored, et cetera, and, as I understood it, the Secretary left thc decision on these questions to tho judgment of those on tlic ground.  Seeretary Hull then camo back to the subject of Hr. Welles forthComing talk with Admiral Nomura, nnd he said that Sir, Welles might begin the conversation by speaking to Admiral Nomura ConCerning a readjustment of tho United States position vis-A-vis Japan somewhat aS follows There is a profound belief everywhere, in view of many reports from many sources, that the Japanese movement into Indochina has two probable purposes, or at least two possibilities this Government cannot ignore (1) if this Government is to be safe, it is bound to assume that this act constitutes definite notice of the launching of a policy of force and conquest on the part of the Japanese Government; (2) this Government, in the interest of its own safety and in the light of all Japaneae utterances and acts, muSt assume that by its actions and preparations Japan may be taking one more vital and next to the finaI step in occupying all the South Sea area. Such a statement to the Ambassador would lay the basis for our own future acts and would let the Japanese understand fully our position. It was agreed between the Secretary and Mr. Welles that there was no use to pursue our discussions for a friendly settlement with the Japanese unless the Japanese policies are to coincide with their professions. Wo could get any kind of an agreement from the Briti-I and other governments looking to the safeguarding of Japanese legitimate interests so that there is no red basis for Japanese chim? of being threatened or in danger. It was agreed between the Secretary and Mr. Welles that something must bo said to the press along the lines of the foregoing par.i      EFFORTS F0R AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN . graphs. This would be for tho purpose of making a record about the real significance of the Japanese movement and likewise to acquaint the public with the fact that we knew what was going on. Ur. Welles then read to the Secretary ft draft of a statement prepared by tha Far Eastern Division. The Secretary made specify Comment as foIIows make clear thc fact that the occupation of Indochina by Japan possibly means one further important step to seizing control of the South Sea area, including trade routes of supreme importance to thc United States controlling such products as rubber, tin and other commodities. This was of vital Concern to the United States. The Secretary said that if we did not bring out this point our people will not understand thc significance of this movement into Indochina. Thc Secretary mentioned another point to be stressed there is no theory on which Indochina could be flooded with firmed forces, aircraft, ct cetera, lor the defense of Japan. The only alternative is that this venture into Indochina has a closc relation to the South Sea area and its value for offense against that area. The Secretary closed by suggesting that Mr. Welles make dear to Admiral Nomura that we are ready and desirous of going forward with our discussions should circumstances permit, and that if an agreement were readied between our two Countries, it would safeguard Japan far more securely than taking over Indochina. He said for Mr. Welles to ask the Ambassador to send this to his Government. C. w. Gray 740.0011 P.

Excerpts From Secbetabt Hulls Remarks in Telephone Conver- satiox lYnu Acting Secketaky Welles on JULY 25, 1941 We have had conversations for several months -with the Ambassador nnd his assodates Covering this matter completely and we couldnt have offered more assurance to Japan for her entire satisfaction from every standpoint than we did in those discussions.

NND 63.316,  FOREIGN' RELATIONS, 1941, VOLUME IV bassador when I didnt see him here to go over the whole situation. Then we sent Hamilton again to sea his two associates for the purpose of keeping alive tlw whole situation that we had under discussion. Then finally, before they got to a face-saving stage, after it was apparent that they were preparing the Indochina move, this was followed up by a final step of summing up for the record the pros and cons nnd making a final appeal to the Japs before it was too late. That is the record wo made. I think it ought all to be kept in mind. It is a fact that, in justice to the Administration, tho Government and the State Department, ns the Chinese-Japanese difficulties dcveIopad, we not only expressed opposition and condemnation at appropriate times, but we gradually took steps of retaliation. I need not mention all the steps. When the question of oil became most seriously Considered for the first time, there was not a long period between that point and the point when Japan and tho Netherlands proceeded with their trade negotiations, which involved oil nnd raised the whole oil question. Now, in those circuinStances, not with the idea of appeasing Japan ourselves, but merely to deal practically with an international situation that had become ncutc, so far as oil was concerned, in connection with those negotiations, and which was clearly to remaln acute until those negotiations were concluded, we rested our position before those negotiations had ended. The Japanc,-. Government through its Ambassador Came to us with a proposal for a peaceful settlement covering the entire Pacific area, including tl.c question of oil and everything else, and I have had, as you know, seventeen conferences with him. There is a strong so-called peace group in Japan back of him (the Ambassador). Naturally, it wouM have been utterly impractical for US to have followed a purely appeaso-ment policy when every consideration would prevent us from putting on embargoes and penalties nnd retaliation during theso negotiations. My judgment is that the State Department and the Government should not say too much on this Japan ess question. The first thing we know we will run into a storni. It is so delicate and there are so many anglea to it. I am sure Japan is going on unless something happens to stop her. This is a world movement. Thc Japanese are seeking . to dominate militarily practically one-half the world and apply th' barbarous methods that they are applying to China and that Hitler is applying in Europe, and if they have their way, they will carry out what they are Saying o their right to be supreme in that half o tho world, by which they mean military supremacy with methods of arbitrary, selfish domination and the Hitler mCthod of piracy an.l naval Control of tha seas and commerce. At any rate, I just want you to keep that in mind. Cfrci. W. Gra"j I . Sectton 3.3    711.942177  MEIORANDUH BY THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE1  WASHINGTON,? July 24, 1941I . At the rcquest of the Japanese Ambassador, the President received, the Ambassador for an off-the-recoid conference in the Oval Boom at tl.e White House at five oclock this afternoon. At the Presidents request. Admiral Stark and I were present. The President then went on to say that this new move by Japan ., .in Indochina created, an exceedingly serious problem for the United States. He said that, as I had stated to the Ambassador yesterday,insofar as assuring itsclf that it could obtain foodstuffs and raw materials from Indochina, Japan, of course, had it reacted an agree-ment with the United States along the terms of the discussions be-tween Secretary Hull and the Ambassador, would have been afforded far greater assurances of obtaining such supplies than any other nation, More than that, the President said., the cost of any military occupation is tremendous end the occupation itself is not conductive to the  production by civilians in occupied countries of food supplies and raw materials of the character required by Japan, Had Japan undertaken to . obtain the supplies she required from Indochina in a peaceful way, she not only would have obtained larger quantities of such supplies, but would have obtained then with co-mlete security and without the draining expense of a military occupation. Furthermore, from the , military standpoint, the President said, surely the Japanese Gcvern- nent could not have in reality the slightest belief -chat China, Great Britain, the Netherlands or the United States had any territorial designs on Indochina nor were in the slightest degree providing any real threats of aggression against Japan. This Government, consequently,' could only assume that the occupation of Indochina wes being undertaken . by Japan for thc purpose of further offense and this created a situation which necessarily must give the United States the most serious disquite. The President said that he had been following in complete detail the conversations which had been progressing between Secretary'' Hull and the Ambassador and that he was confident that the Ambassador would agree that the policies not undertaken in Indochina by the Japanese Government were co-ibletely opposed to the principles and the letter of the proposed agreement which .had been under discussion.

U, pp. 527-530. -------------  8 .     711.942177 Cont. 1 At this point the Ambassador took out of his pocket two sheets of notes which he had prepared and asked the President's permission to refer to them in order to make a statement of his Governments position. In this exposition the Ambassador covered exactly the same ground which he had covered in his conversation with me last night. The only points of difference were that at the outset of the conversation, the Ambassador very clearly and emphatically stated that the wove by Japan into Indochina was something thich he personally deplored and with which he personally was not in agreement. The President then said that he had a proposal to make to thc Ambassador which had occurred to him just before the Ambassador had come in and which he had not had. time to talk over with me bcfore making his proposal to the Ambassador, The Presidcnt said that it might be too late for him to make this proposal but he felt that no matter how late the hour might be, he still wished to seise every possible opportunity of preventing the creation of a situation between Japan and the United States which could only give rise to serious misunderstandings between the two peoples, . The President stated th?t if the Japancse Government would refrain from occupying Indochina with its military and naval forces, or, had such steps actually been commenced, if the Japanese Government vtould withdraw such forces, the President could assure the Japanese Government that he would do everything trithin his powcr to obtain from the Governments of China, Great Britain, the Mctherlands, and of course the United States itself a binding and solemn declaration, provided Japan would underbake thc same commitment, to regard Indochina as a neutralized country in the same way in which Switzerland had up to now been rcgarded by the powers as a neutralized country. He stated that this would imply that none of the powers concerned would undertake any military act of aggression against Indochina and would remain in control of the territory and would not be confronted with attempts to dislodge them on the part of de Gaullist or Free French agcnts or forces.     711.942177 Cont.l ( If these steps were taken, tho President said, Japan would be I given solemn and binding proof tint no other power had any hostile > designs upon Indochina, end that Japan would be afforded the fullest freest opportunity of assuring herself of the source cf food supplie and other raw materials in Indochina which she was seeking to secure. The Ambassador then reiterated concisely and ouite clearly what the President had suggcstv.de He then made some statement which was not quite clear to the effect th?t such ? stcp would be very difficult at this time on account of the face-saving element involved on thc part of Japan and that only a very groat statesman would reverse a policy at this time.

Sumner Welles, issued the following statement on August 2 in reply to inquiries from the press concerning thc agreement entered into between the French and Japanese Governments regarding French Indochina "The French Government at Vichy h=s given repeated assurances to the Govcmmcnt of the United States thrt it would not cooperate with the Axis powers beyond the obligations imposed on it by the armistice, and that it would defend the territory under its control against any aggressive action on thc part of third powcrs. "This Government has now received information of the terms of thc agreement betwecn the French and Japanese Governments covering the so-called common defense of French Indochina. In effect, this agreement virtually turns over to Japan an important part of the French Empire, "Effort has been made to justify this agreement on the ground that Japanese assistance is needed because of some menace to the territorial integrity of French Indochina by other powers. The Government of the United States is unable to accept this explanation. As I stated on July 24, there is no question of any threat to Frcnch Indochina, unless it lies in the expansionist aims of the Japanese Government, "The turning over of bases for military operations and of territorial rights under pretext of common dcfcnse1 to a power whose territorial aspirations are apparent, here presents a situation which has a direct bearing upon the vital problem of American security. For reasons which aro beyond the scope of any known agreement, France has now decided to permit foreign troops to enter an integral part of its Empire, to occupy bases therein, and to prepare operations within French territory which may bc directed against other peoples friendly to the people of France. ,' "The.

" The French Government at Vichy has repeatedly declared its determination to resist all encroachments upon the sovereignty of its territories. However, the German and Italian forces availed themselves of certain facilities in Syria to carry on operations directed against the British, the French Government, although this was a plain encroachment on territory under French control, did not resist. But when the British undertook defense operations in the territory of Syria, the French Government did resist. "Under these circumstances, this Government is impelled to question whether the French Government at Vichy in fact proposes to maintain its declared, policy to pre's'erve for the French people the territories both at home and abroad which have long been under French sovereignty. "This Government, mindful of its traditional friendship for France, has deeply sympathized with the desire of the French people to maintain thcir territories and to preserve them intact. In its relations with the French -Government at Vichy end with thc local French authorities in French territories, the Unitcd States will be governed by the manifest effectiveness with which those authorities endeavor to protect these territories from domination and control by those powers which are seeking to extend their rule by force and conquest, or by the threat thereof" 12      711.942504 DOCUMENT HANDED BY THE SECRET.'RY OF STTE TO THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR (KOMuRA) ON NOVEMBER 26, 19411 StIictly Confidential, Tentative and Without Commitmento ' WASHINGTON, November 26, 1941, Outline of Proposed Basis For Agrccmcnt Between The United States And Japan SECTION II STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY THE GOVERN,rnl.T OF THE UNITED STITES AND BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN.

More than a year ago Your Majestys Government concluded an agreement with the Vichy Government by which five or six thousand Japancse troops were permitted to enter into Northern French IndoChina for the protection of Japanese troops which were operating against China further north. And this Spring and Summer the Vichy Government permitted further Japanese military forces to enter into Soutbcrn French Indo-China for the comon defense of French IndoChina. I think I am correct in saying that no attack has been made ' upon Indo-China, nor that any has been contemplated. During the past few weeks it has become clear to the world that Japanese military, naval and air forces have been sent to Southern Indo-China in such large numbers as to create a reasonable doubt on the part of other nations that this continuing concertration in . Indo-China is not defensive in its character. Because these continuing concentrations in Indo-China have ' reached such large proportions and because they extend now to the southeast and the southwest corners of that Peninsula, it is only reasonable that the people of the Philippines, of the hundreds of Islands of the East Indies, of Malaya and of Thailand itself are asking themselves whether these forces of Japan are preparing or intending to make attack in one or more of these many directions. I am sure that Your Majesty will understand that the fear of all these peoples is a legitimate fear in as much as it involves their peace and their national existence. I am sure that Your Majesty will understand why the people of the United States in such large numbers look askance at the establishment of military, naval and air bases manned and equipped so greatly as to constitute, armed forces capable of measures of offense. As printed in Foreign Relations of the United States Japany 1931-1941, vol. II. pp. 7841786.  14.     It is clear that a continuance of such a situation is unthinkable. None of the peoples whom I have spoken cf above can sit either indefinitely or permanently on a keg of dynamite, There is absoluteely no thought on the part cf the United States of invading Indo-China if every Japanese soldier or sailor were to be withdrawn therefrom.  I I think that ve can obtain the sane assurance from the Governments of the East Indies, the Governments of Malaya .and the Government of Thailand. I would even undertake to ask for the same assurance on the part of the Government of China, Thus a withdrawal of the Japanese forces from Indo-China would result in the assurance of peace throughout the whole of the South Pacific area.

Delegation of the French Committee of National Liberation, to the Department of State  Translation . Washingiox, October 20, 1943. Memorandum According to certain information which has come to the knowledge of tho Committee of National Liberation, AIlied plans of operation in the Far East would, in the near future, include the start of operations against the frontiers of Indo-China, operations entrusted to Chinese troops. The Washington Delegation of the Committee has already had OCCasion to Call the Department of StatC's attention to the absolute importance to thc Allied cause of associating the Competent French authorities with the detailing of Allied war plans in the Tar East, especially when their execution involves French Indo-China. The aforementioned authorities possess, in this field, documentation and experience which Can be of thc greatest use to the Allied High Com-inand. Tho role which France has traditionally played in the Far East, the important interests which she has there, thc dispositions already taken by the Algiers Committee to participate when the time comes in the struggle for the liberation of Indo-China, are all, as many more, reasons for an effective French participation in Inter-Allied Councils where the general strategy of the United Nations in the Far East is determined. As concerns the project of a Chinese offensive against Indo-China, the Algiers Committeeif the information which has reached it on thia subject is Correctmust very seriously draw the attention of the American Government to thc great danger which its realization would present.

Handed cu Octolcr 21 to the Assistant Secretary of State (Berle) by Hsmi Hoppenct, Delegate of tte Freneh Committee of National LiberatiOn,  1.3526.  .   t 1 proposed CAMPAIGN IN INDOCHINA zi Chinese attack against Tonkin would have tho immediate effect of causing the whole Indo-Chinese population tc rise against the Allies. For the Annamites, tha Chinese, who have so frequently in the past invaded and ravaged their frontier regions, represent the hereditary enemy. Far from greeting them as liberators, thc local population would impede their advance by every means in their power. Moreover, the population and tha French troops, who would take the side of tho Allies if it were French, American and British forces which were coming to their help, might very well react against an attack by the Chinese, whose true intentions could easily ba Confused by enemy propaganda. Thc position which a Chineso attack apparently will cause Civilian and military French Indo-Chinese to take will in the future be difficult to modify and ths consequences of such a mistnkc run the risk of weighing heavily upon tho development of the campaign. The French Committee of National Liberation believes, therefore, that it is of the highest importance to set aside a projcct which, far from serving Allied interests, runs the risk of causing the greatest harm, lite Committee, likewise, equally belicvcS that, as concerns military operations whose theatre would be French territory, it is imperative to ask the Allies that no decision should ba taken without cur previous agreement. 740.0011Pacific War333i Memorandum of Conversation, Jy thc Assistant Secretary of State Berle ' , I WASHINGTON, October 21, 1943. M. Hoppenot came in to see me at his request. Ho handed mo the attfiChcd memorandum,3 which states that the French National Com- f mitteo understands that Chinese operations will presently open against the Japanese within the frontiers of Indochina. This gave great con-cem to the Committee of National Liberation. If Cbinesc troops attaCked there, plainly there would not bo any support from the   FrenCh, since the Chinese had always claimed interest there, and it > was not unlikely that the French troops would defend against n Chinese attack. I asked whether this matter had already been brought to tho atten-tion of the Chiefs of Staff. M. Hoppenot said it had, through General Supra.  1 18 .     FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1043, CHINA Bethouart.

This brlngS us squarely up to tho problem of whether, in the Far East, wo arc reestablishing the western colonial empires or whether we are letting the East liberate itself if it can do so. I feel that the matter should be discussed on a high level with thc President for his decision. I do not know that we need to settle matters with the French Committec in Algiers. If the Chinese can do anything against the Japanese in French Indochina to the general advantage of thc war, I have difficulty in seeing why we should stop them. Afnorr A.

Mr. SiBITINius In connection with the application of the French Committee of National Liberation for membership on the Pacific War Council, it is of interest that the reprcScntative of the Committee yesterday presented US with a request that we do not permit the Chinese to take part in operations against the Japanese troops which aro presently occupying Indo-China. Thc Committee observed that if British and American troops accomplished the reconquest this would be quito all right; but the French, and partkularly those in Indo-China, Considered the Chinese as their hereditary enemies (crbfeir.de); if they took part in the liberation of Indo-China, probably they would claim new territory. The French would push this view in tho Pacific War Council. This would probably be supported by the British and the Dutch. This would present us, for all practical purposes, with the task of rccon-quering Indo-China almost single-handed (since tho British intereSt stops with Burma) for the sole purpose of returning Indo-China to France. France is unlikely to be able to maintain herself in control of, or protect, that province for a good while; so that ve should have tho added 'ob of policing and protecting it against the Chinese as well 8S the Japanese in the interest of the French Colonial Empire. It strikes me that this fact should be called to the attention of the President and also of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? I think we Should On October 20 Mr. Stettinius replied to Ur.

Bfrle We hare read with keen interest your memorandum of conversation with Mr. Hoppenot and his aide-memoire, and concur in the opinion expressed in your note. There is at thc bottom of page 1 of the aide-memoire the following statement which wo feel should not pass without comment Pour lAnnainite, les Chinois, qui out si frequemment dans lc passe envahi et ravage leurs regions irontieres, representent Icnnenn hereditaire," This statement is grossly misleading, if not actually false. In 1S79 the Annamites sought military aid from China to drive out thc French. It was Chinas weakness, not Annamito dislike or fear of China, that permitted the French to remain. Recurrent waves of Annainite nationalism have looked to Chinese nationalism for inspiration and guidance, particularly since 1920. Today tliere is understood to be in southern China a group of Annamites which advooates independence for Indochina and seeks Chinese support. It is our belief that thc Annamites, by and large, have for the Chinese a feeling of friendliness and cultural affinity. The ChineSC Governments attitude regarding the post-war status of Indochina has been cautious. OUcials of the Government have disclaimed territorial ambitions but they hare at times intimated that China would desire an arrangement which assured access to the sea from Yunnan Province through Tonkin to Haiphong. Independenco for Indochina is included in the Chinese Governments general advocaCy of self-government for eastern peoples. request that tte Chinese be asked not to conduct tallltai- operations within Indo-China should be referred bOth to the President and to the Joint ChlctS of Staff. iDltiated by the Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs (Ballantine). 20 .     FOHEIGN RELATIONS, 1911, CHINA The post-war status of French Indochina is a matter of speculation return to France; international control; and even British control. It is our belief that the Annamites are fundamentally capable of selfgovernment nnd that it should be thc objective of any post-war ad-ministvation to train Annamites to resume thc responsibilities of selfgovernment. This objective might be achieved by a continuation of Frendl administration for a definitely limited pariod or by international administration. Thore would seem to be no reasonable basis for British administration. In any event, the Chinese Government should be consulted and its views given full consideration in regard to plans for the future of Indochina.

Dear Mr. Berle I have already had occasion to speak to you of tho interest which ths French Committee of National Libaration would attach to being associated in the inter-Allied deliberations concerning the conduct of tho war in the Far East, particularly when it is a matter of operations which may involve Indochina. I refer particularly to the aide-memoire which I transmitted to you on this subject October 21, and which contemplated on the one hand the entrance of a representative of the Committee into the PttciftC Council, and on the other hand the apprehensions caused at Algiers by a proposed Chincso offensive against the frontier of Indochina. M. Massigli has just requested me to recall this question again to your high attention. The cooperation of thc French staff with the Allied staffs in thc Far East has as n matter of faCt entered into a new phase folIowing the sending to Delhi, with the accord of the British War Office, of a French military mission commanded by General Blaizot. This new fact seems to make it more desirable that a parallel collaboration should bs established at Washington, hy the association of a French representative in the deliberations of the PacifiC Council of which delegates of all thc Powers participating in the war effort against Japan are members, . We have learned, morcovCr, that the proposed Chinese operations on thc frontier of Indochina bare not been abandoned and that irregular Chinese troops, staffed by American officers, are said to be trained at the present time for this purpose near tho said frontier. The Chi-nesc elements in question aro precisely thc ones whose incursions and piHaging have frequently created, in the course of recent decades, n state of insecurity and trouble in that region, and their reappearance on Ind,ochinesJ territory, even with the Corrective of n. staff of American officers, would aggravate further the repercussions of any Chinese fiction on those frontiers. Knowing personally the mentality both of the French of Indochina and of the native populations of the Union, 22 . Section .3.3    F0REIGN RELATIONS, 1043, CHINA I am convinced that nothing Could more seriously hinder their cooperation with the Allies than for tho Jiboration of Indochina to appear to be entrusted, even provisionally, to Chinese formations which, in tho present Caso, would appear to them not only as the advance guard of the hereditary enemy of Annam and Tonkin, but aS tho direct desccndanlS of thc bands of pirates and Jolly Rogers who have so long caused the threat of their exactions to weigh upon those regions. Just ns American or English troops would be welcomed as allies and liberators, so we run the risk of seeing French and natives react strongly against the use of these Chinese elements. I do not believe that a more scrious political nnd psychological fault could be committed and I take the liberty to beg you to call this point again to the very serious attention of tho competent authorities.8 PIeusc accept etC.

He said that the recent eents in the Lebanon made public service the first step toward the independence of people who had formerly been colonial subjects. He said that in the war against Japan, in his opinion, that in addition to military missions, it was necessary to fight the Japanese in the political sphere as well, particularly in view of the fact that the Japanese had granted the least nominal independence to certain colonial areas. He repeated that France should not get back Indo-China and that the French must pay for their criminal collaboration with Germany.

According to Lord Halifax information you had expressed the opinion that Indo-China should be taken away from the French and administered by an international trusteeship." ITc wondered whether this represented your final conclusions rftnd attached importance to the matter in view of the fact that reports of your alleged conversations would undoubtedly get badt to the French.

I 1. On June 10, 1941, thc Prime Minister assured the House of Commons that TVe have no territorial designs in Syria or anywhere else in French territory"; and Subsequently, on November 10,1912, ho said31 For ourselves we have no wish but to see France free and strong, with her empire gathered round her and with Alsace-Lorraine restored. We covet no French territory. We have no acquisitive de- signs or ambitions in North Africa or any other part of the world. These commitments, lowever, are not interpreted by the British Government as including any guarantee of particular frontiers or of tho integrity of the French Empire.

We have not been able to guarantee such frontiers in respect of any nation now acting with us, but, of course, we shall do our best. 2. Like the United States, the BritiSh Government has made a number of commitments relative to the maintenance of French sovereignty in North Africa, and on March 17, 1943, tho Lord PrivySeal stated in thc House of Lords 30 that North Africa is French territory"; and Tho relationship of thc British and United States Commanders is not that of an occupying power toward the local authority of an occupied region". Memorandum by President Pooscvclt to thc Secretary of State57WashIXCTOX, January 24, 1914. I saw Halifax last week and told him quite frankly that it was perfectly true that I had, for over a year, expressed the opinion that Indo-China should not go back to France but that it should be ad-mintStered by an international trusteeship. France has had the countrythirty million inhabitants for nearly one hundred years, and the people are worse off than they were at the beginning. As a matter of interest, I am wholeheartedly supported in this view by GcncralisSimo Chiang Kai-shek3S and by Marshal Stalin.39 I seo no reason to play in with the BritiSh Foreign Office in this matter. Tho only reason they seem to oppose it is that they fear the effect it would have on their own possessions and those of the Dutch. They have never liked the idea of trusteeship bepause it is, in some instances, aimed at future independence. This is true in tho Case of Indo-China. Eaeh case must, of course, stand on its own feet, but the case of IndoChina is perfectly clear. France haS milked it for one hundred years. The people of Indo-China are entitled to something better than that. Franklix D.

Tho CiVil Affairs Division of tho War Department has indicated its dosha to proceed at once with civil affairs planning for IndoChina and beforo doing so has requested political guidance from the State Department. A number of important dedsions depend upon whether French troops are to be used in the military operations to regain control of Indo-China, and whether French nationals arc to be used in civil administration and. planning. There is ample evidence that the French hope to be consulted and to play a part in driving the Japanese from that area. SubjeCt to your approval, tho State Department will proceed on the assumption that French armed forces will be employed to at leaSt some extent in the military operations, and that in the administration of Indo-China it will bo dcsirabIc to employ French nationals who have an intimate knowledge of the country and its problems. We would assume further that the use of French forces or civilians would be without prejudice to the question of the ultimate status of Freneh Indo-China and would bo related solely to problems directly connected with and flowing from possible military operations.Edward R.

Although SEAC was advised Specifically that only military, and not political, questions might be discussed with the French Mission, political questions are in fact under discussion, Tho British SOE 49 which is actively engaged in undercover operations in Indochina has recently received orders from the Foreign Office that they should have nothing to clo with any Annamite or other native organizations in Indochina, but are to devote their efforts to the French. The 01VI50 representative at New Delhi lias received indication that the British wish OWI activities directed at the native populations in. Thailand and Indocliina be eliminated so as not to stir up native re-siatanCe to the Japanese and so incite the Japanese to send more troops into those areas. Colombo states that it is apparent SOE desires severely to restrict OSS41 operations in the SEAC theatre and to give SOE preeminence or, failing that, to establish combined SOE-OSS operation?British propaganda agencies are emphasizing thc recent appeal by the French War Ministry for recruits to participate in the campaign for liberation of Indochina on the ground that news of any French military efforts to recover Indochina would encourage the French in Indochina. OWI has so far refrained from mentioning the French appeal or other phases of French preparations for military participation fearing the adverse effect on the native populations in Indochina and elsewhere in the Far East on the restoration of the status quo ante which such preparations would appear to imply. OWI has specifically requested State Department guidance on United States policy in this regard, and have been advised to be silent on the subject despite the anticipated British broadcasts.General Donovan has submitted to the Secretary of State a report from the OSS representative in SEAC reading in part "There Can be little doubt that thc British and Dutch have arrived at an agreement with regard to the future of Southeast Asia, and now it would appear that the French are being brought into the picture. ?2 It would appear that tho strategy of the British, Dutch and French is to win back and control Southeast Asia, making the fullest use possible of American resources, but foreclosing the Americans front any voice in policy matters.

In August last His Majestys Government invited the concur-reuce of the United States Government in the following proposals (1) The estabIishment of a Frendl military mission with the South East Asia Command. This would facilitate the work of the Secret Operationa Executive and of the Olhce of Strategic ServiceS and would serve as the nucleus of the operational headquartet S which may be required later. The function of the mission would be primarily , to deal with matters concerning French Indo China and it would not participate in questions of general strategy. It would, therefore, be much on the same basis as tho Dutch and Chinese missions attached to tll& South East Asia Command.  (2) The establishment in India of a "Corps Leger d'Interrention Composed at the start of 500 men and designed to operate exclusively in Indo China on Japanese lines of communication. The activities of "Supreme Allied Commander, Southeast Asia Command. ' 41      '  FOREIGN RELATIONS, 1844, VOLUME HI this body would correSpond to those of the American and British Secret Operational organizations and its establishment Could be without prejudice to the wider question of from what sources French forces participating in the Far East should be equipped.  (3) French participation in the planning of political warfare in tho Far East. Thia would be a matter for arrangement between the South East Asia-Command and the French Military Mission. 2. Thc United States Chiefs of Staff, from a military point of view conourrcd with these proposals except that they believe that French participation in the planning of political warfare should be restricted to thc area of the South East Asia Command. No further action Could be taken by them in this matter as it was understood that the President had expressed the desire first to discuss the question of French Indo China orally with the Prime Minister. 3. Tho United States Chiefs of Staff took OCcaSion to point out that in their view, French Indo China was part, not of South East Asia Command, but of the China Theatre and was an American sphere of Strategic responsibility. They recognised that an oral uu-dorstanding had been come to between Admiral Mountbatten and the Generalissimo by which both Commanders would be free to attack Thailand and French Indo China, and boundaries between the two Theatres wouId be decided at an appropriate time in the light of progress made by the two forces. 4. This agreement was recognised by the Generalissimo after Sextant57 as applying to preoperational activities. It has however never been formally confirmed by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. 5. No further steps could be taken in obtaining the necessary approval by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to the proposals outlined in paragraph 1 of this aide-memoire until thc President and the Prime Minister had had an opportunity to discuss them. It was antiCipared that this discussion would take place at the Quebec ConferenCe. but in fact the subject never raised. Consequently no further progress has been made in this matter which is becoming increasingly urgent. 6. Admiral Mountbatten is Strongly of the opinion that useful and important work on irregular lines Could immediately be done in French Indo China. The French Anny and Civil Service are unquestionably anxious to take part in the liberation of the country from thc Japanese and CODStitute virtually a well-organised and ready-made Maquis.

Admiral Mountbatten has pointed out that French Indo China constitutes an area of vital importance to the operation of his Command since it lies on the Japanese land and air reinforcement route to u Burma and Malaya. Irregular activities therefore on the lines cn-visaged in the proposals which are the subject of this aide-memoire ar e for him a matter of urgency. ... -1 8, His Majestys Government, therefore, earnestly hope that tho United StateS Government will Concur as to the desirability and urgency of pushing on with tho irregular operations outlined aboVO and will take such action as will make possible the isstiC of a directive by the Combined Chiefs of Staff (a) confirming tho oral understanding already existing between the Generalissimo and Admiral Mountbatten, and (5) approving the program set out in the opening paragraph of this aide-memoire. Such action would in no way prejudice I tho question of the ultimate settlement of thc boundary between tha I China Theatre and the South East Asia Command, which, by the agreement between Admiral Mountbatten and the Generalissimo, is at preSent left open, nor the wider question of the participation of , regular French armed forces in the Far Eastern War.

Two or three other articles in Moscow papers at the same tine followed a similar argument and warned the British, Americans and Dutch that Indo-China would be J t used by the Japanese as a springboard for futher  expansion.

He adds, however, that the natiVes arc now becoming aware that Japanese exploitation has been shown to be the worst of all. ' about a year and a. half ago the Free French representation in Moscow, on its weekly radio broadcast from Moscow was permitted to report a press release from Algiers concerning the future of France in Indo-China. it This broadcast stated categorically that Indo-China would be reintegrated into the French Empire and that the French Committee of National Liberation realizing' the earlier mistakes of French colonial policy was working on plans for the rejuvenation and liberalisation .of the native economy and future political education .

So far as I am personally concerned, I have let the diplomatic representatives of tho so-called imperialistic governments with interests in southeast Asia ; know that I am personally opposed to imperialism but that ; I am not making the policy of the United States on that subject. I have remarked to them that tho United States is committed to tho proposition that governments should derive, their just powers from the consent of tho governed. I haVe said that I personally adhere to the principles of the Atlantic Charter which provides that we shall "respect tho right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will h llve I have commented that French imperialism and French  monopolies in Indochina seem,to me to be in conflict with those principles.

In connection with my opinion on this subject I refer also to the speeches made early in the war by Prims Minis tert.

These principles are also set out definitely the Atlantic Chartert in '61     By NWD Dale 2011 we aro I PJIItrcb what aims understand to be among insofar as that country L1 Enclosure As stated 800 -1 AIR MAIL One aspect of the maneuvers in China of the imperialistic powers which has struck me since tho beginning of my sojourn here is the assistance rendered to them (especially to tho British) by American lend lease. Tho British intelligenco and other agencies in China are supplied by air in lend lease planes. General A. Carton do Wiart, Personal Representative of Mr. Churchill and head of most of the widespread British intelligence system in China, has a personal American lend 'lease plane. It has been my observation that British agents here aro opposedsome of them frankly so--to our policy of working for a strong, united and democratic China. China is not, of course, the only part of the world in which American lend lease has becn used, is being used and will bo used for the purpose of defeating the principles for which we profess to be fighting this war. I do not blame the British or other lend lease beneficiary governments for employing lend lease i or other aid to attain their ends. I feel that it is at least in part our fault that they aro able so to do. From my observations in China I am of the opinion that responsibility for this situation rests in considerable measure upon ourselVes for failure to implement concretely the policy to which committed. The apparent continuing lack of affirmative American policy on the question of the future status of Indochina will eventually result in a vitiation of the fundamentals of our war is concerned. , .. ,, Respectfully yours, ikuPatrick J.

' o t.v 1 Confidential r  .. 1 i ( ost r 1  1 rJ v r "  , NOTE ' ' The political position taken, by the ProVisional.< , GoVernment of the French Republic regarding Indochina is plain. A few sentences will be sufficient to make it clear. -. First, France cannot admit any discussion about thc nrinciple of hor establishment in Indochina. Her presence U founded on agreements consistent with international lav and established, on the immense task carried out by her for tho sake of the Indochinese population has ncVer been disputed by any Povter. The occupation of Indochina by the Japanese has not changed anything in that state of things. This occupation is nothing but a war incident similar to tho invasion by the Japanese forces of Malaya, of tho Netherlands East Indies and Burma. The actiVity of tho underground moVement, the formation of tho expeditionary forces that we are ready to send to the Far East, aro a clear proof of the energy with which France intends to take part in the liberation of those of her territories that have been momentarily torn away from her by the enemy.  . This being clear, the French GoVornment are prepared to consider with its allies all the measures that may be taken to insure security and peace for the future in the Pacific area; it expects that its participation, in those measures will be the one it is entitled to get owing to the importance of French interests in the Far East. Furthermore, the French GoVernment has already fixed  ot the BrazzaVille conference the principles of the policy it means to-follotv in its oyerseas possessions. Accordingly it will set up together vith thc populations concerned the statue of indochina on a basis that will secure for tho Union a satisfactory autonomy within tho frame of the French Empire. Besides, Indochina will be granted an economic regime that will enable her to profit vzldely by the adVantages of international competition. Such decisions, having no international character, come within the competence of the French GoVernment only. Thoroughly aware of the importance of the principles at stake in the present war, Franco will not shrink from her responsibilities. 63      For the time being, however, Francas concern in the Fer East is mainly military. As early as Juno l943 ' the French Committee cf National Liberation made it known to its allies that it considered that zone as one where it . would be extremely desirable for all the interested parties . to set up a thorough military collaboration. On the 4th  of October 1943, it decided to fom an Expeditionary Force 1 that would take part in western Pacific operations and in ' the liberation of Indochina, In the meanwhile the French GoVernment has established in Indochina itself a network of  connections with tho French and Indochinese underground. By this action, the efficacity of which has been proted by the French Forces of the Intcrlor in France, it will i support the assault of the forces attacking from without and helu them in their task in a way that can be decisive.  ;  ' Thc French G-oVernment has informed Washington and   London of all the measures it has taken in that respect.  It asked several time's that the Expeditionary Forces should be sent on the spot and used to the best; but the answer was that thc decision belonged to President Roosevelt and the Combined Chiefs of Staff. This agreement has not yet been giVen. Yet, the French GoVernment is prepared to haVe its expeditionary forcos used on tho American as well as on the British theatre of operations. Considering there- , fore the part France is entitled to ask and ready to take in the military operations in tha Pacific, it would be adVisable that she should be admitted to the Pacific War ' Council and particularly to the Sub-Corimittoe responsible for the operations involving French Indochina..

The British may likewise be expected to encourage this view. It seems to me that without prejudicing in any way our- position regarding the future of Indo-China we can combat this trend by making public our desire to render such assistance as may be warranted by the circumstances and by the plans to which we are already committed in the Pacific area, To this end I attach a draft of a suested statement for publication, subject to your approVol, by the State Department. s S.

The action of -the Japanese Government in tearing iway the veil with which it for so lor attempted to cloak its domination of Indo-China is a direct consequence of the ever-mountino pressure which our arms are applying to the Japanese Empire. It is a link in the chain of events which began so disastrously in the summer of lbhl rd th the Franco-Japanese agreement fortho common defense of Indo-China. It is clear that this latest step in the Jepancse program will in the long run provc to be of no avail. The Provisional Government of the Freneh Republic has requested armed assistance for those who are resisting the Japanese forces in lndo-Chins. In accordance with its constant desire to aid all those who aro willing to take up arms against our common enemies, this GoVernment will do all it can to be of assistance in the present situation, consistent with plans to .Itch it is already committed and with the operations now taking place in the Pacific. It goes without saying that ell this countrys available resources are being deVoted to the defeat of our enemies nnd they will continue to be employed in the manner best calculated to hasten their downfall. 67 Declassified ter Executive Order 13526    . 851G.OO5-171I5 SEC n L T . -- THE'WHITE HOUSE .
