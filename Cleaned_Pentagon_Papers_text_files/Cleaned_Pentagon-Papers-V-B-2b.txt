JUSTIFICATION OF THE WAR INTERNAL COMMITMENTS The Truman Administration, 19451952 Contents and Chronological List of Documents 1945 Page 1. Extract of minutes of State-war-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) held 13 April Mr. Lovett states that "the lack of a policy on Indochina is a source of serious embarrassment to the military." The Committee agreed that the State Department should take up the question of clarification of policy on Indochina. Memorandum, R. E. Cox, SWNCC, to Mr. BonbrightMinutes, 23 May (13 April) 1945... 1 2. Secretary of State Stettinius informs Ambassador Caffery (France) on the status of U.S. assistance to French resistance groups in Indochina. Stettinius 1576 to Caffery (Paris), 19 April 1945 3 3. The U.S. rejects a French proposal to conclude an agreement with the French Provisional Government analogous to the Franco-Allied agreement of 25 August 1944. The U.S. refuses to consider diversion of resources to specific military operations in Indochina. Stettinius letter to French Ambassador Bonnet, 20 April 1945... 5 4. The State Department undertakes an internal task to clarify U.S. policy toward Indochina following President Roosevelt's death, 12 April 1945, and the SWNCC meeting, 13 April 1945. A summary of how the State Department documented this task and the pertinent documents follow as 4.a. through 4.e 9 a. Division of European Affairs (EUR) submits a proposed "Memorandum on Indochina Policy" to the Assistant Secretary for forwarding to the President. The memorandum . recommends that the U.S. .not oppose restoration of Indochina to France. H. Freeman Matthews, EUR, Memorandum .to Mr. Dunn, Assistant Secretary of State, 20 April 1945 9 i  .      Page b. Division of Far Eastern Affairs (FE) forwards comments and suggested changes to EUR version of the Memorandum on Indochina policy. FE recommends additions to the EUR proposals as well as not opposing restoration of Indochina to France, provided France gave adequate assurances on five major points chiefly concerning Indochinese independence. Memorandum by Mr. Stanton, FE, to Mr. Dunn, 21 April 1945.. 9 c. Mr. Dunn feels that it is better to let the Indochina policy matter drift rather than base it on the FE version of the Memorandum. Dunn message to Mr. Grew, Under Secretary of State, 23 April 1945 18 d. The final compromise Memorandum to the President includes extracts from both the FE and EUR versions, but does include mention that the U.S. would seek the French views on the five points raised by FE. Memorandum to the President, subject American Policy with Respect to Indochina, undated, not sent 19 . e. The draft cable, which was approved by all Divisions concerned, requests French indication of in- tentions on five points . 22 (1) Indochinese self-government within a French Union. (2) Economic and commercial non-discrimination. (3) Haiphong as a free port. (4) Recognition of an Indochina-Thai border. (5) International security arrangements for Southeast Asia. Unnumbered cable, 9 May 1945. 5. Assistant Secretary of war proposes "so far as practicable" the U.S. should avoid "unnecessary or long term" commitments of assistance to French resistance forces in Indochina. Memorandum, R.E. Cox, SWNCC, to Mr. Bon-bright, WE, 2 May 1945.. 26 6. French Foreign Minister is informed by Stettinius at San Francisco that "the record is entirely innocent..of this government questioning...French sovereignty over Indochina." Grew 1949 to Caffery, 9 May 1945. 27 ii        Page 7. Matthews reports to President Truman of French desires to participate in Far East war and the JCS view that little military value would accrue from the French forces. Memorandum by Matthews for Truman, 16 May 1945.. 27 8. Grew reviews for Hurley the present position of U.S. policy on "trusteeship structure" and the necessity of "voluntary" action by colonial powers and that the extent of French participation in the war in the Pacific was to be determined by Gen MacArthur. Grew 873 to Hurley (China) 7 June 1945. 30 9. The U.S. military reply to the French offer of partici-pation(by two French divisions)in the Pacific war outlines the provisions to acceptance in principle. Essentially, the U.S. desires complete command and control of the French trained, equipped and maintained divisions with movement from France based on the units having attained U.S. combat standards. Memorandum by U.S. Chiefs of Staff to Combined Chiefs of Staff at Potsdam, 16 July 1945.. 33 10. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff views that logistics considerations prevented French and Dutch participation in the Pacific war are presented to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for consideration. Memorandum by the U.S. Chiefs of Staff at Potsdam, 18 July 1945 36 11. The British Chiefs of Staff suggest that the French divisions be "employed in due course in French IndoChina." Memorandum by British Chiefs of Staff at Potsdam, 18 July 1945 37 12. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff consider the British view and compromise earlier U.S. positions to allow for possible use of French divisions under British command in areas to "be determined later." Memorandum by U.S. Chiefs of Staff at Potsdam, 19 July 1945... 37 13. Report to the President and Prime Minister of the agreed summary of conclusions on the strategic concept and policies for prosecution of the war, reached by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the terminal conference of the Postdam meeting. Basically, the Chiefs strategy focused on Japan with the U.S. controlling operations. The door was left open for French and Dutch participation based on "military considerations" and "shipping" requirements. JCS files, CCS 9003, 24 July 1945. 39  .      Page 14. President Truman informs Hurley (China) that it was agreed at Potsdam to divide Indochina at latitude 16 north for operational purposes the south going to Southeast Asia Command (SEAC) and the north going to the China theater. Hurley is urged to get Chiang Kai-shek's concurrence. Truman telegram to Hurley from Berlin, 1 Avgust 1945.. 44 15. william J. Donovan, Director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), reports on the French attitude toward the Indochina Provisional Government to the Secretary of State. A French committee was to negotiate with Annamite leaders on terms favorable to Indochina; the French were to act as advisors to the Indochina Provisional Government with the power to sign treaties for France. Annamite leaders, however, expressed the desire to have status as an American protectorate, excluding both French and Chinese occupation. Threats of violence over a French reoccupation were made. Memorandum by Donovan for Secretary of State, 22 August 1945.. 45 16. Dean Acheson, Acting Secretary of State, reasserts U.S. policy toward French control of Indochina to the Charge in China (Robertson). The U.S. neither opposed nor assisted re-establishment of French control in Indochina, Robertson was told. The U.S. "willingness" to see French control is based on the future outcome of French claims of popular support. Acheson 1622 to Robertson, 5 October 1945.. 49 17. Caffery (Paris) informs Secretary of State of the Franco-British agreement on Indochina which recognizes the French Civil Administration as sole author-ity in Indochina south of the 16th parallel. Caffery 6006 to Secretary of State, 12 October 1945 49 18. Caffery reports that de Gaulle rejected announcing a far-reaching, progressive policy designed to give Indochinese greater authority, representation, and responsibility in government under the pretext of the state of disorder which prevailed in Indochina. De Gaulle felt that "no such policy could be imple-mented pending restoration of French authority."  Caffery 6857 to Secretary of State, 28 November 1945... 50 1946 19.Matthews requests direction from Acheson on transfer of Lend-Lease vehicles from the British to the French in Indochina. Acheson replies that President Truman thought the U.S. should agree to the transfer. Acheson-Matthews notes, 18 January 1946 52iv        Page 20. Secretary of State Byrnes requests information on conditions in Indochina and especially on the status of French-Viet Minh negotiations. Byrnes 53 to Bangkok, 28 January 1946.. 53 21. Gen Gallagher, OSS, reveals that, in his view of Indochina, "one or two modern French divisions could defeat the Annamese" and that after de Gaulles October pronouncement of colonial policy, the Annamese (Ho Chi Minh) refused to negotiate with the French and became hostile. "Ho himself will not deal with the French...and will be behind any continuing Annamese movement." The Viet Minh administration was young and inexperienced but "the demand for independence is widespread and even in the villages the peasants refer to the example of the Philippines...however, the Viet Minh should not be labeled full-fledged doctrinaire communist." Memorandum of Conversation by R.L. Sharp, SEA Affairs, 30 January 1946.. 53 22. Landon reports that dArgenlieu-Ho Chi Minh negotiations have been proceeding and may be completed in two or three weeks, and that only temporary and local Franco-Chinese agreements have been realized. Landon (Saigon) 0927 to Byrnes, 5 February 1946... 58 23. Caffery informs Byrnes that the present French government "will try to follow a conciliatory and moderate policy in Indochina and will be more progressive in its outlook than de Gaulle." Caffery 595 to Byrnes, 6 February 19116... 59 24. Landon states that "It seems certain that Annamese plan desperate resistance to French. Ho Chi Minh stated that he considering petitioning all United Nations to mediate Annamese independence and prevent extensive bloodshed." Landon (Hanoi) 2 to Byrnes, 16 February 1946 59 25. Landon refers to two letters to President Truman from Ho Chi Minh which request the USA as UN member to support Annamese independence according to the example of the Philijpines. Landon summarizes the points in Ho Chi Minh's petition to the United Nations which includes a review of French conquests, Hos governmental accomplishments, and requests for intervention, by the Big Four. Landon (Hanoi) to Secretary of State, undated (received 27 February 1945)... 61 -Sensitive       Page 26. 27. The Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister, Dr. Wang, indicates that Chinese troops would be withdrawn from Indochina by 15 April and that he had urged a "bloodless" Franco-Viet Minh agreement with them, wang suggests joint Chinese-American mediation of French-Indochinese problem and refers to the late President Roosevelt's interest in dependent peoples. Smyth (Chungking) 394 to Byrnes, 28 February 1916. Reed reports signing of the 6 March agreement whereby "Vietnam becomes a free state within the Indochina federation and will have own army, direct own internal affairs, and finance... Annamites are frankly pleased...French military occupation proceeding smoothly." Reed (Saigon) 20 to Secretary of State, 7 March 1946.. 62 63 28. Saigon informs State that Chinese are putting  obstacles in the French path and Viet Minh incidents around Saigon are increasing. Reed 33 to State, 14 March 1946 ... 63 29. Viet Minh extremists assassinate a member of the Cochin China Council, French seize Hanoi Treasury, and Tonkin incidents jeopardize peaceful outcome of events. Reed 70 to State, 1 April 1946... 64 30. The U.S. informs France that the Combined Chiefs of Staff do not object to relief of Chinese troops by French forces in Indochina, and that on the repatriation of Japanese, the French military commander should coordinate with Gen MacArthur (since the Chinese and British were totally relieved of occupation and repatriation duties in Indochina). Byrnes note to Bonnet, 12 April 1946 ... 64 31. O'Sullivan (Hanoi) indicates that most important immediate question in the negotiations opening at Dalat appears to be status of Cochin China. OSullivan 2 to Byrnes, 18 April 1946 65 32. The U.S. indicates that Ho Chi Minh has requested U.S., U.K. and other recognitions as a free state within French Union. Byrnes to Consular Officers, 18 April 1946... 66  .      Page 33. Ho Chi Minh calls for Cochin-China to join Vietnam, French to cease entering Cochin-China, and for French to live up to agreements. French are pessimistic over Dalat conferences, "...over-all picture is not a . happy one..." Reed 122 to Byrnes, 27 April 1946 . 66 34. U.S. reviews the situation at Dalat conference from the viewpoint of French and Vietnamese as pessimistic (in light of recent conflicts, outbreaks of fighting,  and conflicting views on Cochin-China status) and feels that French will possibly attempt a coup when Chinese withdraw. Acheson to Consular Officers, 1 May 1946... 67 35. Acheson reports that the French are confident of success in negotiations with Vietnam, but they feel the Vietnam delegation is controlled by better- organized communists, even though only half the delegation is communist. Acheson to Consular . Officers, 13 May 1946.. 67 36. Ho Chi Minh is reported as believing satisfactory agreement can be reached with the French. Acheson to Consular Officers, 14 May 1946... 68 37. U.S. expresses concern over continued presence of Chinese troops in Tonkin and that everything possible should be done to speed evacuation. Acheson to Gen George C. Marshall (Nanking), 15 May 1946 . 68 38. French propose federal organization for Vietnam (under High Commissioner who exercises French Union powers) with a legislative assembly of ten members each from Tonkin, Annam, CochinChina, Laos, Cambodia, and ten French members. Byrnes to Nanking, 20 May 1946.. 69 39. U.S. raises Consulate Saigon to Consulate General, effective 20 May 1946. Byrnes 2427 to Caffery, 20 May 1946.. 69 40. U.S. notes three important political parties in Vietnam Viet Minh (whose most active members are former Indochinese Communist Party members), Dong Minh Hoi (DMH) and Vietnam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD), which seem to have support of the Chinese. Catholics appear to support no single party, but "as a group will not remain long absent from politics." O'Sullivan 20 to Byrnes for General Marshall, 20 May 1946. 69 .  vii  .    By NWD Dale 2011  Page 41. Ho Chi Minh has constantly given impression that "he would pay great attention to any suggestions" made by the U.S. OSullivan (Hanoi) to Byrnes, 5 June 1946. 71 42. U.S. Consul in Hanoi views Vietnam strength in Cochin-China as "diminishing," that Ho went to Paris for this reason, and at the same time, to seek support from French Left wing. O'Sullivan to Byrnes, 5 June 1946 . 71 43. Caffery reports Franco-Vietnam conference at Fontainebleau is off to a bad start, as Vietnamese delegation protested assumption of the chairmanship by head of the French delegation, protested creation of Cochin-China as an independent state, and accused French of violating 6 March agreement. Ho Chi Minh held conversations with Algerians on similarity of their problems. Caffery 3323 to Byrnes, 7 July 1946... 73 44. Vietnam breaks off negotiations at Fontainebleau on the grounds that France violated March 6 accord by convoking a new Dalat conference. Caffrey 3801 to Byrnes, 2 August 1946 . 74 45- U.S. views recent moves by the French as designed to regain a large measure of control over Indochina in "violation of the spirit . of the 6 March convention" and that widespread hostilities may result from Vietnamese resistance to these encroachments. Memorandum by Moffat (SEA) for Vincent (FEA), 9 August 1946  75 46. U.S. views results of Dalat conference as a reasonable basis for the future, but far short of larger degree of independence desired by , Vietnam, and it is difficult "to foresee any great degree success...so long as Cochin-China stays apart from Vietnam..." Reed 342 to Brynes, 17 August 1946. 78 47. U.S. expresses concern over "French colonial tendency picture U.S. as aggressive and imperialistic" and indicates closeness of this unwitting French colonial view to Communist Party line. Clayton (Acting SecState) 240 to Saigon, 78 4 September 1946...         Pa-ge 48. U.S. looks at intelligence reports linking USSR to Ho Chi Minh and requests information on relative strength and outside contacts of Vietnam communists. Clayton 241 to Saigon, 9 September 1946. 79 49. Caffery reports on visit of Ho Chi Minh just prior to signing modus vivendi; Ho declares he is not a communist. Caffery 6131 to Byrnes, 11 September 1946 79 50. U.S. is informed by French of increased communist activities in French Indochina, chiefly Chinese Communist entrenchment in Saigon and Haiphong. Agencies outside of Indochina are supplying propaganda. Reed 374 to Byrnes, 17 September 1946. 80 51. Caffery reports signing of modus vivendi and that Ho Chi Minh obtained satisfaction on many points, but French would have liked to include definition of Vietnam relations to Indochinese federation and French Union. Caffery 4671 to Byrnes, 17 September 1946. 80 52. Saigon views "amicable" meeting of Ho Citi Minh and High Commissioner in light of belief that "French Communists desire soft-pedal communist trends in Vietnam for political reasons" prior to elections. Reed 411 to Byrnes, 19 October 1946 82 53. Ho Chi Minh informs the U.S. that effectiveness of modus vivendi depends on France, fighting would not stop unless French applied the agreement, and that Cochin-China "must be united to Vietnam." O'Sullivan 96 to Byrnes, 25 October 1946. 82 54. Contact between Vietnam and Chinese Communists is apparent, but the presence of Chicoms as advisors in the provinces is difficult to verify. Reports of Chicoms in Haiphong are regarded with suspicion. OSullivan 101 to Byrnes, 1 November 1946.. 83 55. Caffery reports French concern over "positive proof" of direct contact between Moscow and Ho Chi Minh. Caffery 5857 to Byrnes, 29 November 1946... 83 56. U.S. Consul views Ho Chi Minhs contacts with France as designed to facilitate application of Marxist principles when, and if, a Communist government is established in France. Further, French concern ix   .         Page of Ho's communist contacts at this time is peculiar when they are forcing collaboration or preparing a puppet government; this ploy is a possible diversion from French policy in Indochina. O'Sullivan 131 to Byrnes, 3 December 1946  84 57. Acheson instructs Moffat on Ho Chi Minh's communist record and offers guidelines of U.S. policy in discussion with Ho. Essentially, the U.S. is concerned over Tonkin events, the American people have welcomed Indochinese attainments but violence imperils this sympathy, and U.S. is informing France similarly. The U.S. is not making formal intervention at this time. Acheson 305 to Saigon, 5 December 1946 85 58. U.S. feels France would engage in full scale military operations in Vietnam only if forced, since they realize it is no longer possible to maintain a closed door. However, Cochin-China political question must be settled and French cannot resolve it without a fight. The Cochin-Chinese prefer Tonkin to France. Reed 472 to Byrnes, 6 December 1946. 87. 59. Secretary Byrnes reviews basic French-Vietnamese difficulties for Missions at London, Moscow, and Nanking. Essentially, the difficulties revolve around deep nationalist sentiment and opposition to the French, guided by a few communist trained leaders in the government with apparent contacts with Moscow and Yenan. However, "French influence is important not only as an antidote to Soviet influence, but to protect Vietnam and SEA from future Chinese imperialism." Three basic troubles are mutual distrust, French irresolution of the term "free state," and Vietnamese intransigence. Byrnes message to certain Missions, 17 December 1946 88 60. Byrnes reviews recent French political crisis and influence of Indochina policy as an important factor. Outbreak of hostilities in Hanoi seen as serious and not likely to be resolved by Moutet and d'Argenlieu. Byrnes message to Moscow, Nanking and Saigon, 20 December 1946 90 61. Vincent informs Acheson that with inadequate forces and divided public opinion, the French have tried to accomplish in Indochina what a strong, united . Britain found unwise to attempt in Burma. In short, "guerrilla warfare may continue indefinitely." The  .      Page French should be informed of U.S. concern, especially since the conflict may come before . the UN or other powers may intervene. Memorandum by Vincent for Acheson, 23 December 1946 91 62. U.S. advances reasons why the Vietnamese attacked the French on 19 December (a) orders from Moscow to upset Southeast Asia, or to increase Communist Party strength in France as a result of a quick settlement if the CP should take power from Blum; and (b) hope for similar Javanese-Dutch settlement resulting from fighting while negotiating. O'Sullivan 154 to Byrnes, 23 December 1946.. 92 63. U.S. impresses concern over Tonkin events on the French, but expresses no offer to mediate. U.S. is concerned that the UN might become involved. Byrnes 6586 to Caffery, 24 December 1946 93 64. U.S. takes the position to oppose Chinese proposals for intervention in Indochina. Acheson 8317 to Gallman (UK), 27 December 1946.. 95 65. Reed, in discussing with whom Moutet can deal, offers creation of new government under Bao Dai andor Tam. Reed 499 to Byrnes, 30 December 1946 95 66. The U.S. approves the Consul in Hanoi to act on humanitarian grounds to save lives, but cautions not to become involved in any situation which could be interpreted as mediating basic political issues without express authorization. Byrnes 25 to O'Sullivan, 31 December 1946... 96 1947 67. The U.S. reasserts the non-involvement policy of approving sales of military arms and armaments to France except in cases which relate Indochina, hostilities. Byrnes 75 to Paris, 8 January 1947. 97 68. U.S. expresses support and full recognition of France's posxtion; however, the U.S. cannot overlook dangerous outmoded colonial French methods. On the other hand, the U.S. does not desire that France be replaced by Kremlin communism as evidenced by Ho Chi Minh connections. The U.S. does not favor UN intervention, but "frankly we have no solution of the xi  .      Are problem to suggest." George C. Marshall, Secretary of State, 431 to Paris, 3 February 1947 98 69. The U.S. is concerned that the western democratic . system is on the defensive in emerging nations and Southern Asia is.in a critical phase. The key to the U.S. position is an awareness that in respect to the position pf western democratic powers in Southern Asia, the United States is in the same boat as the French, British and the Dutch, "we cannot conceive setbacks to the long range interests of France which would not also be setbacks of our own." The U.S. is ready to be helpful in any way, however, non-intervention is still the U.S. policy. Marshall 1737 to Paris, 13 May 1947 100 70. The State Department is concerned that a rumored, dry season French offensive would have repercussions in a Congress which will be called on for extensive financial aid to western Europe in light of Frances economic, financial, and food position. Marshall 3433 to Paris, 11 September 194-7... 103 71. M. Bollaert, French High Commissioner in Indochina, delivers publicly the most important declaration of French policy since before hostilities broke out. The French ask for a Vietnamese "representative government" to accept French terms, and exclude dealing with Ho Chi Minh except as a last resort, and then only for his surrender. The U.S. sees this policy resulting from a strengthened France (and a proportional unwillingness to make concessions) as a "retreat" from the March 6 accords. O'Sullivan letter to Marshall, 12 September 194? 104 72. The French deny any planned dry season military offensive. Caffery 3715 to Marshall, 12 September 1947 Ill 73. France considers Bollaert's policy speech as a step forward on two points formal abandonment of Indochina federation idea, and acceptance of the principle of union of the three KYs without a referenda. Caffery 3753 to Marshall, 14 Sept ember 1947 II? 74- The Chinese view French policy as making the position of U.S. and China difficult and do not see a successful government without participation of Ho Chi Minh. The "Chinese people" would not re- gard a Bao Dai monarchy favorably. Though his .  A. J. X'.      Page personality and ability are impressive, Ho Chi Minh is regarded as a communist, and his regime on Chinas south border does not appear of critical importance. Stuart (Nanking) 2096 to Marshall, 18 October 1947... 114 . 1948 75. India hesitates to submit Indochina question to the UN because France could veto and the GOI is not convinced that Vietnam Ho Chi Minh exercises de facto authority or represents majority viewpoint in Indochina. Marshall telegram to Consular Officers, 29 January 1948... 116 76. A Ho Chi Minh lieutenant is reported going to India with a petition for UN intervention. Marshall 21 to Saigon, 3 February 1948.. 117 77. Hanoi Consul summarizes recent events centering on Bao Dai signing Bai d'Along conference accords. Bao Dai withdraws commitment and will stay in France until called for as "emperor." Rendall (Hanoi) 31 to Marshall, 19 February 1948. 118 78. French Government authorizes Bollaert to approve formation of a provisional Vietnamese government headed by General Xuan. Caffery 2567 to Marshall, 12 May 1948... 120 79 Xuan government arouses very little enthusiasm. Bao Dai is waiting for favorable signs to return. Stuart 971 to Marshall, 29 May 1948 121 80. French indicate dubious chances of success for Xuan Government. Caffery 3063 to Marshall, 9 June 1948. 123 81. Chinese desire U.S. views on Ho Chi Minh's communist connections as an indicator of U.S. attitudes and ultimate policy vis-a-vis the Viet Minh. Stuart (Nanking) 1116 to Marshall, 22 June 1948... i pg 82. U.S. position on Ho Chi Minh is that he is a communist with a well-jknown record in the Comintern, but no evidence of a lirect link to Moscow. Marshall 974 to Nanking, 2 July 1948.. 27 83. U.S. believes that given present world political and economic conditions, French cannot possibly amass sufficient strength for a military solution to Indochina. Marshall 2466 to Paris, 3 July 1948.. q xiii       tse 84. Caffery suggests that the U.S. inform the French that they are faced with alternatives of approving Viet independence, union of three KYS or losing Indochina. Caffery 3o21 to Marshall, 9 July 1948 85. U.S. approves Cafferys suggested action (tel 3621) and would publicly approve of French actions on CochinChina status as a forward looking step toward settlement in Indochina. Marshall2637 to Paris, 14 July 1948 135 86. U.S. feels that France is evading the issue of altering the French Colony status of Cochin-China which, in effect, nullifies the Baied'Along agreement. Marshall 2891 to . Paris, 29 July 1948 136 87. The French Assembly must face the issue of changing Cochin-China status and approve Baie dAlong agreements, if the little progress in Indochina is not to be nullified, is the view of the French Ministry of Overseas Territories. Caffery 4034 to Marshall, 5 August 1948 137 88. U.S. seeks to determine, in the absence of firm commitments, how France can dispel Vietnamese distrust of French, split off adherents of Ho, or reduce hostili- ties. Marshall 136 to Saigon, 27 August 1948 138 89. U.S. believes "nothing should be left undone which will strengthen truly nationalist groups" in the steadily deteriorating Indochina situation. Marshall 3368 to Saigon, 30 August 1948 140 90. The U.S. publicly recognizes major strategem of communis ts in Southeast Asia is to champion the cause of local nationalism. Lovett 149 to Saigon, 22 September 1948 141 91. U.S. policy statement on Indochina cites four long-term objectives in Indochina (1) eliminate communist influence, (2) foster association of the people with western powers, particularly France, (3) raise the standard of living, and (4) to prevent undue Chinese penetration. The immediate objective is to satisfactorily resolve the French-Vietnamese impasse. Department of State Policy Statement on Indochina, 27 Septemoer 1948 143 92. The U.S. view is that for Moscow "prospects are excellent that Ho Chi Minh will eventually force the withdrawal of the French and set up the first New Democratic Republicin Southeast Asia." Abbot (Saigon) despatch No. 195 to SecState, 5 November 1948 150 xiv  .      Page 1949 93. The U.S., in assessing Bao Dai, cannot "irretrievably commit U.S. to support of native government which... might become virtually puppet govt..." Lcvett (Acting SecState) 145 to Paris, 17 January 1949.. 152 94The U.S. cautiously avoids any premature endorsement of Bao Dai in order to retain freedom of action in face of French pessimism. Acheson (SecState) 70 to Saigon, 2 May 1949... 153 95. Abbot, Saigon Consul, reviews the entire Indochina situation (for the New Delhi Foreign Service Conference, February 1949) for the State Department. "The alternatives to the Bao Dai solution are either continued costly colonial warfare or French withdrawal leaving a communist-controlled government in a strategic area of Southeast Asia." Abbott despatch 93 to SecState, 5 May 1949 154 96. The U.S. desires the success of Bao Dai experiment and will extend recognition, as there appears no other alternative to the established communist pattern in Vietnam and possible communist success in China. Acheson 77 to Saigon, 10 May 1949 190 97- U.S. fears France is offering "too little too late" and the U.S. should avoid "a conspicuous position" of any kind. Acheson 83 to Saigon, 20 May 1949... 193 98. The U.S. feels that the question of Ho Chi Minhs nationalism versus communism is "irrelevant." "All Stalinists in colonial areas are nationalists." Acheson 14 to Hanoi, 20 May 1949... 196 99. The U.S. submits comments on the 8 March Franco-Bao Dai agreement to France. Essentially, the U.S., while hoping the 8 March agreements would succeed, is pessimistic that the requisite concessions will be made by France.

The U.S. regards establishment of Bao Dai as only the "first step" in the evolution of the Vietnam problem and that France will have to concede more to accommodate nationalists, webb (Acting) 145 to Rangoon, 20 June 1949.. 219 102. The Singapore Conference recommends that the U.S. join the UK in support of Bao Dai, that the French clarify Vietnam's legal status, that de facto recognition be granted on 1 Janu- ary 1950, and hopes that the U.S. would fulfill its UN duties . in event of an attack on Indochina. Bliss (London) A2O63 to SecState, 9 November 1949. 223 103- The National Security Council submits a report, "The Position of the United States with Respect to Asia," which, from a military view, indicates the "current basic concept of strategic offense in the 'west and a strategic defense in the East.' The importance of Southeast Asia is principally as an exporter of strategic materials -- tin, fibers, and  rubber." NSC 481, 23 December 1949. 225 104. The President approves the conclusions of NSC 481 as amended. The basic objectives cited are development of stable nations and sufficient military power to prevent communist expansion in Asia, reduction of USSR influence in Asia, and prevention of power relationships which could threaten the U.S. Specifically, in Indochina, the U.S. will use its influence to resolve the colonialist-nationalist . conflict. NSC 482, 30 December 1949.. 265 1950 105. The JCS reviews the current Mutual Defense Assistance Program and certain objectives evolve as the basis for future military assistance programs. A specific long range objective is "development of sufficient military power in selected nations of the Far East" to prevent encroachment by communism.

Acheson 59 to Saigon, 4 February 1950... 278 xvi        Page 108. Asiatic neighbors consider Bao Dai a French puppet. The U.S. should realize that ECA and military aid from the U. S. do not constitute decisive factors in Indochinas problems. Therefore the Griffin Mission should not commit ECA or military aid to French Indochina unless France "gives requisite public undertakings re further steps leading to status similar to Indonesia." Stanton (Bangkok) 160 to'Acheson, 17 February 1950... 280 109. The State Department submits to the NSC a report on "The Position of the United States with Respect to Indochina," which analyzes the problem to determine measures to protect U.S. security in Indochina and prevent communist expansion in the area. NSC No. 64, 27 February 1950.. 282 110. President Truman approves the designation of Mr. Robert A. Griffin as Chief of the Economic Survey Mission to Southeast Asia, with rank of Minister. Five basic objectives of the Mission are outlined (1) determine needed projects of political significance; (2) prepare for Point 4 programs; (3) advise local officials of methods and extent of participat ion in Point 4; (4) brief U.S. representatives; and (5) investigate regional aspects of technical assistance. Department of State letter to Griffin, 1 March 1950.. 286 111. The State Department maintains to the Department of Defense that Indochina is subject to immediate danger and is the "most strategically important area of Southeast Asia." Dean Rusk believes that the resources of the U. S. should be deployed to "reserve Indochina from further Communist encroachment." Dean Rusk, Deputy Undersecretary of State to General James H. Burns, Defense Representative to Southeast Asia Aid Committee, 7 March 1950.. 288 112. Acheson instructs Saigon, in light of anticipated Franco- Viet friction on handling U.S. aid, that function of Griffin Mission is "clearly understood to be fact finding." Acheson 136-to Saigon, 9 March 1950.. 289 113. Griffin replies that "I understand that ours is an economic aid mission" and that the budding controversy could jeopardize the economic aid program. The French show no enthusiasm for Point 4. Gullion (Saigon) 176 to Acheson, 13 March 1950.. 290 114. Griffin submits his mission's preliminary conclusions on Indochina with a listing of specific urgent programs totaling $23.5 million exclusive of military aid and indirect xvii  I .

Obstacles should not permit indecision to allocate aid money or materials; the "crux of the situation lies in prompt decisive action if desired political effect is to be attained." Griffin file copy of telegram sent to Acheson, 16 March 1950 292 U5. The U.S. assumes.that France is determined to protect Indochina from communist encroachment, that success de' pends on indigenous support, and that France supports Bao Dai, but that the French position and ultimate intentions are not clear to the rest of the world. The U.S. requests France to make a public statement of the concessions to Indochinese nationalism. Acheson 1363 to Paris, 29 March 1950. 301 116. Acheson advisesGriffin Mission of the implications for U.S. policy in Vietnam (1) The prospect of U.S. aid indirectly would cause crisis (induce hyper-confidence in Viets); (2) Viets bitter at Huu appointment (and the U.S.) may magnify the U.S. role; (3) it is better for the U.S. if a national union government is set up; and (4) the aid program can more easily be worked out with Huu Government. Acheson 244 to Griffin, 9 April 1950... 305 117. Department of State requests an assessment of the strategic aspects of Indochina from a military point of view because of the threat of communist domination. The Joint Chiefs of Staff indicate that the "mainland states of Southeast Asia also are at present of critical strategic importance to the United States," because of the requirement to stockpile strategic materials acquired there, as well as the threat to other states on the "line of containment." JCS Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, 10 April 1950. 308 118. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur with the State Department on the importance of Southeast Asia to the U.S. However, the JCS urge a more forceful and positive U.S. position than expressed by State "in order to retrieve the losses resulting from previous mistakes on the part of the British and French, as well as to preclude such mistakes in the future, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it necessary that positive and proper leadership among the western Powers be assumed by the United States in Southeast Asia matters." <7CS Memorandum for SecDef, 2 M-.y 1950... 315 119- The JCS recommend telling the French that the U.S. is prepared to assist France and the three Associated States and that arrangements for U.S. military aid be made.

Griffin reconstructs the Indochina situation for Secretary Acheson. Griffin indicates that the present status quo cannot be maintained. "Time is of the essence" if Bao Dai starts to slip, "it will be impossible to restore him." Given that the French are aware that a military solution is unattainable,"the U.S. must find out what the French expect of Vietnam." Griffin Memorandum to Secretary of State, 4 May 1950... 322 122. The special survey mission headed by R. Allen Griffin recommends a modest$6O million economic and technical assistance program for Southeast Asia. State press release 485, 11 May 1950.. 327 123- The Ministers of the U.S., U.K., and France agree that while Southeast Asia is of strategic importance to the U.S., the direct responsibilities of U.K. and France make it of greater concern to them.

North Korea attacks South Korea and President Truman announces U.S. military assistance not only to South Korea but also an "acceleration in the furnishing of military assistance to the forces of France and the Associated States in Indochina and the dispatch of a military mission" Presidential Statement, 27 June 1950 336 128. The U.S. clarifies the principles governing U.S. military aid to Indochina. Essentially, the basic principles are U.S. aid supplements French assistance to Associated States  .

Acheson 4 to Saigon, 1 July 1950. 338 129. A summary of existing policy on Indochina reveals the JCS view on NSC 73 that the U.S. give consideration to providing air and naval assistance should the Chinese provide overt support to the Viet Minh. Consultants' Meeting, 25 July 1950.. 130. The U.S. feels that French requests for overall assistance (military, economic, and political) are inadequate to "consummate U.S. broad objectives in Indochina" and assistance will have to be increased to resist encroachment of communism. Heath (Saigon) 170 to Acheson, 7 August 1950 131. The U.S. views growing political and military deterioration in Indochina with concern; especially evident are failure of the government to gain- support, disinclination of Bao Dai to assume leadership role, and indications of CHICOM-Viet Minh military collaboration. The U.S. seeks to have Vietnam establish a national army and declare a national emergency. Acheson 238 to Saigon, 1 September 1950 132. The U.S. informs France that the U.S. was prepared to increase assistance to French Union forces but could not furnish money for local use or direct tactical air support. Extract of Summary Minutes of Tripartite, Foreign Ministers Meeting, France, U.K., and U.S., 14 September 1950 133. The Southeast Asia Aid Policy Committee (SEAC) proposes a statement of U.S. policy on Indochina to the NSC for consideration. "The U.S. will not commit any of its armed forces to the defense of Indochina against overt, foreign aggression" but should assist in the "formation of new national armies of the three Associated States." The U.S. should also "press the French" to carry out the agreements of 8 March 1949 and 30 December 1949- SEAC D-21, 11 October 1950. 134. "The draft statement of U.S. policy in Indochina is weak from the political sidethe Defense representatives argued for 1 strong, hardhitting policy cn political and . economic concessions. The State Department representatives flatly refusedto consider Indochina in that manner. Consequently, the paper ended with a compromise." K. T.

State and Defense recapitulate talks with the French Minis-ters, analyze Saigon's views on Indochina, and review the proposed NSC policy statement on Indochina The French had not programmed equipment for 18 battalions in the 1951 budget and further had requested that the U.S. pay for and maintain the National armies when formed. It appears that the French will withdraw from Tonkin and may throw the problem to the U.N. The draft policy statement is considered quite adequate. Memorandum for the Record (Mr. K.T. Young), 17 October 1950 373 137- The current situation in Indochina reveals serious weakness in French manpower, leadership, and intelligence. The Viet Minh forces are building up for large-scale offensives to seize complete control of Indochina. The French Union forces of 353,97 are opposed by 92,500 Viet Minh regulars and 130,000 irregulars. U.S. Naval Intelligence Memorandum, 17 October 1950 382 138. The U.S. informs Emperor Bao Dai, with emphasis, that it is imperative that he give the Vietnamese people evidence of his determination to personally lead his country into immed-iate and "energetic opposition" to the communist menace. The U.S. has interpreted his "prolonged holiday" on the Riviera as lack of patriotism. It is tactfully suggested that further displays of procrastination might lead to loss of U.S. support for his government. Acheson 384 to Saigon, 18 October 1950 388 139. A Defense view is that it is "most important that the French do. not quit cold and leave a political vacuum behind them." The U.S. should give increased military aid but not intervene and stress political steps by the French. Memorandum for Secretary Finletter, 19 October 1950 391 140.

Acheson 516 to UN, 22 November 1950.. 395 144. The U.S. publicly welcomes the French statement which assures independence of the Associated States of Indochina within the French Union and that their resources will be directed "to the defense of Indochina against communist colonialism." Department of State press release 1187, 27 November 1950 397 145. "If the Communists are successful in Korea, this may so weaken the French in Indochina that they will pull out. He Secretary Acheson doubted if any one of the Presidents advisers would urge him to intervene in that situation." Extract from Truman-Attlee Conversations, 4 December 1950.. 398 146. The Joint Chiefs of Staff position paper on possible future action in Indochina, 28 November 1950, is circulated for NSC consideration. This paper includes the Brink report (4 November 1950) as a reference. The JCS short term objectives emphasize urgent action to deny Indochina to communism, insure retention of responsibility by France, and development of an over-all military plan for Indochina. The long term objectives seek to prevent communist expansion, to establish internal security conditions such as the foreign armed forces would be' removed, to press the French to carry out commitments, and to establish a regional security arrangement in Southeast Asia. Executive Secretary to the NSC, NSC 641, 21 December 1950 399 1951 147. President Truman reasserts that U.S. aid to the French Union forces and National armies of the Associated States will continue.

The first progress report on NSC 64, which was approved on 27 March 1950, assesses the most severe threat to French Indochina as the increased capability of the Viet Minh resulting from Red Chinese aid. Optimistically, the report concludes that "American military aid furnished the State's forces and the Army of the French Union may have been the decisive factor in the preservation of the area against communist aggression."

General Bradley, while unable to commit or indicate the extent of U.S. military assistance in the event of CHICOM invasion, would recommend to the President that a declaration be issued to Red China that retaliation would follow any aggression. Acheson 974 to Saigon, 15 January 1952.. 465 161. The NSC considers the consequences to the United States of communist domination of Southeast Asia. Loss of Southeast Asia is seen as putting economic and political pressures on Japan, opening sources of strategic materials to the Soviet Bloc, rendering the U.S. position in the Pacific precarious and jeopardizing lines of communication and trade routes to South Asia. If Red China intervenes, the U.S. should take appropriate military action as part of a U.N. action or in conjunction with others but not unilaterally. Annex to NSC 124, 13 February 1952 468 162. The CIA estimates that a joint warning against CHICOM intervention in Southeast Asia would tend to deter them, that initiation of action in the U.N. would probably bring a response similar to that regarding Korea, and CHICOM defiance of a joint warning would probably involve prior consent of the USSR. CIA Special Estimate, SE-22, 29 February 1952. 477 163. The JCS views on NSC 124 and Annex to NSC 124 are that military operations in defense of Indochina against Chinese Communist invasion must be accompanied by action against Communist China itself a course of action which might result in a long and expensive war, and that from a military point of view, the JCS oppose acceptance of all the military commitments of NSC 124. JCS Memorandum for the SecDef (forwarded to the National Security Council), 3 March 1952.. 486 xxiv  I .      Page 164. The NSC recommends that the military implications of going to war in China be studied further and explained to the Council and the President; that the greater danger to Southeast Asia is subversion and not external aggression; and that contingencies for a French withnrawal be examined. NSC 113th Meeting (Item 3), 5 March 1952. 502 165.The U.S. stresses to the British that rumors of French intentions to withdraw or negotiate with Ho Chi Minh are not true. The U.S. believes that France will stay in Indochina as long as sufficient U.S. aid is forthcoming. Acheson Conversation with British Ambassador, 28 March 1952.. 508 166. French stress their problems at tripartite meeting concerning their EDC commitments (1) the French effort in Indochina, (2) financial difficulties and whether the strategic importance of SEA justified continued effort, and (3) Indochina is part of the European defense problem. France cannot continue to bear "alone such great share Indochinese burden." French attach great importance to U.S. aid. Acheson 7415 to State, 28 May 1952.. 5U 167. If the Chinese invade Indochina, "he Acheson said it was clear that it was futile and a mistake to defend Indochina in Indochina. He said we could not have another Korea we could not put ground troops in Indochinaour only hope was of changing the Chinese mind." Secretary of State Note (L.D. Battle), 17 June 1952.. 515 168.

Acheson publicly announces optimism over the conduct of the National armies in Indochina and that communist "aggression has been checked" and that the "tide is now moving in our favor." State Department Release 473, 18 June 1952... 518 170. The President approves NSC 1242 (NSC 1241 as amended) on the U.S. objectives and courses of action with respect to Southeast Asia. With respect to Indochina, the U.S. would continue to assure, the French of the international interest of the Indochina effort; use U.S. influence to promote poli-tical,military, economic,and social policies; provide increased aid in the absence of overt Chinese aggression; oppose French withdrawal; and seek collective action against Red China intervention. NSC 1242, 25 June 1952.. 520 xxv  I       Page 171. The U.S. and Britain discuss issuing a warning to Red China on intervention in Indochina. French successes could trigger Chinese intervention and the U.S. had "no infantry available for operations within Indochina." The U.S. thinking is along the lines of a naval blockade of Chinas coast.

Acheson 1286 to Saigon, 22 December 1952.. 540 .     1950 .     THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF Washington, D. C. 26 January 1950 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Military Objectives in Military Aid Programs The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the current Mutual Defense Assistance Program and have considered the military implications of future programs of this nature. From their study, they evolved the following objectives as the military basis for future military assistance programs. The long-range overall military objective of United States military defense assistance programs should be the development of conditions which will improve to the maximum extent possible, within economic realities both current and foreseen, the ability of the United States in event of war to implement in conjunction with its allies a long-range strategic concept. Briefly, that concept is that the United States, in collaboration with its allies, will seek to impose the a.t 1 ied war objectives upon the USSR by conducting a strategic offensive in western Eurasia and a strategic defensive in the Far East. Specific long-range objectives in furtherance of the overall military objective for future military defense assistance programs should be a. Development of sufficient military power in Western Europe to prevent loss or destruction of the industrial complexes in that region and to control those areas from which future operations can best be projected; b. The security and the use of Greenland, Iceland, the Azores, the United Kingdom, and French Northwest Africa; c. Denial to our enemy of naval and air bases in Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; d. Development of the Italian armed forces authorized by the peace treaty to their maximum strength and combat effectiveness. If peace treaty limitations are lifted, development of sufficient military power in Italy to delay materially and possibly to check Soviet invasion, to prevent loss of Sicily to an enemy, and to defend successfully those sea and air approaches within and adjacent to Italy which will be necessary for offensive operations; . ' 10? m 273 Declassified per Executive Ordcr 13526    e. Development of sufficient military power in selected nations of the Eastern Mediterranean-Middle East area to prevent Greece, Turkey, and Iran from capitulating to communism during the ideological conflict; and in event of war, to retain for the United States and its allies base areas in Turkey, to delay materially any USSR advance, possibly to deny to the enemy the oil resources and oil facilities of the Middle East and, with allied support; to assure control by the western powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and the security of base areas in Egypt; f. Development of sufficient military power in South Asia (India and Pakistan) to promote the internal security of the area and to assure its western orientationDevelopment of sufficient military power in selected nations of the Far East and the western Pacific Ocean area, to prevent further encroachment by communism in those areas; to insure, with the United States support, that in event of war, Japan, and the other Asian offshore islands, including the Philippines, are available for military use in order to constitute a multiple-front threat to the USSR, and by military action to delay any Communist invasion in other Far East and southeast Asia areas; and h. Development of sufficient military power in Latin America to insure the security of the area and its external lines of communications and to furnish military forces for which United States or other allied forces might otherwise be used. In connection with the foregoing specific military objectives for future military defense assistance programs, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would reaffirm their view that military cooperation between Spain and members of the North Atlantic security system would be in the security interests of the United States, western Germany, and Austria, when and if granted authority to rearm, should be included in this security system. In the security interests of the United States, sufficient military assistance should be provided to Yugoslavia to insure continued resistance to Moscow control since such an example of successful opposition might encourage movements of resistance to Moscow control in other satellite states. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are unable to predict the finite benefits to be achieved through the implementation of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949- They expect, however, that, as implementation progresses, the internal security situation of the recipient nations should improve concurrently. In addition, from the standpoint of United States military planning, increases in the armaments of the nations of  For the purposes of this paper, Far East is defined as that part of Asia east of India, including Burma, Malaya, Thailand, Indonesia, Indo-China, China, Japan, and eastern Siberia.      western Europe can be considered as a means of buying increased time for both preparations and movements, if there should be an invasion of that area. Further, the provision of new armaments of United States manufacture would serve to strengthen the industrial mobilization base of United States forces. The overall benefits tc be derived are cumulative but over a period of time must depend largely upon the self-help efforts of the recipient nations. The major portion of the funds appropriated in the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 is earmarked for members of the North Atlantic Treaty organization possessing major capabilities for self-help, while the Joint Chiefs of Staff cannot at this time recommend definite limitations on future assistance to these nations, they would suggest both progressive reductions in the aid to be provided in the future, and a time limit determined primarily by a. Planned force requirements; b. The world situation generally; . The finite benefits derived from each program toward the attainment of United States objectives; and d. The concrete demonstrations by recipient nations of . self-help toward their national and collective security. Further, and as a contingency in addition to a limit in time beyond which assistance to the North Atlantic Treaty members will not be extended, it should be emphasized the continuation of military aid even within that limit will be dependent upon the efforts for self-help and mutual aid exerted by each recipient nation since United States military aid can support but not replace efforts at self-help and will to resist.

Washington RESTRICTED February 2, 1950 HEMOrANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT Subject; U.S. Recognition of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia 1. The French Assembly (Lower House) ratified on 29 January by a large majority (596195) the bill which, in effect, established Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as autonomous states within the French Union. The opposition consisted of 181 Communist Votes with only 12 joining in from other parties. The Council of the Republic (Senate) is expected to pass the bills by the same approximate majority on or about February president Auriol's sionature is expected to follow shortly thereafter. 2. 'The French legislative and political steps thus taken will transform areas which were formerly governed as Protectorates or Colonies into states within the French Union, with considerably more freedom than they enjoyed under their prior status. The French Goyernment has indicated that it hopes to grant greater degrees of independence to the three states as the security position in Indochina allows, and as the newly formed o0Vernments become more able to administer- the areas folloving withdrawal of the French. 5. Within Laos and Cambodia there are no power-ful moVements directed against the gOVernments th ich are relatively stable. However, Vietnam has been the battle-ground since the end of World War II of conflicting political parties and military forces. Ho Chi Hinh, who under Various aliases, has been a communist agent in various parts of the world since l$2p and Ws able to take ouer the anti-French nationalist movement in 1-945 After failing to reach agreement with the French regarding the establishment of an autonomous state of Vietnam, he withdrew his forces to the jungle and hill areas of . Vietnam HE Sit IC TED 276      REST nIC TED . ' Vietnam and has harassed the French eVer since. His followers who are estimated at approximately 75,000 armed men, with probably the same number unarmed. His headquarters are unknown. The French counter efforts have included, on the military side, the deployment of approximately 150,000 troops, of whom the approximately 50,000 are local natiVes serving Voluntarily, African colonials, and a hard core mcde up of French troops and Foreign Legion units. Ho Chi Minh's guerrilla tactics have been aimed at denying the French control of Vietnam. On March 8, 1949 the French President signed an agreement with Bao Dai as the Head of State, granting independence within the E'rench Union to the Government of Vietnam. Similar agreements were signed with the king of Laos and the King of Cambodia. Recent developments have included Chinese Communist victories bringing those troops to the Indochins border; recognition of Ho Chi Minh as the head of the legal GoVernment of Vietnam by Communist China (18 January) and by SoViet nussia ($0 January). lj.. Recognition by the United States of the throe legally constituted goVernments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia appears desirable and in accordance with United States foreign policy for several reasons. Among them are encouragement to national aspirations under nonCommunist leadership for peoples of colonial areas in Southeast Asia; the establishment of stable non-Communist governments in areas -.Adjacent to Communist China; support to a friendly country which is also a signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty; and as a demonstration of displeasure with Communist tactics vhich are obviously aimed at eVentual domination of .Asia, working under the guise of indigenous nationalismSubject to your approval, the Department of State recommendsthat the United States of America extend recognition to Vietnam, Laos and Cmbodia, following ratification by the French GoVernment.

View imminent departure Griffin mission and indications in Department 95 of February 10, noon that firm decision may be in process of being taken re military and other aid to Indochina, I thought you might like to have my impressions from conference discussions and talks with Thailand Prime Minister and Foreign Minister during which Stanton, Jessup and I pressed hard for recognition. It is transparently clear that Asiatic neighbors of Indochina consider Bac Dai a French creation and a French puppet; despite current and anticipated actions of sup- port by US and Western powers they prepared sell his regime short, if status Bao Dai remains undrastically modified; even if such changes made premptly, he must exert effective leadership comparable to Ho's. We should realise that ECA and military aid from US, just as recognition by Us, do not constitute "missing components. While absence of ECA and military aid, just as lack recognition would prove disadvangtageous, under present circumstances they are not of primary importance and Will not constitute decisive factors. Conference found Gullion's analogy with Greece far from persuasive and, in fact, dangerous delusion    SECRET 2,-160, February 17, 10 p.m., from Bangkok "Missing component" is further action by French which would place Vietnam in category of independent states. Accordingly, Griffin mission should receive very precise and careful instructions prior to departure and it would be my recommendation that no ECA or military aid be com- mitted to French Indochina unless France gives requisite public undertakings re further steps leading to status similar to Indonesia. Current French intentions seem epitomized by Parodi's statement to Gullion (INTEL February 7, 7 a.m.,) that "French Parliament could not be told Indochina accord ratified February 2 of only passing value and it would do more harm than good kindle unrealistic appetites in Vietnam which Would necessarily be disappointed." Question, therefore, is what are the realistic nationalist; appetites which will not be disappointed. STANTON EHI. .cn SECRET 281 .     -;3C 64  February 27, 1950 . NOTE BY THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY to the NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL  on THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO INDOCHINA The enclosed report by the Department of State on the subject is submitted herewith for urgent consideration by the National Security Council and the Secretary of the Treasury. It is recommended that, if the Council and the Secretary of the Treasury adopt the enclosed report, it be submitted to the President for his consideration with the recommendation that he approve the Conclusions contained therein and direct their implementation by all appropriate executive departments and agencies of the U. S. Government under the coordination of the Secretary of State.  ) JAMES S. LAY, Jr. ExecutiVe Secretary c , i . I cc; The Secretary of the Treasury , NSC 64 282 TOP SECR-T       DRAFT REPORT BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL on THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO INDOCHINA THE PROBLEM 1. To undertake a determination of all practicable United States measures to protect its security in Indochina, and to preVent the expansion of communist aggression in that area. ANALYSIS 2. It is recognized that the threat of communist aggression' against Indochina is only one phase of anticipated communist plans to seize all of Southeast Asia. It is understood that Burma is weak internally and could be inuaded Without strong opposition or eVen that the GoVernment of Burma could be subverted. Hovever Indochina is the area most immediately threatened. It is also the only area adjacent to communist China Which contains a large European army, which along With natiye troops is noW in armed conflict ( Q With the forces of communist aggression. A decision to containcommunist expansion at the border of Indochina must be considered as a part of a wider study to preVent communist aggression into Q other parts of Southeast Asia.. 3. A large segment of the Indochinese nationalist mOVement was seized in 1945 by Ho Chi Minh, a Vietnamese Who under Various aliases has served as a communist agent for thirty years. He has attracted non-communist as well as communist elements to his. support, In 1946, he attempted, but failed to secure French agreement to his recognition as the head of a gOVernment of Vietnam. Since then he has directed a guerrilla army in raids against French installations and lines of communication. French forces which have been attempting to restore law and order found themselves pitted against a determined adversary Who manufactures effectiVe arms locally, who received supplies of arms from outside sources, Who maintained no capital or permanent headquarters and who was, and is able, to dis-bupt and-harass almost any area within Vietnam (Tonkin, Annam and Cochinchinu) at Will. 4. The United States has, since the Japanese surrender painted out to the French GoVernment that the legitimate nationalist aspirations of the people of Indochina, must be satisfied, and thatreturn to the prewar colonial rule is not possible. The Depart--t of state has pointed out to the French Government that it was " 4' .  283 .      v and is necessary to establish and support governments in Indochina ( ' particularly in Vietnam, under leaders who are capable of attracting to their causes the non-communist nationalist followers who had drifted to.the Ho Chi Minh communist moVement in the absence of any non-communist nationalist moVement around Which to plan their aspirations. 5. In an effort to establish stability by political means, where military measures had been unsuccessful, i.e., by attracting non-communist nationalists, now followers of Ho Chi Minh, to the support of anti-communist nationalist leaders, the French C-OVern-ment entered into agreements With the governments of the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia to eleVate their status from protectorates to that of independent states Within the French Union. The State of Vietnam, was formed, with similar status, out of the former French protectorates of Tonkin, Annam and the former French Colony of Cochinchino.. Each state receiVed an increased degree of autonomy and soVereignty. Further steps towards independence Were indicated by the French. The agreements were ratified by the French Goyern-ment on 2 February 1950. i . ! 6. The Governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were offi- cially recognized by the United States and the United Kingdom on February 7, 1950. Other Western poWers haye, or are committed to do likewise. The United States has consistently brought to the attention of non-communist Asian countries the danger of communist L . aggression which threatens them if communist expansion in Indochina ; is unchecked. As this danger becomes more eVident it is expected . to OVercome the reluctance that they have had to recognize and support the three new states. We are therefore continuing to press those countries to recognize the new states. On January 18, 1950, . i the Chinese Communist GoVernment announced its recognition of the Ho Chi Minh moVement as the legal GoVernment of Vietnam, while on January 30, 1950, the Soviet GoVernment, while maintaining diplomatic relations With France, similarly announced its recognition. 7. The newly formed States of Vietnam, L-os and Cambodia do not as yet have sufficient political stability nor military power to preVent the infiltration into their areas of Ho Chi Minhs forces. The French Armed Forces, while apparently effectiVCly utilized at the present time, can do little more than to maintain the status quo. Their strength of some 140,000 does, howeyer, represent an army in being and the only military bulwark in that area, against the further expansion of communist aggression from either internal or external force 5. 8. The presence of Chinese Communist troops along the border of Indochina makes it possible for arms, material and troops to mav-freely from Communist China to the northern Tonkin arsa now ccn- trolled by Ho Chi Minh. There is already Vidence of movement -f arms, I IISC 64 28 TOP       9. In the present state of affairs, it is doubtful that the combined natiVe Indochinese and French troops can successfully contain Hos forces should they be strengthened by either Chinese Communist troops crossing the border, or Communist-supplied arms and material in quantity from outside Indochina strengthening Hos forces. CONCLUSIONS 10, It is important to United States security interests that all practicable measures be taken to preVent further communist expansion in Southeast Asia. Indochina is a key area of Southeast t Asia and is under immediate threat. fA' 1u-' . ..11. The neighboring countries of Thailand and Burma could be expected to fall under Communist domination if Indochina were controlled by a Communist-dominated gOVernment. The balance of Southeast Asia would then be in grave hazard. 12. Accordingly, the Departments of State and Defense should prepare as a matter of priority a program of all practicable measures designed to protect United States security interests in Indochina. 1f 9 64 285       rmctaL communjcatioks to THE SECRETARY OF STATE In reply refer to IC DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON March 1, 1950 RESTRICTED The Honorable Robert Allen Griffin, Chief, Economic Survey Mission to the Southeast Asian Countries Sir I am pleased to inform you that the President has approved your designation as Chief of the Economic Survey Mission to the Southeast Asian Countries, with the personal rank of Ianistere There is enclosed the Presidents letter of appointment, This Mission has been established with the following basic objectives (1) To determine justifiable projects needed in the countries- to be visited for financing out of funds appropriated by Congress pursuant to Section 303 of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act which will have immediate political significances (2) To lay the groundwork for the anticipated Point 4 program in the Southeast Asian countries, l7ith special attention given to the problem o.C avoiding disillusionment by keeping proposed projects within "a proper perspective; (3) To advise the local authorities on the preparation for the Point 4 program, particularly with reference to the local conditions that will be required for Point 4. assistance, the extent and kind of participation which would be required of them in any joint project, and to the anticipated operating methods; (4) To brief the United States representatives in the area on current Department thinking regarding the anticipated Point 4 program; and (9) To investigate regional, aspects of technical assistance programse Mora detailed instructions for the conduct of this Mission will be furnished you in separate communications and may be supplemented from time to time by cable.

I belieVe that an examination of this statement will.facilitate your consideration of NSC 64. The Department of State continues to hold that Southeast Asia is in gray danger of Communist domination as a consequence of aggression from Communist China and of internal subVersiVe activities. The Department of State maintains that Indochina, subject as.it is to the most immediate danger, is the most strategically Important area of Southeast Asia, The Department of State believs that within the limitations imposed by existing commitments and strategic priorities, the resources of the United States should be deployed to reseryo Indo-chlna and Southeast Asia from further COmmunist encroachment, The- Department of State has accordingly already engaged all its political resources to the end that this object be secured. Tho -Department is now engaged la-the process of urgently examining what additional economic resources can effectively bo engaged in the same operation. " It is now, in the .opinion of the Department, a matter of the greatest urgency that the Department of Defense assess the strategic aspects of the situation and consider, from the military point of view, how the United States can best contribute to the preVention of further Communist encroachment in that area. The military assessment requested aboye is necessary to a final determination by this Government of the manner in which United States policy in this area shall be executed.

I understand that ours is an economic aid mission and our remarks in sense of paragraph 2 above have been confined to economic aid. However, two programs Should bo mutually supporting and will possibly overlap to some extent. Dept is entirely right in foreseeing grave friction on distribution of military aid.

That French understand that success of MIL operation, i.e. containnont of northern border against COMMIE penetration as wall as  reduction of Hos forces elsewhere IC, depends, in thc end on overcoming opposition of indigenous population, 3. Thoroforc Franco proposes in support of this policy to strengthon Bao Dai and the Kings of Laos and Cambcdia in ovory practical way, to end that non-COMMIE nationalists abandon Ho, support Eao Dai and Kings and can thus reduco guerrilla activity. It is evident from reaction Asian states to US and FR effort to secure their recognition Bao Dai, from attitude Scandinavian powcrs and from reactions US press that largo segnont public opinion both East and. West continues to regard Bao Dai and two Kings as French puppots not enjoying nor likely to cnjoy degreo of autonomy within FR Union accorded then under MAR 8 agreements, analogous to that accorded UDO by HETH.

Tho Thai Govt recognised thc Indochinoso states on FEB 28. Unfortunately, the US REES accroditod to tho rcnaining Asian countries have been informed by tho officials of those countries that they regard thc GOVTS of thc thrco states as FR puppets and that, norc important, they are not convinced of tho gcnuino character of FR intcntions ultimately to accord tho statos of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia tho full noasui'J's- of indopendcnce and sovereignty which have rccontly boon transferred by tho NETH to INDO. Tho rosponsiblc ministers of tho Asian powers concerncd have stated in substance that wore thc Republic of Franco to announce publicly that tho present agroendnts voro tho first steps in an orderly evolutionary precess, tho end and purpose of which is to accord tho throe states of Indochina conplotc indopendcnce, sovcroignty and administration of their own affairs (within tho FR Union), thosc Asiatic states WID bo prepared favorably to consider recognition of thc throe states in Indochina oven before such additional transfcrs of sovorcignty WID have actually boon nado. Therefore, while Dopt obviously unablc guarantee recognition and support fol such sthtcr.cnt, Dopt bolicvcs that in absence such statcncnt further acts of recognition by Asian statos not forthcoming. Dept keenly awarc of sclf-evident fact that INDOS cannot administer complexities Indochinoso affairs without FR assistance. Dopt dotornined as matter of goncral policy to emphasize intcrdcpcndcnco Franco and Indochina as was successfully dono in ease NETH and Indonesians. DEFT bclicvos that independence and autonomy of throe IG statos must clearly bo vndcrstocd to lio within FR Unione Tho GOVT of tho US is avero of tho concessions granted by thc Republic of Franco in nogotiating and ratifying tho Agrccncnts, Tho US GOVT has indicated to thc Govt of France its dcsiro to bo of assistanco to tho thrco statos and to thc FR ADMIH in Indochina in enabling than successfully to contain and liquidate connunisn in Indochina, Tho US GOVT is aware of tho fact that tho GOVT of Franco shores its concern that conrtunisn bo excluded not only from Indochina but from thc entire SEA region. Tho exocution of this policy requires, above all things, a unanimity of support on tho part of tho nations of SEA of tho anti-COMMIE Indochinoso nationalist GOVTS of Indochina, QTE With full consciousness of thc difficulties involved, tho US GOVT requests thc Govt of Franco soriously to consider tho issuance at tho earliest possible noncnt of a public statonent of tho character identified in tho foregoing.

As Bao Dai points out, principal soft spot is in south and Enu has reel prestigue knows how to make influence felt in villages has large amount Catholic support, has country man's touch despite wealth. Bao Daists may nice join govt. Huu claims to have abstained from joining earlier cabinents and his coming into new goverment shows he thinks Bao Dai-Fr partnership going concerns especially with US as silent partner3. Believe it will be easier negotiate aid formulas with Hun govt than Long not only because Long and Pignon crossed swords on matter but because Hun considerably more realistic. Long wanting to stay on would probably have grasped any aid formula given him by America.      4. Long failed for variety reasons his personality rubbed people wrong way he had few contemporaries in Cevt (63 is ancient in he tried to run four jobs himself. He could not conciliate Tonkin, he did not work miracle in applying Mar 8 agreement he had luck in having riot break break out Mar 19 (for which local officials more responsible than he) causing Viets less face before America. UNFAILED(daily?) his enemies taxed him with this and with failure to put on big show Griffin Mission. Finally he humiliated publicly at final five cornered meeting Griffin Mission. 5. Fr would probably never admit letter influenced them but it did. have powerful leverage on any govt in controlling rate of transfer of powers under Mar 8 agreement and execution of supplementary accords. If a Vietnam govt does not get powers rapidly from Fr it cames underi cross-fire of own people and Fr. situation Fr can maneuver? to nicety. Of course this cannot be done indefinitely. Exact manner and extent to which it occured this time may never be known but Bao Dai's and Long's accounts sufficiently circumstantial to indicate something like this happened. Nothing so crude as dictum by Pignon or consultation of hum by Bao Dai took place. Think Fr would undoubtedly have preferred preferred diem but Bao Dai opposed, face saving continuances Long over Easter probably also his idea. 6.

Do not believe we should go behind innocent inquires and disingenuous hints for time being. D. Aid program can be worked out more easily Hun govt. But fact Fr appear to have promoted change at least partly because Long's insistence on Viets receiving aid directly should cause US stick to our guns in establishing formula givin Viets adequate recognition and participation.

'COPY  )April 1950 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (SECDEF SUBJECT Strategic Assessment of Southeast Asia' The Joint Chiefs of Staff haV studied your memorandum, dated 10 March 1950, with its enclosures, in which you requested their Views regarding a. The strategic importance, from the military point of view, of Southeast Asia; b. NSC 64, a report by the Department of State on the position of the United States with respect to Indochina, , Which is noW before the National Security Council for consideration; . The measures that, from the military point of vieW, might bo taken to preVont Communist expansion into South- east Asia; d. The order of magnitude and means of implementation of such measures; and e. A French aide-memoire on the subject of aid for Indocnina, dated 16 February 1950.  1, In light of U.S. strategic concepts, the integrity of the offshore island chain from Japan to Indonesia is of critical strategic importance to the United Statest 2. The mainland states of Southeast Asia also are at present of critical strategic importance to the United States because a. They are tho major scurces of certain strategic materials required for tho completion of United States stock pile projects; ' b. The area is a crossroad of communications; p. Southeast Asia is a Vital segment in the line of containment of communism stretching from Japan southviurd and around to the Indian Peninsula. The security of the throe Seo letter from Mr. Rusk to General Burns, dated March 7, 1950, reproduced at the ond of this memorandum .      o major non-Communist base areas in this quarter of the world-Japan, India, and Australia--depends in a large measure on the denial of Southeast Asia to the Communists. If Southeast Asia is lost, these three base areas will tend to -be Isolated from one another; d. The fall of Indochina would undoubtedly lead to the fall of tho other mainland statos of Southoaat Asia. Thoir fall would;  (1) Require changing the Philippines and IndOnesia from supporting positions in the Asian offshore island chain to front-line bases for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. It would also cull for a reView of the strategic deployment of United States forces in the Far East; and (2) Bring about almost- immediately a dangerous condition With respect to the internal security of the . Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia, and would contribute to their probable eyentual fall to the Communists; e. The fall of Southeast Asia would result in the virtually complete denial to the United States of the Pacific littoral of Asia. Southeast Asian mainland areas are important in the conduct of operations to contain Communist expansion; f. Communist control of this area would alleViate con- siderably the food problem of China and would make ayailable to the USSR important strategic materials. In this connection, SoViet control of all the major components of Asians war potential might become a decisive factor affecting the balance of power between the United States and the USSR. "A Sowiet position of dominance OVer Asia, Western Europe, or both, would constitute a major threat to United States security"; and g. A SoViet position of dominance over the Far East would also threaten the United States position in Japan since that country could thereby be denied its Asian markets, sources of food and other raw materials. The feasibility of retention by the United States of its Asian offshore island bases could thus be jeopardized. 3. In the light of tho foregoing strategic considerations pertaining to thc area of Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of view, concur in the conclusions in NSC' 64. 4. Military forces of both Franco and the United Kingdom are now actively opposing communism in Southeast Asia. Small indigenous 309       ; Q  forces are allied with them. In addition, the generally inadequate indigenous forces of tho independent states are actively engaged in attempting to maintain internal security in the face of Communist . aggression tactics, 5. It appears obvious from intelligence estimates that the situation in Southeast Asia.' has deteriorated and, without United States assistonnce, this deterioration will be accelerated. In general, the basic conditions of political and economic stability in this area, as well as the military and internal security conditions, are unsatisfactory. These factors are closely interrelated and it is probable that, from the lOng-term pOint of View, political and economic stability is the controlling factor. On the other, hand, the military situation in some areas, particularly Indochina, is of pressing urgency. 6. ..-With respect to the measures which, from the United States military point of View-, might be taken to preVent Communist 1 expansion in Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend OanlVIpPlenie1tajLioIloftmi aid programs for Indochina, ' Indonesia, Thailand, the PhilippTnSsTand Burma. Malaya might also bo included provided the British by their actions in the areas in Asia Where they haye primary interest eVince a deter-, mined effort to resist the expansion of communism and present . sufficient military justification for aid. The effectiVeness of these military aid programs would be greatly increased by appropriate public statements of United States policy in Southeast Asia. 7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the military aid j from funds already allocated by the President for the states V of Southeast Asia be deliVered at the earliest practicable date. They further recommend that the presently unallocated portion of the Presidents emergency fund undor Section 303 of Public Lav 329 (8lst Congress, lst Session), be planned and programmed as a matter of urgency. 8. Precise determination of the amounts required for military aid, special covert operations, and concomitant economic and psychological programs in Southeast Asia cannot be made at this . time since the financial requirements will, to a large extent, depend on the success of aid and other programs now in the process of implementation. In the light of the world situation, hovreVer, it would appear that military aid programs and other measures will be necessary in Southeast Asia at least during the next fiscal ye r and in at least the same general oyer-all order of magnitude. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, therefore, strongly recommend that appropriations for OVer-all use in the general area of Asia be sought for the next fiscal year in terms similar to those under Section. 303 of Public Law 329 (8lst Congress, lst Session). It is bol.'-oved that approximately $100,000,000 will be required for tho military portion of this program.       ;  '9. In view of the history of military aid in China, the 1Joint Chiefs of Staff urge that these aid programs be subject, in any eVent, to tho following conditions; a. That United States military aid not be granted un- . condibiona.lly; rather, that it be carefully controlled and 1 that the aid program be Integrated With political and economic programs; and . .i b. That requests for military equipment be screened first by an officer designated by the Department of Defense and on duty in the recipient state. These requests should be . subject to his determination as to the feasibility and satisfactory coordination of specific military operations. It should bo understood that military aid will only be con-siderod in connection with such coordinated operational plans as are approved by the representative of the Department of Defense on duty in the recipient country. Further, in conformity with current procedures, thc final approval of all programs for military materiel will be subject to the ! concurrence of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. , 10. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that a Southeast Asia Aid Committee be appointed with State, Defense and ECA representation Which will be responsible for the deVelopment and implementation of the program for th general area of Southeast Asia, Requests for aid should bo screened by the field representatives of the committee in consultation with the local authorities in the countries concerned. 11, Present arrangements for military aid to Indonesia through the military attaches and to the Philippines through the Joint -United States Military Aid Group appear to be satisfactory and should be continued. ' 12. A small military aid group should be established in Thailand to operate in conformity with the requirements in paragraph 9 abOVe. Arrangements for military aid should be made directly . with the Thai GoVernment13. In View of the very unsettled conditions in Burma, the program for military aid to that country should, for the time being at least, be modest. The arrangements Should bo made after consultation with the British, and could well be handled by the United States Armed Forces attaches to that country. Arrangements for military aid to Malaya, if and when authorized, should be handled similarly except that request should, in the first instance, originate with British authorities14. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize the political implica- tions inVolvcd in military aid to Indochina. It must be appreciated,  .      . hovever, that French armed forces of approximately 140,000 men arc- in the field and that if these were to be withdrawn this year because of political considerations, the Bao Dai regime probably could not suryiVe even with United States aid. If the United States Were noW to insist upon independence for Vietnam and a phased French withdrawal from that country, this might . improVe the political situation. The French could be expected to interpose objections to, and certainly delays in, such a program. Conditions in Indochina, however, are unstable and tho situa-tion is apparently deteriorating rapidly so that tho urgent need for at least an initial increment of military and economic aid is psychologically OVerriding. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, therefore, recommend the proVision of military aid to Indochina at the earliest practicable date under a program to implement the President's action approVing the.allocation of 15 million dollars for Indochina, and that corresponding increments of political and economic aid be programmed on an interim basis Without prejudice to the pattern of the policy for additional military, political and economic aid that may be developed later. 15. In VieW of the considerations set forth in paragraph 14 abOVe, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the immediate estab-z lishment of a small United States military aid group in Indochina, to operate in conformity vzith the requirements in paragraph 0 abOVe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff would expect the senior member . of this group to sit in consultation with military representatives of Fro.nce and Vietnam a.nd possibly of Laos and Cambodia. In addition to screening requests for materiel, he would be expected to insure full coordination of military plans and efforts between the French and Vietnamese forces and to superVise the allocation of materiel. The Joint Chiefs of Staff belieVe in the possibiltiy of success of a prompt coordinated United States program of mili- tary, political, and economic aid to Southeast Asia and feel that such a success might well lead to the gaining of the initiative in the struggle in that general area. i 16. China is the Vital strategic area in Asia. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are firmly of the opinion that attainment of United States objectives in Asia can only be achieved by ultimate success in China. Resolution of the situation facing Southeast Asia would therefore, be facilitated if prompt and continuing  measures wore undertaken to reduce the pressure from Communist China. In this connection., the Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted the Vidences of renevred vitality and apparent increased effectiVeness of the Chinese Nationalist forces. I?. The Joint Chiefs of Staff suggest the folloving measures with.military implications a. An increased number of courtesy or "show the flag" visits to Southeast Asian states; . 312 .        < b. Recognition of the "port closure" of Communist China seaports by the Nationalists as a de facto blockade so long as it is effective. Such action should remoVC some of the pressure, direct and indirect, upon Southeast Asia; should be of assistance to the anti-Communist forces engaged in interference With the lines of communication to China; and should aggravate the economic problems and general unrest in Communist China; . A program of special coyert operations designed to interfere with Communist activities in Southeast Asia; and d. Long-term measures to provide for Japan and the other offshore islands a secure source of food and other strategic materials from non-Communist held areas in the Far East, 18. Comments on the French aide-memoire of 16 February 1950, are contained in the substance of this memorandum. The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not concur in the French suggestion for conversations between the "French and American General Staffs" on the subject of Indochina since the desired ends will best be served through conferences in Indochina among the United States military aid group and military representatives of France, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not unmindful of the need for collaboration and consultation with the British and French GoVernments on Southeast Asia matters and < recommend, therefore, that military representatiVes participate in the forthcoming tripartite discussions on Southeast Asia to be hold at the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Ministers.

Among other things, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stressed in their memorandum a. The urgent need for early arrival of military aid; b. The requirement that such aid be integrated with political and economic programs; and c. That a small United States military aid group be established in Indochina immediately for the purpose of (1) Screening requests for military material, the requests to be subject to determination by the senior member thereof as to the feasibility and satisfactory coordination of specific military operations; (2) Insuring full coordination of military plans and efforts between the French and Vietnamese forces; and (3) Supervising the allocation of material to those forces.

The seventh unnumbered paragraph under the heading Background should be revised along the following lines The "missing component" in the picture consists of three factors, namely, political, military, and economic. The first two are at present the most important and should be emphasized. In the military field the greatest defect has probably been the lack of coordination between the French and the indigenous forces, coupled with immediate deficiencies in various items of equipment and material and with uncertain morale on the part of the Indochinese and the French. Very early, and continuing assistance is needed by the Indochinese and the French forces in order to meet their present needs. Such assistance must consist in general of additional equipment within reason (unavailable to the French from other sources) and of appropriate military advice. b. The second unnumbered paragraph under the heading Discussion should be revised along the following lines The success of the military program depends upon the support given by the French, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians to the coordinated operations plans prepared in Indochina, and, to a lesser extent, upon the receipt of specific items of military material from the United States. In view of the larger aspects of the struggle against world communism, judicious political concessions in Indochina by the French, and timely and adequate, but controlled, aid on the part of the United States will eventually pay dividends to both. c. Under Recommendations, the paragraph headed Discussions with the French should be revised to (1) Incorporate in Recommendation 2) a provision that the arrangements for United States military aid be made in Indochina as a result of conversations there between United States, French, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian military representatives; and . SECRET      C-O-P-Y SECRET (2) Change Recommendation 5) so as to make unmistakable the firm desire of the United States to send a military aid group to Indochina at the earliest possible date for the purposes indicated in your memorandum to the Secretary of State, dated 14 April 1950. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs ofStaff regard with strong disfavor the desires and continued attempts of the French to settle, on the political level, the military and internal security problems of Indochina in Paris. Recognizing their own responsibilities in the matter, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the point of view of the military security interests of the United States, again urge the immediate establishment of an authoritative United States military aid group in Indochina. For the Joint Chiefs of Staff s Omar N. Bradley OMAR N. BRADLEY, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.      THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF Washington, D.C. 2 May 1950 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Southeast Asia 1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have formulated the following comments, from the military point of view, on the Department of State draft position paper entitled "Southeast Asia" (EM D C-2a, dated 25 April 1950). 2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur fully in the expressions in the subject paper as to the importance of the area of Southeast Asia to the United States. They concur in general as to the need for British and French action along the lines indicated in the draft position pa-per. Moreover, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the currently unfavorable situation in Southeast Asia, an area important both to the United States and to the Communist movement, warrants assumption by the United States of a much more forceful and positive position than is expressed or implied in the draft position paper. 3. As stated in the CONCLUSIONS in NSC 68, "Our position as the center of power in the free world places a heavy responsibility upon the United States for leadership, we must organize and enlist the energies and resources of the free world in a positive program for peace which will frustrate the Kremlin design for world domination by creating a situation in the free world to which the Kremlin will be compelled to adjust. Without such a cooperative effort, led by the United States, we will have to make gradual withdrawals under pressure until we discover one day that we have sacrificed positions of vital interest." 4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the United States and the other western Powers should take immediate and positive steps to achieve the initiative in the present conflict. Further, they consider that success in Southeast Asia might well lead to the gaining of the initiative in the struggle within the Far East. 5. In light of the foregoing and in order to retrieve the losses resulting from previous mistakes on thepart of the British and the French, as well as to preclude such mistakes in the future, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it necessary that positive and nroper leadership among the Western Powers be assumed by the United States in Southeast Asia matters. They, therefore, recommend that the draft position paper on "Southeast Asia" be revised along the lines of NSC 68 and paragraph 4 above. COPY      6. In addition to the foregoing general recommendation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would make the following specific recommendation regarding that part of the third paragraph of the subject paper headed-REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS which states "For the United States to underwrite a regional coalition including Japan,'the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand does not increase American commitments; we must accept responsibility for assisting in the defense of these powers against aggression." The Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of view, disagree in principle with such a single far-flung regional arrangement and do not concur in the statement that American commitments would not be increased by underwriting such a coalition. The Joint Chiefs of Staff would from the military point of view agree to appropriate military arrangements between nations in Southeast Asia capable of effective mutual support. 7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to reaffirm their views on this subject as transmitted by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of State on 14 April, and reemphasize the need for immediate consideration and implementation of an integrated and effective U.S. course of action for Southeast Asia.

Although the security of South Last Asia is of strategic importance to the United States, the British and French hste direct responsibilities in the area which make its security of even greater concern to them. The forcible expulsion of French and British forces from lndo-China and malaya, respectiVely, would be both a military and political disaster. The United Kingdom therefore reaffirms its intention to continue to discharge its responsibilities in British and British-protected territory in the area. The French Government considers that it is only within the framework of close and actiVe coopbration vi th the United Kingdom and United States Governments that it will be able to continue effectiVely to discharge its particular responsibilities in this region."

There was the particular question of relations with Pakistan, India and Ceylon. He would prefer not to make a declaration of any sort. M. SCHUMAN said that thc French view vias still that a Joint declaration should be made. However, he recognises the difficulties of the United Kingdom position. M.

FOR THE PRESS MAY 25, 1950 No. 545 U.S. FORMALLY ANNOUNCES INTENT TO ESTABLISH AN ECONOMIC AID MISSION TO THE THREE ASSOCIATED STATES OF INDOCHINA On Wednesday, May 24, Charge daffaires Edmund Gullion delivered the following letter to . the Chiefs of State of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia or their representatiVes at Saigon. Simultaneously, Ambassador Bruce delivered an identical letter to the President of the French Union in Paris. The text of the letter follows "I have the honor to inform you that the GoVernment of the United States has decided to initiate a program of economic aid to the States of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. My Government has reached this decision in order to assist Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to restore stability and pursue their peaceful and democratic development. "With these purposed in mind, the United States Government is establishing, with headquarters in Saigon and associated with United States Legation, a special economic mission to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. This mission vzill haye the responsibility of working with the GoVernments of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and with the French High Commissioner in developing and carrying out a co- . ordinated program of economic aid designed to assist the three countries in restoring their normal economic life. The members of the American economic mission will at all times be subject to -the authority of the GoVernment of the United States and will not become a part of the administrations of the Associated States. 'The GoVernment of the United States recognizes that this American assistance will be complementary to the effort made by the three AssocSied States and France, vrithout any intention of substitution. American aid is designed to reinforce the joint effort of France and the gOVernm.ents and peoples 332      of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, on whom rests the primary responsibility for the restoration of security end stability. "United States economic aid will be granted in accordance with separate bilateral agreements bet',toon each of the Associated States and tho United States of America. The approVal of these agreements will be subject to legal conventions existing betvzeen the .Associated States and France. Initial economic aid operations, howeVer, may begin prior to the conclusion of these agreements. c "The United States GoVernment is of the opinion that it would be desirable for the three gOVernments and the French High Commissioner to reach agreement among themselves for the coordination of those matters relating to the aid program that are of common interest. The American economic mission will maintain contact with the three Asso-dated States, with the French High Commissioner in Indochina and, if desired, with any body which may be sot up by the Associated States and France in connection with the aid program. "Mr. Robert Blum has been appointed Chief of the United States special economic mission to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. "Identical letters are being addressed today ' -to the gOVernments of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the President of the French Union," The letter of intent refers only to economic aid which will be based on the recommendations of the Griffin mission Which recently made a suruey trip to Southeast Asia and carried on consultations with the leaders and technicians of Indochina. Secretary of State Dean Acheson announced the policy of United States aid to Indochina at Paris on May 8 when he released this statement following an exchange of Views with Foreign Minister Schuman of France . "The Foreign- Minister and I have Just had an exchange of views on tho situation in Indochina and are in general agreement both as to the urgency of the situation in that area and as to the 333      necessity for remedial action. We haVe noted the fact that the problem of meeting the threat to the securityoof Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos Which now enjoy independence within the French Union is primarily the responsibility of France and the gOVernments and peoples of Indochina. The United States recognizes that the solution of the Indochina problem depends both upon the restoration of security and upon the dovelopment of genuine nationalism and that United States asSistance can and should contribute to those major objectiVes. "The United States GoVernment conVinced that neither national Independence nor democratic evolution exist in any area dominated by Soviet imperialism, considers the situation to be such as to warrant its according economic aid and military equipment to the Associated States of Indochina and to France in order to assist them in restoring stability and permitting these states to pursue their peaceful and democratic deVelopment." .     DEPARTMENT OF STATE FOR THE PRESS JUNE 3, 1950 NO. 5q3 The following is the text of a letter of June 2 from Secretary of State Dean Acheson to the Honorable Robert Allen Griffin, upon the conclusion of his assignment as Head of the Special Economic Mission to Southeast Asia "Dear Mr. Griffin "I congratulate you upon the successful conclusion of the Special Economic Mission to Southeast .Asia which you lc-d and extend to you and those on your staff my warmest personal thanks for the careful and thorough Job you did. In surveying so large an area under conditions which called for constant diplomatic tact and skillful technical appraisal under the severest time pressure you performed with outstanding ability a most difficult assignment. "On the basis of your recommendations the United States GoVernment is launching a program which will offer rapid economic aid to those countries for which you drew up plans. The purpose of this assistance, as you wall know, is to mobilise the natural and human resources of these countries for the improwemcnt of the general welfare of the people and the strengthening of democratic goVernments throughout Southeast Asia.

Thc Security Council of the. United Nations called upon the invading troops to cease hostilities and to withdraw to the 58th parallel. This they hawe not dons, but on the contrary have pressed the attack. The Security Council called upon all members of the United Nations to render eVery assistance to the United Nations in the execution of this resolution. In these circumstances I have ordered United States air and sea forces to give the Korean Government troops coyer and support. The attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that Communism has passed beyond the use of subVersion to conquer independent nations and vrill now use armed invasion and war. It has defied the orders of the Security Council of the United Nations issued to. preserVe international peace and security. In these circumstances the occupation of Formosa by Communist forces Would be a direct threat to the security of the Pacific area and to United States forces performing their lawful and necessary functions in that area. Accordingly,! haVe ordered the SeVenth Fleet to preVent any attack on Formosa. As a corollary of this action I am calling upon the Chinese GoVernment on Formosa to cease all air and sea operations against the mainland. The SeVenth Fleet will see that this is done. The determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations. I hawe also directed that United States Forces in the Philippines be strengthened and that military assistance to the Philippine GoVernment be accelerated. I have similarly directed acceleration in the furnishing of military assistance to the forces of " 336 .     France and the Associated States in Indo China and tho dispatch of a military mission to provide close working relations with those forces, i  I know that all members of the United Nations will consider carefully the consequences of this latest aggression in Korea in defiance of the Charter of thc United Nations. A return to the rule of force in international affairs would have far reaching effects. The United States will continue to uphold the rule of law.  J. have instructed Ambassador Austin, as the representatiVe of the United States to the Security Council, to report these steps to the Council. 337      SECRET 79lG.5'-MAP7l>0 Secret File OUTGOING TELEGRAM AMLEGATION, July 1, l950o SAIGONNoc hTOMAP ' ' '  DEPT desirea clarify principles governing US MIL aid Indochina and ascertain that all parties to agreement . fully understand and concur in arrangements for diVision of aid, TRANS of title, reception, distribution, accounting, maintenance and use this aid.

The French forces after approximately 5 years of warfare are stalemated against Eo Chi Minh and appear to haVe lost considerable amount of offensive spirit.

Schuman expressed his approval of the statements on Indo-China in the paper on Southeast Asia (Doc. 8, Sept.- 1, 1950)2. He wished, howeVer, to , make a few additional comments. France faVored large national armies in Indo-China. There were already 77,000 troops in the armies of the three Associated States and 44,000 Indo-Chinese nationals in the army of the French Union. Great diffi- culties were being encou ?ed in building up the , national armies. There vias difficulty in finding an adequate staff of trained officers and in financing the equipment for the troops. The French Union army in Indo-China now numbered 150,000 men. t Financing of this army also imposed a heavy burden on France and assistance vias urgently needed. The proximity of Communist China was an additional  threat which made it necessary for France to request direct tactical air support from the United States  in the event of Chinese Communist aggression. This was in addition to the present need of France for aircraft in Indo-China. Finally, in connection with the tripartite conversations mentioned in part B of Document 8( France would, selcome sic- in particu?.ar military talks to difcuss the means of meeting Chinese Communist attacks on Indo-China.

Mr. Acheson stated that his government at-tached the greatest importance to the increase of military forces in Indo-China, including both national and French Union forces. The U.S. had given substantial assistance in the past and was prepared to increase this assistance. As to financial aid, the United States would be able to furnish items of military equipment manufactured in the United States, but could not supply money to be used locally. Mr. Acheson stated that the United States could not furnish the direct tactical air support requested by M. Schuman. Finally, the military discussions described in Part B of Doc. 8 should take place soon in the Far East and should involve military commanders now engaged in operations in that area, to study, among other things, measures to be takenSECRET 3W       SEAC D-21, Rev. 1 October 11, 1950 SOUTHEAST ASIA AID POLICY COMMITTEE Proposed Statement of U,S. Policy on Indo-China for NSC Consideration The attached paper, prepared by the Department of Defense and the Office of Philippine and Southeast Asian Affairs of the Department of State, is a revision and expansion of the brief draft statement considered by the Committee on October 6. It is now being considered by the JCS. Martin G. Cramer Secretary COPY 3      MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARIES OF STATE AND DEFENSE FROM Southeast Asia Aid Policy Committee The Committee is. submitting for approval by higher authority, the attached draft joint memorandum to the National Security Council on Indochina. This draft joint memorandum contains a statement of U.S. policy with respect to Indochina. It is the Committees view that the U.S. Government should decide, in principle, to contribute, . in whatever ways are feasible and desirable,to the formation of national armies in Indochina. Such a contribution appears to the Committee as the most effective method by which the U.S. can, at present, strengthen the security of Indochina and add to its stabilization. The Committee would like to point out that the extent and character of the contribution which the U.S. might consider furnishing for the formation of national armies in Indochina can only be determined by negotiations between officials of the French and U.S. Governments, on a ministerial level. During the course of those negotiations French officials may be expected to present, for the first time, detailed information on their plans for the formation of these armies. Approval of the draft joint memorandum would provide the authorization from the President for U.S. representatives to consider and act with full knowledge of the plans of the FrenchIt is recommended that, if negotiations are conducted with representatives of the French Government, U.S. representatives secure French acceptance of the following conditions which shall attach to the extension of U.S. assistance in the formation of national armies in Indochina (1) French Union forces would not be withdrawn from Indochina until such Associated States armies were fully trained and ready to act effectively in replacement; (2) France would not decrease its outlays for Indochina below the 1950 rate during the period of the American military aid requested; (3) the national armies projects would have the approval of the three Associated States governments; (4) the High Commissioner for Indochina, the French Command, and the three Associated States would maintain full consultative relations with the Legation and MAAG during the period of the formation of the armies. If approved, this joint memorandum would provide the measures called for by NSC 64"Position of the U.S. with Respect to Indochina", approved by the President on 23 April 1950. It is understood that the draft of this joint memo will be reviewed by the JCS before it is finally approved by the Secretary of Defense. COPY 330      DRAFT STATEMENT OF U. S. POLICY ON INDOCHINA FOR USG CONSIDERATION (Reference NSC 64, NSC 734) 1. Firm non-Communist control of Indochina is of critical, strategic importance to U. S. national interests. The loss of Indochina to Communist forces would undoubtedly lead to the loss of Southeast Asia as stated in NSC 64. In this respect, the National Security Council accepts the strategic assessment of Southeast Asia which the Joint Chiefs of Staff made on 10 April 1950 (Annex No. 1.). 2. Regardless of current U. S. commitments for provision of certain military assistance to Indochina, the U. S. will not commit any of its armed forces to the defense of Indochina against overt, foreign aggression, under present circumstances. In case of overt aggression, the Department of Defense will immediately re-assess the situation, in the light of the then existing circumstances. 3. To strengthen the security of Indochina against external aggression and augmented internal Communist offensives, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are authorized to conduct military talks with U. K. and French military commanders in the Far East. Such talks would seek, first, an agreed military plan for the internal defense of Indochina and, second, the coordination of operations in Southeast Asia in the eve it of invasion. Such talks should clearly indicate to French authorities that increases in U.S. military aid will be provided .     provided in accordance with operational plans which are acceptable to the U. S. and are compatible with U. S. capabilities in the light of other U. S. commitments. 4. The JJ. S. should secure plans from the French and the Associated States for, and assist the French and the Associated States in the prompt acceleration of the formation of new national armies of the three Associated States (Annex No. 3 contains descriptive information on the magnitude of such plans). The employment of such armies would be for the purpose of maintaining internal security with a view to releasing the bulk of the French forces in Indochina for other duties, in accordance with the strategic plan for the defense of Indochina. In due course, as these national armies are able to assume responsibility for the functions of national defense, the U. S. will favor the phased withdrawal from Indochina of French forces in order to strengthen the defense of Metropolitan France under the NATO arrangements. U. S. and French support for the formation of national armies in Indochina should be given wide and vigorous publicity. Since it is a policy of the United States (NSC 482) to use its influence in Asia toward resolv-ing the colonial-nationalist conflict in such a way as to satisfy the fundamental demands of the Nationalist movement, while at the same time minimi zing the strain on the colonial powers who are. our western allies, the U. S. should, for the time being, continue to press the French to carry out, in letter and spirit, the agreements of March 8, 1949 and the conventions of December 30, 1949 providing for self-government within the French Union. 5. Since ' 352 .     5. since the security of the Associated States of Indochina will be affected, to seme extent, by the capabilities of neighboring or nearby countries to resist Communist encroachments, the U.S. should use its influence, wherever appropriate, to promote close relations and firm understandings, in political, military and economic fields, among the Associated States and Thailand, Burma and the Philippines. In particular, the U.S. should seek to envelope full diplomatic relations between the Associated states and other countries in Southeast Asia, collaboration among military staff officers of these countries on the security of neighboring or adjacent frontiers, and effective agreements on the control of arms smuggling and the movement of subversive agents. The UCS. continues to favor the entry of the three Associated states into the United Nations. As a culmination of these efforts the U.S. should encourage the Associated States, in due course, to participate in such arrangements for regional security under Article 51 and 52 of the United Nations Charter, as will effectively contribute to the common defense of the area. 6. The U.S. will have to devolte substantial resources if the policies stated above are to be carried out effectively enough to assist in strengthening the security of Indochina. It is impossible at this time to set the exact cost in dollars to the United States of the formation of the national armies. When the details of the U.S. contribution have been determined, after discussions with representatives of France COPY . '      of France and the Associated States, The U.S. plan for assisting in the formation of the National Armies of Indochina will be submitted to the National Security Council for approval. e I      ANNEX NO, 1 ' STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA 1,. On 10 April 1950, the Joint Chiefs of Staff made the following strategic assessment of Southeast Asia, including Indochina "4. The mainland states of Southeast Asia also are at present of critical strategic importance to the United States because a. They are the major sources of certain strategic materials required for the completion of United States stock pile projects; b. The area is a crossroad of communications; c. Southeast Asia is a vital segment in the line of containment of communism stretching from Japan southward and around to the Indian Peninsula. The security of the three major non-Comunist base areas in this quarter of the trorldJapan, India, and Australiadepends in a large measure on the denial of Southeast Asia to the Communists. If Southeast Asia is lost, these three base areas will tend to be isolated from one another; d. The fall of Indochina would undoubtabIy lead to the fall of the other mainland states of Southeast Asia. Their fall would (1) Requrie changing the Philippines and Indonesia from supporting positions in the Asian offshore island chain to front-line bases for the COPY defense 365      defense of the Western Hemisphere. It would also call, for a review of the strategic deployment of United States forces in the Far East; and (2) Bring about almost immediately a dangerous condition with respect to the internal security of the Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia, and would contribute to their probable eventual fall to the Communists; . e. The fall of Southeast Asia would result in the virtually complete denial to the United States of the Pacific litteral of Asia. Southeast Asian mainland areas are important in the conduct of operations to contain Communist expansion; f. Communist control of this area would alleviate considerably the food problem of China and would make available to the USSR important strategic materials. In this connection, Soviet control of all the major components ' 1 of Asias tzar potential might become a decisive factor affecting the balance of power between the United States and the USSR. A Soviet position of dominance over. Asia, Western Europe, or both, would consistute a major threat to United States security; and g. A Soviet position of dominance over the Far East could also threaten the United States position in Japan since      since that country could thereby be denied its Asian markets, sources of food and other raw materials. The feasibility of retention by the United States of its Asian offshore island bases could thus be jeopardized." .     ANNEX NO, 2 MILITARY SITUATION IN INDOCHINA 1. View of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In a memorandum of 7 September to the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated tho following "Prior to 1 January 1951, the currently planned level of United States military aid to the French and native allied forces of Indochina should increase their military capabilities but not to the extent of counterbalancing Viet Minh capabilities. In view of these considerations, the Joint Chiefs-of Staff suggest that the proposed United States position take cognizance that the situation in Indochina is to be viewed with alarm and that urgent and drastic action is required by the French if they are to avoid military defeat in Indochina. Such a setback would not only be detrimental to the prestige of the French and the United States but it could also jeopardise the United States military position in Asia." 2. Conclusions of Joint MDAP Survey Mission, After observing conditions in north and south Indochina, General Erskine, Chief of the Military Group of the Joint MDAP Survey Mission in Southeast Asia, reported the following conclusions on 5 August 1950 "(a) Military assistance will have to be provided to the French in Indo-China on a considerable scale if the broad objective of assisting in resisting the encroachment of Communism in Southeast Asia is to be successfully achieved. The assistance which has been requested, up to this time, is considered inadequate to fully consummate the U.S. broad objective. Additional material and equipment trill require additional personnel. "(b) The French forces in Indo-China, after approximately five years of warefare, are ttalemated. Casualties in this type of warfare have been very high. "(c) The French Command and troops, after a very brief study and observations, appear to have lost a considerable amount of offensive spirit and have been frustrated in their efforts to restore internal, security. COPY      7-Cl pDEyl't il Us Achill "(d) The failure of the French to restore internal security is attributed to the lack of cooperation on the majority of the people in Indo-China and a deep-seated hatred and distrust which exists amont a large part of the population. A large measure of the distrust and noncooperative action on the part of the people has undoubtedly been inspired by Communist propaganda and the desire of the Oriental to push the white man out of Asia. "(e) Military action above can not solve the internal security problem in Indo-China because of the lack of cooperation on the part of the people, the distrust and hatred of the French, and the effect of Communist activities and propaganda. A political solution, which includes concessions on the part of the French, and definite plans for eventual independence of Viet Nam is a necessary complement to military action. "(f) The failure to organize Viet Nam armed forces as a separate entity and employ them as Vietnamese troops, not as French Union troops, has been the source of much dissatisfaction on the part of the people and has created a considerable amount of distrust which has withdrawn the support of many people from French efforts. "(g) The Viet Minh still controls the major portion of IndoChina and, for all practical purposes, have the French forces pinned to their occupied and garrisomed areas to the extent that French movement is impossible through partically all areas without armed escort. "(h) The Viet Minh forces have steadily grown in strength and improved their discipline and combat effectiveness. Much of the succes in these fields can be attributed to assistance and supplies from the Chinese Communists and Communist propaganda. "(i) A serious and dangerous external threat from Communist China exists along the northern frontier. "(j) The French forces disposed throughout Indo-China, with .their present equipment and organization, are not capable of dealing with the Viet Minh within the boarders of IndoChina and resisting a strong Chinese Communist attack from the north. The defenses along the frontier of Tonkin      are weak and inadequate. The absence of artificial obstacles, demolition plans and adequate mibile reserves, adequate aircraft support, and the very small amount of artillary, which is now disposed so that it is impracticable to coordinate and mass fires, appear to be the most outstanding weaknesses in the Tonkin area. Another important deficiency is to lack of sufficient personnel now available. Anti-tank defenses in the Tonkin area are practically non-existent. The Viet Minh activities in this area will probably prevent the free movemtnt of such reserves as are now available there." 3. CIA Estimate of the Prospects for Chinese Communist Action in Indochina During 195'0 (ORE 50-50 , 7 September 1950) ' "Communist China at present possesses the Capability for a successful invasion of Indochina. If Communist China, as a participant in the world Communist movement, were called upon to invade Indochina, it could probably be persuaded to initiate such an operation, Chinese Communist military commitments elsewhere would not necessarily militate against and invasion of Indochina because the Chinese Communists posses the forces necessary for military actionseparately or simultaneouslyagainst Indochina, Korea, Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macao. "Despite this general capability and despite the existence of Chinese Communist military concentrations along the Indochina border, adequate for the task,it is estimated that an open Chinese Communist invasionWhile possible and capable of being launched with little or no preliminary warningis. improbable in 1950 because considerations ( from the standpoint of Ho Chi Minh, the Chinese Communists, and international Communism) favoring such action appear to be outweighed by considerations opposing it. It is highly probable, however, that the Chinese Communists will continue to expand military assistance to the Viet Minh forces (by measures short of open invasion) on a scale sufficient to provide those forces with the capability of achieving significant, but limited, objectives in 1950 and assuming that the French receive no more aid than is presently programmed, of eventually expel 1 i ng the French without the aid of a Chinese Communist invasion." 4. Chinese Communist Military Capabilities (ORE 50-50) "Any invasion of Indochina by the Chinese Communists would probably be undertaken in cooperation with the forces of Ho Chi Minh. , Sizable Chinese Communist military forces are in position to intervene in Indochina. Despite reports of actual and scheduled northward movements of certain Chinese Communist field forces, approximately 100,000 troops remain deployed along the Indochinese border. These units could launch an invasion of Indochina without COPY -sx  V t 4      appreciable forewarning. Although reliable reports do not indicate the presence of armored units on the Indochina border, a division of armored cars, plus a battalion of tanks attached to the Fourth Field Army, are stationed in South China within 700 miles of the frontier. Moreover, approximately 150,000 additional Chinese Communist troops could arrive at the Indochina border within ten days to bolster initial invading forces. Even in the event of a simultaneous assult on Taiwan, these reinforcements would be available and would bring the potential invading force to a total of at least 250,000 troops. In view of the Chinese Communists improving capability for waterlift, it is possible that some Invasion forces might be moved by sea to Viet Minh-hold sections of the Indochina coast. There is no evidence, however, of Chinese Communist preparations for such a move. "Although there have been no indications of any significant build-up of Chinese Communist Air Force strength in Southwest China and although this air force has not yet appeared in combat, ' the estimated 200-250 operational combat types (including fighters and light bombers) in the Chinese Communist Air Force could furnish effective air support to operations in Indochina. There are six airfields in China within 170 miles of the Tonkin border. In addition, construction of new airfields and the restoration of others in Southwest China are reportedly in progress in the Tonkin Kwangsi border area and on Heinan Island." 5. Viet Minh Military Capabilities (ORE 50-50) "The forces of Ho Chi Minh, which have been engaged in resistance activities against the French since September 1945, are capable of expanding their operations. Hos organiaation, commonly known as the Viet Minh, possesses approximately 92,500 regular troops and an estimated 130,000 irregulars. The Viet Minh forces include 2,000 Khmer Issaraka in Cambodia and 500 Issaraks in Laos. "The Viet Minh forces are geared primarily for guarrilla warfare. The demonstrated effectiveness of a few task forces, each totaling as many as three to five thousand men and equiped with adequate infantry weapons and some artillary, points to a developing capability for more conventional warfare. Under present circumstances, the Viet Minh should have little difficulty in maintaining relative freedom of action throughout most of indochina while simultaneously supporting pockets of resistance trithin French-occupied territory and continuing to harass French lines of communication. In addition, the Viet Minh is capable of seising one or more French border outposts and holding them for a short time at least. COPY .     "Following the de jure recognition of the Dcmocratic Republic of Vietnam by Communist China and the USSR, a general plan for closer collaboration between the Chinese Communists and the Viet Minh probably was formulated. As many as 10 to 20 thousand Viet Minh troops are being trained in Communist China. There is evi- dence that the Chinese Communists have supplied the Viet Minh with significant quantities of material, probably confined to small arms, ammunition, mortars, and light artillery. Access to training facilities in Communist China, the expansion of routes and facilities for supply, and the possibility of accelerating recruitment give the Viet Minh the potential capabilities for initiating a large-scale offensive against the French at an early date." 6. Capabilities of French-Controlled Forces (ORE 50-50) "French ground, naval and air forces in Indochina are under the operational control of GEQ, Armed Forces in the Far East (FAEO). As of 1 July 1950 French regular ground forces totalled approximately 150,500 men.- An estimated 66,700 troops in the armies of the Associated States, although subject to the nominal political control of these states, are under FAEO operational control In addition there are 122,500 quasi-military and miscellaneous indigenous troops under over-all FAEO control. Of these local forces, only the Vietnamese army, at present weak and ineffective, has the potential for developing into a significant force. French ground forces are capable of penetrating the Viet-Minh held areas of Indochina but at the expense of garrison strength engaged in pacification duties elsewhere. The French have demonstrated a lack of aggressiveness. The French-controlled ground forces have a dual problemthe elimination of the Viet Minh forces and the defense of the China border. Indications are that current emphasis is on the former. Under these circumstances, the most they can hope to achieve in the immeidate future is the destruction of enemy supply caches and the consequent postponment of a large-scale Viet Minh offensive. "The strength of the French Air Force in Indochina, which is severe strained by its actions against Viet Minh forces, presently totals 84 fighters and fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, 68 transports and 50 liaison planes. The level of serviceability of fighter aircraft, now about 55 percent, trill probably continue to drop as maintenance shortages become more acute. Many of the French air installationsfew in number end generally in poor conditionare vulnerable to sabotage and some even to direct Viet Minh attack. COPY      "French naval forces are adequate for supporting the army in small-scale amphibious operations and for conducting raids against the rebel-held sections of the Indochina coast. Their inability to maintain a complete blockade of the coast is demonstarted by the extent of over-water arms smuggling now in progress. French Naval. Forces, Far East, stationed in Indochina, consist of 166 small craft and ships and 21 aircraft manned by 8,750 personnel. Vessels in the most important categories currently stationed in Indochina waters include one old cruiser, 11 fleet minesweepers, two LSTs, nine submarine chasers of various types and a number of supporting service and repair craft. Naval aircraft include nine patrol bombers and 12 reconnaissance aircraft." 0 P Y 3G3 .     ANNEX NO. 3 INFORMATION ON THE FORMATION OF NATIONAL ARMIES OF THE ASSOCIATED STATES 1. General Considerations. The organization and utilization of manpower in the non-Communist countries of Asia is possibly the key to the successful development of the security of Indochina and of Asia. In several years of warfare, the French have discovered that the Vietnamese fighting for Ho Chi Minh provided tough and persistent forces. The military campaign in Korea has demonstrated that Koreans can handle modern weapons and conduct sustained offensive and defensive operations. It may be presumed that Communist China, under the tutelage of often reported Soviet assistance, in developing integrated armies along modern lines. In addition, it would appear that Communist China has, for some time, actively benefited the North Korean armies and now is training and equipping the Viet Minh for operations in Indochina. The basic problem for the western powers is to find ways and means to utilize the manpower resources of Asia in order that the military forces of the west are not committed to actions in areas of limited or less strategic importance. 2. The French Position. On 17 August 1950, U.S. Ambassador Bruce, in Paris, reported to the Department of State that Premier Pleven, in discussing with him the situation in Indochina, had stated that (a) the V . only possible solution was to build up a strong and sufficient native army to make possible the gradual withdrawal of the French army for use      in Europe, (b) this was the only program that would convince the people of the three Associated States of Indochina "of the honesty of French intentions to give them full independence within the French Union," and (c) the French Government would welcome the replacement of French troops by indigenous forces and would aid in every way possible short of assuming an added financial burden which would directly impair its ability to increase its forces in western Europe. Premier Pleven further stated that it was impossible for the French Government to implement this program due to the lack of funds. On 22 September, the French Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense informed the Secretaries of State and Defense of "the need to create immediately powerful national Indochinese armies due to neces sity of repatriating as many French forces as possible, since 20 per cent of French regular officers and 40 percent of French noncoms were frozen in Indochina." Schuman and Moch stated that there were 72,000 men in local armies but "the desired substantial increase in this number would present budgetary problems which neither France nor the Associated States could presently meet." Although the French have stated their objective, they have not, as yet, provided the U.S. Government with any firm figures on the size or the costs of the proposed National Armies. The French High Commissioner in Saigon has frequently used the figure of a regular Vietnamese forces of 120,000 men to be organized by July 1951      3. Views of the U.S. Minister in Saigon. On 19 September, Minister Heath, in Saigon, reported as follows "There is little doubt in our minds here that it we are to find a fairly rapid cure for this civil war which invites further Chinese intervention, native forces in the field must be greatly increased. This will, of course, involve more equipment and cash. Legation cannot state, of course, whether or how much it would be possible for French Government to increase its cash outlay in Indochina at this time. French finances might be able to afford some increase in their Indochina budgets. If they cannot, however, meet full bill for maintenance of increased national army and urgently needed pacification troops, then we shall be obliged to contribute some direct financial aid if we want this dangerously festering situation cleared up. I trust that French delegate now in washington can provide prompt estimates as to French and Associated States financial possibilities in this regard. "Politically, I strongly hold opinion that purpose of national army concept will be dissipated unless Vietnam (and Cambodia and Laos as well) are brought into discussions, their wishes consulted and their desires met to the extent that military efficiency will permit. In this connection President Huus most recent press conference, in which he declared that only Viet forces could obtain necessary rallyings and pacification brought him close to position advocated by nationalists of Nguyen Phen Long-Lam Viet stripe. Key figure in such consultations will, of course, be Bao Dai and I cannot emphasize too insistently my belief that the U.S. should make no definite large-scale commitments .     for the support of the national army project without consultation with Bao Dai and determination exactly where he stands and what role he proposes to assume vis-a-vis the Viet national army. "Finally, but with equal importance, I would strongly urge that definition of U.S. participation in policy and strategic decisions affecting the use of national armies and of American assistance furnished to them accompany any underwriting of the sort French have requested. This participation would involve continuing consultative relationships with French commanding general, with French military missions to the Associated States and with the high military committee and cannot be worked out, in its initial phases, away frcm Indochina." 4. Summary of Non-Communist Indigenous Forces in Indochina. According to the military agreements concluded between France and the Governments of the three Associated States, in 1949, the French High Command retains operational control over all military and security forces in Indochina as long as an emergency exists. The total number of non-Communist forces in Indochina, French and indigenous, amounts to 340,000 troops. French ground forces number about 150,000. These include 44,000 indigenous regulars. The remainder of the total forces, amounting to some 190,000, are divided approximately as follows Vietnamese Regulars Vietnamese Auxiliaries Royal Khmer Army (Cambodia) Laotian National Army Forces of the Racial Minorities Semimilitary Forces FTEO Auxiliaries Total non-Communist Native Forces 28,200 29,000 6,900 2,600 4,500 78,000 40,000 189,200 3d r .      The Vietnamese Regulars and Auxiliaries, the Royal Khmer Army, and the Laotian National Army constitute some 66,000 troops armed and trained to restore and maintain internal security. The other categories in the above list are essentially local police or militia. The 66,000 troops presumably would form the nucleus for the expanded national armies. COPY  368 Declassified per Executive Ordcr 13526    OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WASHINGTON 25, D. C. 13 October 1950 MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL MALONY I have been reading over the draft statement of US policy on Indochina, in the light of the message which the French Premier sent Defense Minister Moch, who gave it to Secretary Marshall. This message, along with other French expressions, highlights the crux of the Indochina problemthe French are trying too little, too late, and not very hard. They have shown no vigorous leadership nor enlightened capacity. This observation leads to a number of implacable principles regarding U.S. policy on Indochina. we must avoid, at all costs; the commitment of U.S. armed forces, even in a token or small scale fashion, for combat operations. Such a commitment would lead the French to shake off responsibilities and show even less initiative in Indochina. There are too many undone things to even consider such a commitment at this stage. And, even as a last resort, there would be serious objections to such a commitment from the U.S. point of view. U.S. officials must be on guard against French attempts to pressure or panic us into some sort of a commitment. Failing to get a satisfactory statement from the U.S., the French,over the next few months, may try a little psychological tzarfare on usThey may speak hopelessly of a coming Dunkirk. They may intimate the necessity tn come to an understanding with the Chinese Communists. They may threaten to throw the problem into the United Nations, either in a political or a military tray. The best defense against such tactics will be to make the French pull themselves up by their own efforts. All the current phases of the Indochina problem seem to lead to the conclusion that the proposed military staff talks trill provide the most effective leverage for reversing the present defeatist management of the military aspect of Indochina. Our talks with the military representatives in CC Mr. Dickinson, Jt Secretaries COPY 369 .     washington were unproductive since it was impossible to discuss the actual situation in Indochina. The French Government in Paris has not yet been stunned into forthright and vigorous action. It is my impression that the U.S. Government has not yet spoken frankly and buntly to the French regarding Indochina. Consequently, the staff talks should provide such an opportunity. The draft statement of U.S. policy in Indochina is weak from the political side. In the drafting stage the Defense representatives argued for a strong, hard-hitting policy on political and economic concessions. The State Department representatives flatly refused and continued to refuse to consider Indochina in that manner. Consequently, the paper ended with a compromise. However, consideration should be given to making any large scale military, political and economical aid program conditionalthe French talking vigorous political measures and reforms in Indochina. As it now stands, military aid will be given when its use appears acceptable to U.S. military authorities, from the military point of view. The conditional factor should be introduced with the french on a ministerial level so that the French Government knows of the American position in this matter. With respect to political measures and reforms, the Department of Defense is beyond this jurisdiction. However, we should have sepcific measures in mind since the State Department representatives reiterated their question "What more can be done in a political way in Indochian?" Finally, we must resolve the problem of influencing the French to take a number of steps in Indochina, on the one hand, without our assuming the responsibility for the success or failure of the overall program to strengthen Indochinas security. K. T. Young COPY     DEPARTMENT OF STATE FOR THE PRESS OCTOBER 17, 1950 No. 1066 In the course of conVersations Which haye taken place during-the last few days between Messrs. Dean C-. Acheson, Secretary of State John W. Snyder, Secretary of the Troasury; George C. Marshall, Secretary of Defense; and William C. Foster, Economic Cooperation Administration, on behalf of the United States, and Messrs. Jules Moch, Minister of Defense; and Maurice Petsche, Minister of Finance, on behalf of France, a review- has been made of the United States contribution to the implementation of the French Rearmament Program within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This reviev has included the question of additional United States military aid to Indochina. The United States Government has expressed the view that a military effort of the general magnitude and character planned by the French Government Would be a Vital contribution to the defensive strength of the North Atlantic area. Out of the sums appropriated by the United -States Congress under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act for fiscal years 1950 and 1951, about $5 billions have been earmarked for military equipment to be delivered to the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-zatlon. France has been assigned by far the largest single part of these amounts.  In addition, tho United States Congress has appropriated for military assistance in the Fr East approximately one-half billion dollars. In Viov of the importance of the operations in Tndochina, the major part of this sura is being uned to provide military equipment, including, light bombers, for the armed forces both of France and of the Associated States of Indochina. This assistance will proVide a very important part of the equipment required by the forces contemplated for activation in 1951 in France and for current operations in Indochina. DeliVeries of equipment are being expedited and, vs.Th respect to'Indochina, a particularly high priority has been assigned.

Meeting was held to recapitulate the talks with the French, to analyze Saigon's views on the Indochina situation, and to review the proposed NSC policy statement on Indochina. 2. Talks With tbs French 'Ministers and Staff. According to available information, the principal results of talks with the French on their military budget were as follows, with respect to Indochina (a) Total budget for Indochina203 billion francs, or approximately 6600,000,COO. This is an increase of 60 billion francs over the 1950 budget. This increase is not directly related to thc formation of the National Armies. It includes a deficit of 35 billion francs carried over from 1950, which was due, in part, to payment for native troops. It was difficult to get adequate explanation from the French of this increase. U.S. representatives stated that the budgetary assistance to make up the overall military deficit has no relation to the formation of the National Armies. In other words, the French could not take .     a portion of whatever budget my assistance is hereafter provided the French and apply it to equipping the National Arity contingents.  (b) Major difference over 1950 is addition of about  20,000 indigenous troops. Increase in total troop strength is from 331,516 to 351,250. These figures were presented before the recent troop loss in Tonkin. Thc 20,000 increase is made up largely of the net addition of 18 battalions to the Vietnam Army. Equipment for this increase is over and above requests made to the Melby-Erskine Mission. Equipment for those 18 battalions is not included in the 1951 budget. It has not been programmed by the French. Apparently, the French do not give the formation of these battalions a very high priority. U.S. representatives emphasized to the French that equipment for the National Armies must come from the equipment requested of the MelbyErskine Mission. The U.S. representatives also emphasized that, with respect to U.S. military assistance, the first concern was to equip French Union Forces to meet the immediate threat, but that the French could readjust the distribution of this equipment in such a way as to provide sons materiel for the National .Army contingents. (c) French Ministers fully agree on formation of National Armies. They asked U.S. finance pay and maintenance, which U.S. representatives did not accept. (d) The French accepted the U.S. suggestion that thc distribution of U.S. equipment between French Union Forces and the National Army contingents shall be determined, in collaboration with U.S. authorities in Saigon, i.e., General Brink. The State Department has includcd this point in a draft aide-memoire to the French Government to eliminate any possibility of misunderstanding. (e) The French Ministers stated that no reduction in the Indochina budget was possible, that France is giving highest priority to equipment for Indochina, and that no evacuation of Tonkin is contemplated at the present time, but that any eventual evacuation will be taken only after consultation with the U.S. and the U.K. (f) Defense Minister Uoch asked for a squadron of B-26's which French authorities had reouested of the Melby-Erskine  fo Mission. Secretary Marshall informed Moch that 20 5-25's and 5 spares would be made available out of the U.S. pipeline to Korea. Delivery date is anticipated as early December, with some of the planes arriving in Indochina in November. The question of whether or not the French have the personnel and maintenance facilities for these planes was not raised with the French representatives-      fO? SWKET (g) It is understood that the French are planning to send reinforcements urgently from France and North Africa to replace the losses incurred in the evacuation of Caobang. These reinforcements may include the 10,000 non-commissioned and enlisted personnel planned for normal replacement in' Indochina. In addition, there is a report that General Carpentier has requested 15 battalions for immediate reinforcement. 3. Saigon's Analysis of Situation (CMN 187c),. Recommendations in para c add nothing that is not already in process in Washington, other than calling in the U.N. to put out the big fire. Mr. Lacy opposes referring the Indochina problem to the U.N. He read his memorandum of conversation (attached) with Counselor of the French Embassy on Saturday, October 14. He and Mr. Hoey briefly-noted the State Department's proposed reply to Saigons cable. 4. Estimate of the Situation. Todays State-Defense informal meeting developed the following opinions on the overall situation, based on current information Political (a) There is no evidence of a French intention to withdraw from Indochina. There is considerable evidence of a French intention to withdraw from Tonkin or a part thereof (b) There is strong evidence of a French intention to throw the Indochina problem into the U.N, (see attached memorandum of conversation on 14 October.) (c) There is no new evidence 'of a French intention to make a deal with the Chinese Communists. It should be noted that French reports fro- Saigon, particularly from High Commissioner Pignon, have begun to emphasise the presence, of large numbers of 11 Chinese troops" on the Vietnamese side of the frontier. Military; . (a) It is expected that the French will evacuate the posts of Laokay and Longson, and the entire border area to the small post of Monkey on the coast.. Since this post can be supplied by sea it is possible that the French may try to hold it. (b) According to the most recent estimate of C3, the French can hold, the Delta area because of their superior fire power and air cover    5. Draft Statement of NSC Policy. It was pointed out that this policy statement is nor before the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Secretaries within the Department of Defense. The meeting today specifically did not consider the question of a connitment of U.S.' armed forces since that question is beyond its authority and since tho draft statement contains a policy statement on.this question. It was tho consensus of the meeting that the draft policy statement is quite adequate, cven in the light of the deteriorating military situation which had been anticipated in the formulation of this draft statement. The meeting felt that the nub of the Indochina problem is this"Can the French stabilise the military situation long enough to increase their troop strength sufficiently to match and overcome thc rapidly growing manpower superiority of the Viet Minh?" Accordingly, the increase in available manpower is the primary need in Indochina. The draft statement of NSC policy addresses itself mainly to this problem. It was ?r. Lacys opinion that this policy statement should be processed just as rapidly as possible. 6. General Malony emphasized the greatly increased importance of the forthcoming military staff talks with thc French in the Far East; they may generate an invigorated determination to take the necessary measures to hold, Indochina within the free world. Thc meeting felt that these talks should concentrate bn Indochina and be held as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is necessary to obtain NSC consideration of Indochina shortly. K. T. Young Attachments2 316       DRAFT AIDE-MEMOIRE , It is the understanding of the United States Government that the conversations between the French Ministers of Defense and Finance and the United States Secretaries of State and Defense produce the following results 1, The Secretary of Defense informed the French Delegation the United States would dispatch to Indochina one squadron of B-26 bombers, these aircraft to be diverted from the American supply pipeline to the Korean Theater. The French Delegation was informed that these planes would, be completely equipped for combat but that no American personnel would be involved in their operation after delivery had been accomplished. The French Delegation was advised that it would be impossible for logistic reasons to deliver these planes before December 1. 2. The Secretary of State advised the French Delegation that, without reference to the French request for budgetary assistance to Indochina in the amount of 60 billion francs, the United States Government would undertake to supply all those items identified in the French request for assistance of March 1950 as confirmed and supplemented by the Melby-Erskine report of August 1950. The French Delegation was further informed that, since it was apparent that the French request for 60 billion francs for budgetary assistance in Indochina bore no important relation to the project of forming large national armies in Indochina, the United States would expect the C 0 . P Y t 377      French authorities to accomplish the equipment of the Indochinese national armies (described, by the French Delegation to the American Delegation in preliminary conversations) out of the equipment to be J supplied by the United States, The French Delegation pointed out that equipment for French Union Forces now engaged in combat took precedence ovcr equipment for national armies, the Secretary of State observed that the United States Government considered the formation of national armies a prerequisite to the final military and political solution of tho Indochinese problem and, therefore, the United States Government must emphasize-ite desire that the French authorities accomplish the formation and training of the national armies describcd by them and the equipment of those armies from the military assistance program based on French requests of March as confirmed and supplemented by the Melby-Erskine report. 3. The French Delegation was advised that the United States had assigned to the initial military assistance program to Indochina the highest priority; that delivery of equipment under this program, totalling about $31 million, would be accomplished for the most part by the end of the year. The French Delegation was further assured by the Secretary of Defense and by the Secretary of State that the United States Government would assign the highest priority to the delivery of military assistance identified in the French request of March 1950 as confirmed and supplemented by the MelbyErskine Report. The French Delegation stated that of its request of March 1950 the first three categories (a), (b), and (c) will have beer, supplied by the end ofthe year; that their next priority requirements were expressed in categories C 0 L 378 .     (d), (e) and (f) in that order (the references are to the French request of March 1950). 4. It was agreed that the technical representatives of the-French Delegation would meet immediately with the technical representatives of the Secretary of Defense to review present priority assignments to items embodied in the French program to the end that deliveries under that program conform to the realities of the military and political situation in Indochina as well as to the serious supply limitations under which the .  United States Government is now operating. ( 5. United States Government expressed the view, and the French Delegation appeared to agree, that the allocation of American military assistance as between armies of the French Union and national army contingents should be approved by French and American authorities in Indochina.

Memorandum of Conversation DATE October 16, 1950 SUBJECT Desirability of French Government Bringing Indochina I Situation to the United NationsPARTICIPANTS Mr. Pierre MilletCounselor, French Embassy Mr. LacyPSA COPIES TO FE American Embassy Paris FUR American Legation Saigon UNAMr. Hickerson 0 Mr. Matthews SAAmbassador Jessup Mr. Millet asked to see ne during the afternoon of October 14. During the course of conversation on the military situation in Indochina (see Memorandum of Conversation entitled nMilitary Situation in Indochina", October 14) Mr. Millet said, that his Ambassador had asked him to secure my entirely personal and unofficial views on the attitude of the Department toward the desirability of the French Government bringing the Indochina situation, in some unspecified manner, to the United Nations. He seemed to imply by several elliptical statements that either General MacArthur or the Department might consider that the . success of the United Nations operation in Korea argued for a reproduction of the same operation in IndochinaI replied that any views I night express were entirely my own and that, as he knevz, this subject could be more profitably discussed vdth Mr; Hickerson. The rest of ny remarks were designed to convey to Mr. Fillet the idea that; (1) the decision as to whether to take the Indochina Situation to the United Nations lay with the French Government and not with the United States. (2) I did not think that the Department had developed, during the last few weeks as Mr, Millet implied, a sentiment in favor cf the French submission of the Indochina situation to the United Nations; that so far as I knew the Department continued to adhere to the position'in respect of this problem agreed on between the United States, French and British delegations during the course of their discussions preliminary to the Foreign Ministers Conferences in New York. (3) United Nations activity in Indochina seemed to me SECRET '380 .     pt to require either a border observation team or mediation . between two parties at interest. I observed I thought that the border team, whose function would presumably be to observe indirect Chinese aggression, would necessarily include Asiatic membership and that as he well knew, the attitude of certain Asian countries toward Chinese Communism and toward Ho Chi Mini', differed from thc views held by the Western Powers; that I presumed the French Government did not look with favor on the treatment of Ho Chi Minh as a party of interest in any case. I had the impression from Mr. Millet that in its desperation ths French Government was for the first time seriously considering United Nations action in Indochina. I did not think it wise therefore, to give Millet even in personal conversation anything that he could describe as a Departmental position beyond that already discussed in the preliminary conversations with the British and French Delegations in September.  Mr. Merchant aid Mr. Godley were given the sense of the foregoing on October 14.

The US GOVT is at present moment taking steps to increase the AMT of aid to FR Union and ASSOC States in their effort to defend the territorial integrity of IC and prevent the incorporation of the ASSOC States within the COMMIE-dor-inated bloc of slave states but even the resources of US are strained by our present UN commitments in Korea, the need for aid in the defense of Western Europe and our own rearmament program. Ue sometimes find it impossible to furnish aid as we ULD wish in a given AMT at a given time and in a given place    SECRET Leadership of Vietnam GOVT during this crucial period is a factor of preponderant importance in deciding ultimate outcome. GOVT must display unusually aggressive leadership and courage be-fore a discouraged people, distraught and floundering in the wake of years of civil war. Lesser considerations concerning the modalities of relations between the States of the FR Union and the REP of ER must, for instance, be at least temporarily laid aside in face of serious threat to very existence of Vietnam as autonomous state, within FR Union or otherwise. We are aware (as is Bao Dai) that present Vietnamese GOVT is so linked with person of Chief of State that leadership and example provided by latter takes on extraordinary importance in determining degree of efficiency in functioning of GOVT. Through circumstances of absence in FR of Bao Dai and other Vietnamese leaders for prolonged period, opportunity for.progress in assumption of responsibilities from FR and extension authority and influence of GOVT with people was neglected. Many people, 'including great number AMERS, have been unable understand reasons for Emperors GTE prolonged holiday UFIQTE on Riviera and have misinterpreted it as an indication of lack of patriotic attachment to his role of Chief of State.

C. 19 October 1950 MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY FINLETTER SUBJECT Indo-China Item 1. Sr. NSC Staff Agenda, Thursday, 19 October, 230 p.m. The Southeast Asia Policy Committee has prepared the attached, which furnishes background and a proposed policy. This is now under review by the Joint Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Military Aid Vfe have been giving military aid to the French and Vietnamese in Indo-China. The Melby-Erakine Mission have completed a survey as to the needs. We Are preparing to give greater aid, and according to priorities to be furnished by Brigadier General Brink, USA, Chief of MAG, now on the spot in the Tonkin area. As you know, this speed-up has been under discussion with the French authorities this past week. A total of 6 French battalions have either been destroyed or isolated by the Viet Minhs. This leaves 15 Battalions available to the French to oppose about twice that number of Viet Minhs, with some 300 miles of the Chinese border open, tri th an open line of supply from China and with some 10,000 Vietnam troops in training in China. The French are planning to retreat further but to hold the Delta area. They should be able to hold, with the addition of 4 replacement battalions now enroute and the capability of moving some other troops from Cochin China. The arrival of General Juin and the French Minister for Colonies should ensure an adequate appraisal of the situation. POlitical Steps with our eye on the main objective in Western Europe and our policy against colonialism, and for nationalism (except where our worthwhile allies would be undulv weakened) our ends could best be served by bringing about on the part of the French a. Definite announcement by the French of a decision on their part to phase out their political government in Indochina (action on their part similar to ours .in the Philippines) COPY      bBuilding up the prestige and strength of the troops of the Associated States and giving them greater autonomy. c. Giving greater governmental powers to the States, within the framework of the French Union. It is, of course, most important that the French do not quit cold and leave a political vacuum behind them. UpS. Military Intervention The case of the French military in Indo-China is not believed to be hopeless. We are not desirous of being a party to colonialism. We should therefore avoid military intervention, at least for the present. Instead, we should do what we think is to their best interest and ours in the long run; that is, rely mainly on the political stemps noted and give increased military aid, aimed primarily at enabling the Associated States to protect themselves against the encroachment of communism.

We believe eyery possible effort SHLD be made by LEG, EMB Paris and DEPT to get these men in the fight as part of the new NATL army.

It will be particularly reassuring to nations of the free world to know that the independence of the Associated States of Indochina within the framework of the French Union is now assured and that the military and economic resources of the French Republic and of the Associated States of Indochina will be directed with boldness and renewed resolution to the defense of Indochina against communist colonialism.  To the end that the armies of the Associated States of Indochina and the French Union accomplish their mission and in order that the new states in Indochina attain stability and offer their people a better life, the United States is extending to them military and economic assistance. The United States GoVernment hopes that other free nations will make cVery contribution within their power to enable the Associated States and their partners in the French Union to accomplish their mission of freedom. 397 .

If we do not negotiate and do not haVe a settlement, what do we do? We may fight as hard as we can in Korea, keeping going as long as possible, punishing the enemy as much as we can. Our negotiating position would be no worse then. If vze are pushed out later and cannot hold Korea, we are still on the islands. We must refuse to recognize their gains. We could make as much trouble for the Chinese Communists as possible and hold Formosa, retaining what strength vze can.

The Joint U o t--ff consider that, Without popular support of the Indo-7  the French will newer achieve a faVorable long-range 'nv 7 clement of the security preblem Of Indochina.r . e Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the following short-term fcr Indochina  liCO .      SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES a. The United States should take action, as a matter of ; .-ancy, by all naans .practicable short of the actual employ-,1 , t of united States military forces, to deny Indochina to ---unisra. b. As long as. ths present situation exists, the United , '.ites should continue to insure that the primary responsibil- tv for the restoration of peace and security in Indochina ' rests with the French. c. The United States should seek to deVelop its military  . assistance program for Indochina based on an OVer-all military lan prepared by the French, concurred in by the Associated Itates of Indochina, and acceptable to the United States I (1) Both the plan and the program should be deyeloped 1 and implemented as a matter of urgency. It should be clearly understood. how-SVer, that United States acceptance of the plan is limited to the logistical support which the United States may agree to furnish. The aid proVided under; ths program should be furnished to the French in Indochina ' and tO the Associated States, The allocation of United  States military assistance as between the French and the  national, armies of Indochina should be approyed by the ' French and United States authorities in Indochina. (2) Popular support of the Government by the Indochinese peeple is essential to a favorable settlement of the j security problem of Indochina, Therefore, as a condition j to the proVision of those further increases in military as- -sistance to Indochina necessary for the implementation of an agreed OVer-all military plan, the United States GoVem-, menu should obtain assurances from the French GoVernment ; that I (a) A program providing for the eyentual self- i gOVernment of Indochina either within or outside of the" French Union will be deVeloped, made public, and imple- mentation initiated at once in order tc strengthen the national spirit of the Indochinese. in opposition tc j communism, (o) National armies of the Associated States of Indochina will be organized as a matter of urgency, I While it is doubtful that the build-up of these armies  can be accomplished in time tO contribute significantly to the present military situation, the direct political and psychological benefits to be derived from this course would be great and votd thus result in immediate, although indirect, military benefits, i V1 01        (c) Pending the formation and training of Indochinese national armies as effectiVe units, and as an interim emergency measure, France will dispatch suffi- cient additional armed forces to Indochina to insure  that the restoration of peace and internal security in I that country will be accomplished in accordance with i the timetable Of the over-nil military plan for Indochina. (d) France will change its political and military concepts in Indochina to i. Eliminate its policy of "colonialism. ii. ProVide proper tutelage to the Associated , States. j iiie Insure that a suitable military command structure, unhampered by political interference, is established to conduct effective and appropri- , xss ate military operations. The effectiVe implerten- tation of these changes will require competent and efficient political and military leaders Who will be able to cope with the conditions in that ccun-try. (3) At an appropriate time the United States should institute checks to satisfy itself that the ccnditions set forth in subparagraph c-(2) aboVe are being fulfilled.  d. The United States should exert all practicable political' and diplomatic measures required to obtain the recognition of the Associated States by the other non-communist states of Southeast and South Asia. e. In the eVent of OVert attack by organized Chinese Com- 1 aunist forces against Indochina, the United States should not r-Rm.it itself to become engaged in a general war with Communist China but should, in concert with the United Kingdom, suppcrt France and the Associated States by all means short of the actual employment of United States military forces, This suppcrt should include appropriate expansion of the present military resistance program and endeaVors to induce States in the neigh- ! torhood of Indochina to commit armed forces to resist the ag- I tression. t f. The United States should immediately reconsider its pol-' y toward Indochina Whenever it appears that the French GoVern--nt nay abandon its military position in that country or plans ; refer the problem of Indochina to the United Nations. Unless situation throughout the world generally, and Indochina. V1 If 02        snecifically, changes materially, the United States should seek . to dissuade the French from referring the Indochina question tc ' the United Nations.  1 e. Inasmuch as the United States-sponsored resolution, ; "Uniting for Faace", has been adopted by ths General Assembly ' of" the United Nations, and should a situation deVelcp in Indc- ' china in. a manner Similar to that in Korea in which United Na- . tions forces Were required, the United States Would then prob- ably be morally obligated to contribute its armed forces des- ignated for serVice on behalf of the United Nations. It is, thereforey in the interests of the United States to take such i action in Indochina as Would forestall the need for the General Assembly to inVOke the proVisions Of the resolution, "Uniting for Peace".  5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the following long-term .jcctiVes for Indochina I,ONG-TERM OBJECTIVES a. United States security interests demand that this government, by all means short of the actual employment of United States military forces, seek to preVent the further spread of communism in Southeast Asia generally and, in particular, in French Indochina. ' b. The United States should seek to insure the establishment of such conditions in Indochina that no foreign armed ' forces vill be required for the maintenance of internal securityc. The United States should continue tO press the French  . to carry out in letter and in spirit the program referred to in '  . paragraph 4-c-(2)-(a) abOVe, proViding for the eVentual self-  gOVernment of Indochina either Within or outside of the French Union.  d. The United States should continue to favor the entry of  the three Associated States of Indochina into the United Naticns. e. The United States should encourage the-establishment of Rn appropriate form of regional security arrangement embracing Indochina and the other countries of SoLtheast Asia under Art- icles 51 and 52 of the United Nations Charter, . 41 .  03 Declassified per Executive Ordcr 13526    h.  6.

From Chief HAAG singned BrinkReference unn Deptel 28, Oct 1950. French are gradually withdrawing from northern frontier and plan to hold general line Moncay-Laokay in Tonkin; in order protect Hanoi-Haiphong area and coal mining area north of Haiphong. Perimeter of these areas is to be organized as main line of resistance. Pacification measures throughout rest of Indochina will continue . in.effect. Northern portion of new defensive area is mountainous with corridors running generally, but not inyariably so, tovard the Haiphong-Hanoi Delta area. No natural barriers lie between the new line and the Delta area. Haiphong and Hanoi are both surrounded by open Delta paddy country With numerous winding tributaries of the Red RiVer. Railroads lead from Hanoi to Langson and Haiphong. The latter, along With the highvay, are the main supply routes to the operational area. The presence of Viet Minh troops preyents land communications between Saigon and Hanoi re-qulring movements by water and air only. Average time for movements of troops and materiel from Saigon to Haiphong or Hanoi by water and rail varies from 3 to 4 Weeks. Airlift between tho same places is 36 hours. Weather during NoVember, December and January in Tonkin area generally excellent with intermittent thunderstorms; in central coastal area poor with average of 20 days per month heayy rain and lov ceilings, In southern area generally excellettt with intermittent thunderstorms. In the Tonkin Delta area February weather is extremely poor with heavy fog and mist. In central coastal area February weather conditions remain unchanged until June. Weather, therefore, favors .general offensive operations in next 3 months by the Viet Minh which has not yet materialized. Army The Army combat strength equals the combat strength of the Viet Minh. Army superiority in artillery, engineer seryices, NSC 641  1 I    NND 63.316.  I ;  veaoons, transportation signal equipment and leyel of supply. It is inferior to Viet Minh in mobility. The Army needs (A) Minimum 9 additional battalions in North Tonkin area to make a limited offensiye possible. These battalions are not ayailable in Indochina and must come from France or its possessions, ' . (b) Weaponsand equipment to supplement materiel nov in use and to replace unserviceable materiel. Adequate spare parts must bs furnished. > Nayy Navy has complete Naval superiority and can operate freely along ths coast; and inland waterways proVided formations of armored craft are used. Nayymission is (A) To support ground forces in shore operations by proViding shipping convoys for the transportation of personnel and equipment;  . (b) To furnish gunfire support and maintain control of off shore areas to preVent Viet Minh smuggling and possible amphibious assault. The NaVy has moyed additional emphibious craft and commando units to Tonkin I (a) To reinforce the line Haiphong-Moncay, (b) To prevent possible flanking by sea and (c) To conduct operations with ground force along inland waterways. The flexibility and ability to moVe concentrations rapidly as needed, made possible by employment of amphibious units, should prOve a powerful advantage in Delta fighting. At present the line of defense is still too far inland to allow much Naval participa- . tion in active combat. 1 i , Air; Viet Minh air strength reported as 40 aircraft which can be successfully engaged by French Air Reserve. Viet Minh anti aircraft artillery is negligible at this time (a fev 20inm guns have recently made their first appearance). French have a small and highly coordinated efficient air transport organization for routine and emergency supply and troop moVements Which has been operating for 3 years from Hanoi Bay. It is capable of ready expansion. Military Air Transport can be supplemented by commercial airlines. There is a specific need for light bombers, fighter bombers, air transport craft and low level reconnaissance planes for photography. The potential of the French Army, Nayy and Air supported by their greater resources of all kinds is greater than Viet Minh potential. But as present closer coordination of the action of these forces is needed. ' NSC 641 '  . 60S       i . The French state that they now contemplate changing their troop dispositions from a "pacification pattern" of Widely scattered small units in North Tonkin intended to gain the good will of th natiyes and keep dotm local incidents, to an "operational pattern. This Will require a political decision. The present problem in Indochina under current plans is (A) To regroup companies and smaller units nov in Tonkin area into cembat fighting battalions or regiments with cross-country ability in order to maintain a flexible line of resistance, (B) To achie-Ve the proper coordinated action of these forces in local area action, (C) To at least maintain the pacification statue quo throughout remainder of Indochina. I . A withdrawal to the Hanoi-Haiphong Delta area Will permit a stronger coordinated defense in which combined French Army, Navy, end Air Forces can bagin dual support and be employed to their utmost capabilities, When their action is properly coordinated. There are excellent fields of fire for Infantry and Artillery. Air will not be forced to operate in restricted mountainous areas and targets Will be better defined and more accessible. Numerous waterways in the Delta area will greatly hamper Viet Minh moVemenks because of the necessity to moV on foot. Viet Minh routes of advance vill be canalized end opportunity for rendezVous made more i difficult. French troops Will haVe greater ground, Water and air 1 transportation facilities which will afford greater opportunity for quick concentration of larger French troops against the Viet i Minh forces. The withdrawal will also permit a regrouping of troops for local offensiye action or a.general offensive. French supply lines Will bs shortened and Viet Minh lines lengthened forc- ing them to establish sub-arsenals and sub-depots south of the frontier where they Will be subject to French air attack and ground . ' penetration. The Withdrawal, however will permit the Viet Minh to  consolicate the area from which these units are withdrawn giVing  them airstrips, better bases in Indochina and permit political  organization and their conscription of the population and nay produce an unfavorable chain reaction among the population of Indo. 1 china. It is possible that relatiyely feu weapons and possibly ' > aircraft will be glyen by the Chinese Communists as token gift to the Viet Minh. Chinese Communists may be loath to spare many of these Weapons because of their commitments in Manchuria, . Changhai-Amoy area, Kovloon, Canton and Tibet. NSC 641 07  .      It must be assumed that, in general, French are fighting in unfriendly territory in all their military efforts in Vietnam. Their military operations mAy bo jeopardized by transfer of loyalty to the Viet' Minh throughout Vietnam unless further politically effective concessions aro made by France to Vietnam and the for-nation of Vietnamese Army is initiated. Weakness of present French military organization appears to be (A) An excessibely static organization of defensive area with no proVisions for mutual support. Detachments from general reseryes are sent to the areas as needed ans pass to control of area commander, (B) There are not yet combat organizations greater than battalion size end this does not provide, adequate striking . forces for strong military effort, . (C) Lack of proper coordination of forces. Few airground liaison teams exist. Conclusions (1) There has been unduly exaggerated military impor-. tance attacked to Cao Bang incident, political effect has been serious, (2) French military forces have been greatly shocked ' by this incident and better reorganization of thelr fighting forces can be expected, (3) Contemplated withdrawal will inVolve series of diffi-. cult operations and further French losses must be expected, f ..1 (4) If adequate military aid arrives within next two months end French forces in Tonkin receive an additional 9 ; battalions and are reorganized and properly trained as the French plan, serious penetrations by Viet Minh of Hanoi- j Haiphong Delta area and coal mines north of Haiphong can be preVented, . ,. (5) Monca.y-Laokay line is oyer-extended and can be easily penetrated by Viet Minh forces, Laokay itself offers little military advantage except as bar to Viet Minh adVance down Red River but can be by-passed or captured by Viet Minh. Possession of Moncay denies Viet Minh port on the gulf. This port and the port immediately south, if held, can be used as bases from which to launch French counter-offensive. 0 641  .      (6) French at present are in no position initiate < counter-offensive to drive Viet Minh to northern border, nor will then be in predictable future in View of increasing Viet Minh strength, unless additional trained troops ar.e brought in from France or its possessions, I (7) Viet Minh activities Cambodia and Laos as Well as Vietnam are increasing and no troops can bs spared from these areas or operations in Tonkin, (8) Formation of Vietnamese Army is still under discussion, and not likely to become consolidated force within a year, and Will not have any appreciable military value before 1952 except possibly as police force in pacification areas. Conclusions are based on assumption that Chinese Communists will not openly participate in Viet Minh operations and immediate military aid requested in Legtel 566, October 16 will arrive by 1 January 1951. t Extremely fast-moving political situation in Indochina presents many complications for French Military Command. Current plans of French military here are at present still dependent on controversial negotiations and political decisions which must be made quickly, and the military is being delayed in implementing their current plans. Three main questions at this time are (A) Decision which must yet be made as to changing the mission of military in Tonkin entirely from pacification to direct operational, i . (B) Manner and speed with which Vietnamese Army will be actiVated, (C) Speed with which military air will be deliyered. Current French plans trill be successful only if these- questions are resolwed successfully without delay.

They are the major sources of certain strategic materials required for the completion of United States stockpile projects; "b. The area is a croSsroad of communications; "c. Southeast Asia is a vital segment in the line Of containment of communism stretching from Japan southward and around to the Indian Peninsula. The security of the ihree maJor non-Communist base areas in this quarter of -the-jiorld.--Japan, India,"and. Australiadepends in a large measure on the denial of Southeast'Asia to the Communists. If Southeast Asia is lost, these three base areas Will tend to be isolated from one another; "d. The fall of Indochina Would undoubtedly lead to the fail of the other mainland states of Southeast Asia. Their fall would v(l) Require changing the Philippines and Indonesia from supporting positions in the Asian offshore island chain to front-line bases for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. It would also call for a reView of the strategic deployment of United States forces in the Far East; and i "(2) Bring abOitt almost immediately a dangerous condition With respect to tha internal security of the Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia, and would contribute to their probable eVentual fall to the ccm-munistsJ "e. The fall of Southeast Asia would result in the virtually complete denial to the United States of the Pacific littoral Of Asia. Southeast Asian mainland areas are important in the conduct of operations to contain . communist expansion; , . 641 j        "f. Communist control of this area Would alleviate considerably the food problem of China and Would make available to the USSR important strategic materials. In this connection, Soviet control of all the major components. of Asiaa War potential might become a decisive fac- tor affecting the balance of power between the United States and the USSR. A SoViet positinn of dominance over . Asia, Western Europe, or both, would constitute a major threat to United .States security; and "g. A Soviet position of dominance OVer the Far East would also threaten the United States position in Japan since that country could thereby be denied its Asian markets, sources of food and other raw materials. The feasibility of retention, by the United States of its . Aslan offshore island bases could thus be jeopardized," 2, The series of defeats suffered recently by the French in northern Tonkin serves to focus attention upon the urgency of the current military situation in Indochina and points up the fact that the Viot Minhs now constitute a direct threat to the French military position in Indochina. Thc current military situation is serious since the effect produced by the impact of French defeats can gain momentum Which may haye dire repercussions upon an already deteriorating political situation in Southeast Asia. By taking OVer border posts, the Viet Minhs now can maintain unin-errupted liaison With Communist China. At this time When a majority of the Indochinese are favorably disposed toward the Viet Minhs, as opposed to the French and Bao Dal, any increases in popular support of the Viet Minhs could have alarming consequences. -The deteriorating military and political situation in French Indochina demands that the United States policy toward Indochina be recast in order to assist in restoring the balance in favor of the French and Vietnamese3. There is an important difference between the strategic importance of Indochina to the United States in a major war and its strategic importance in a cold War. Current vrar plans do not contemplate the deployment of United States military forces for the retention of Indochina in the eVent of global War. However, if the communists gained control of Indochina at any time other than in the course of a global v;ar, this would bring about almost immediately a dangerouS condition With respect to the internal secu-ity of all of the other countries of Southeast Asia, as Well as the Philippines and Indonesia, and would contribute to their probable eyentual fall to communism, EVen India and Pakistan WOuld be threatened. Thus the loss of Indochina to communism would have direct implications on United States security. In addition, this loss would have Widespread political and psychological repercussions upon other non-communist states throughout the world. In view of United States "ecurity interests in the country, and the critical situation novr NSC 641  h!2 .      existing there, the United States should take action, as a matter of urgency, by all means practicable short of the actual employment Of United States military forces, to deny Indochina to communism. 4. It appears that the French are only now beginning to recognize the military and politic?.l measures which must be undertaken in order tO secure the French position in Indochina. The French attitudes and actions, houeVer, must not be permitted to obscure the United States interest in ths solution of the Indochina problem. 5. It has been suggested that if the French remain in Indochina that country might be lost to communism, regardless of the military  aid programs Which the United States may implement. This thinking ; preaupposes either such a low order of military power in France and ; her colonies as to make it utterly impossible for that nation to cope With the Viet Minhs or such intransigence and unrealism in the ! French GoVernment as to preclude it from facing facts. Current . I intelligence estimates do not accord France and her colonies this .. I low order of military power. While, up to this time, the attitude of the French GoVernment toward French Indochina has been one of I temporization and consequently one Of Weakness, it is believed that' the seriousness of the situation, particularly the political situ- i ation, may now have been recognized by the French Government. 6. The United States should urge France to meet its resppnsi-' bility by taking the military, political, and economic action, including ths injection of new leadership, necessary to save Indochina from communism. If France decides to withdraw from French I Indochina, there would, in all probability, be only's slight chance that the United Nations could retrieVe the situation in that country  in faVor of the Western Powers. I 7. The following are the three major courses with military implications Which might be adopted to achieVe peace and security in Indochina against either the internal threat of the Viet Minhs or the external threat of Communist China a. Through armed action by France and the Associated States of Indochina together With the forces of the United States andcr other Vies tern Powers; b. By armed action by France and the Associated States of Indochina supported by United States military aid and assistance; and c. By United Nations action either under ths United States-sponsored resolution, "Uniting for Peace," or by French vith-drawal from Indochina and action by the United Nations similar to that followed in the case of the Netherlands and Indonesia, 8. In the eVent of overt attack by organized Chinese Communist forces against Indochina the United States should not permit itself NSC 641  .      to become engaged in a general war with Communist China and should ot, therefore commit United States forces to that area; neither should the United States commit its military forces to Indochina in order to assist ths French in restoring internal security. The considerations underlying these Views are . a. InvolVement of United States forces against Viet Minh forces would be likely to lead to war with Commnnist China. b. A general War with Communist China would, in all probability, have to be taken as a prelude to global war; c. Our major enemy in a global war would be the USSR; d. Our primary theater in the eVent of a global war Would, in all probability, be Western Europe; and e. The forces of the Western Powers are insufficient to wage war on the mainland of Asia and at the same time accomplish the predetermined Allied objectives in Europe. 9. While minor commitments of United States military forces might be sufficient to defeat ths Viet Minhs in Indochina it is -more probable that such commitments Would lead to a major inVolvement of the United States in that area similar to that in Korea or eVen to global war. Accordingly, there would be great potential langer to the security interests of the United States in the commitment of any "token" or "jainor" United States forces in Indochina . 10. Indochina is an area in Which the French bear primary responsibility, and the problem of restoration of peace and security to that country should continue to rest With the French. OVert intervention by any foreign power on the side of France Would immediately enhance the danger of a global War and vzould lay France and the other foreign powers open to a charge of imperialism. 11. Thus far the French apparently have failed in Indochina to provide adequate political and military leadership, to deVelop sound military plans, and to utilize properly their military resources. The urgency of the situation in Indochina, however, is so ; great that the present United States military aid program fc>r that i country should continue, and steps should be taken to expedite  shipment of the materiel earmarked for that area. However, it Would be desirable for the United States military assistance program to be based on an over-all military plan for Indochina deVeloped j by the French, concurred in by the Associated States of Indochina, and acceptable to the United States. This plan should be deVeloped as a result of staff talks conducted in Saigon among representatives of the three countries. It should be made clear from the outset HSC 641        that United States acceptance of the plan is limited to the logistical support which the United Statos may agree to furnish. If time permits, military representatives of the United Kingdom also might bs invited to attend. There should be a timetable to the plan. Estimates of materiel requirements Which the United States Would be expected to provide on an accelerated basis Should also be submitted. 12. Popular support of the GoVernment by the Indochinese people is essential to a favorable settlement of the security problem of Indochina. Therefore, as a condition to the provision of those further increases in military assistance to Indochina necessary for the implementation of an agreed OVer-all military plan, the United States GoVernment should obtain assurances from the French GoVernment that a. A progretm proViding for the eventuetl self-go Vernine nt of Indochina either within or outside of the French Union will be developed, made public, and implementation initiated at once in order to strengthen the national spirit of the Indochinese in opposition to communism; b. National armies of the Associated States of Indochina will be organized as a matter of urgency. While it is doubtful that the build-up of these armies can be accomplished in time to contribute significantly to the present military situation, the direct political and psychological benefits to be deriVed from this course would be great and Would thus result in immediate, although indirect, military benefits) . c. Pending the formation and training of Indochinese national armies as effectiVe units, and as an interim emergency measure, France will dispatch sufficient additional armed forces to Indochina to insure that the restoraticn of peace and internal security in that country will be accomplished in  accordance With the timetable of the OVer-all military plan for IndOchina; and d. France Will change its political and military concepts in Indochina to . (1) Eliminate its policy of "colonialism"; (2) ProVide proper tutelage to the Asscciated States; and (3) Insure that a suitable military con-mand structure, unhampered by political interference, is established to cOnduct effectiVe and appropriate military operations. The effectiVe implementation of these changes Will require competent and efficient political and military leaders who will be able to cope With the conditions in that country. SC 641  id.5 .      13. At an appropriate time the United States should institute checks to satisfy itself that the conditions set forth in paragraph 1 12 aboVe are being fulfilled. The United States should also con- tinuo to maintain the situation in Indochina und?r continuing review and should be prepared to revise its policy When conditions warrant. 14. In the event of OVert attack by organized Chinese Communist forces against Indochina, the United States should not permit itself to become engaged in a. general War With Cor nmist China but should, in concert With the United Kingdom, support France and the Associated States by all means short of the actual employment of United States military forces. This support should include appropriate expansion of the present military assistance program15. Any appeal by France to the United Nations vzould, in all probability, be embarrassing for the Western Powers since the rule of France over its colony is not likely to be Well receiVed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The USSR has recognized the Viet Minh GoVernment and, therefore, a Veto by the USSR of any assistance for France Would have to be expected in the Security Council. In view of the foregoing, unless the situation throughout the world generally and in Indochina specifically changes materially, the United States should seek to dissuade the French from referring ' the Indochina question to the United Nations. ' 16, Inasmuch as the United States-sponsored resolution, "Uniting fOr Peace, has been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and should a situation develOp in Indochina in a manner similar tc that in Korea in which United Nations forces Were required, the United States Would then probably be morally obligated to contribute its armed forces designated for service on behalf of the United Nations. It is, therefore, in the interests of the United States to take such action in Indochina as vzould forestall the need for the General Assembly to invoke the proVlsions of the resolution, "Uniting for Peace." Should France, howeyer, refer the question of Indochina to the United Nations, the United States should give consideration to adopting a position fayoring early French withdrawal from Indochina and action by the United ! Nations similar to that followed in the case of the Netherlands and ! Indonesia. 1), It appears that, in View of the unrest in Southeast Asia generally and in Indpchina specifically, any military victory in Incochina OVer the communists vzould be temporary in nature. The long-term solution to the unrest in Indochina lies in sweeping . political and economic concessions by France and in the ultimate self-goVernment of the three AssociatedStates within.the French . Union or their complete independence of France. From the viewpoint of the United States, pressure on France to proVide the much needed leadership to initiate these reforms and to grant self-goVernment ill proVe less expensive in United States liVes and national trea-3are than military commitments by us. 430 641.  til 6      SECRET MEMORANDUM FOR MR.

With regard lb lndochina, "the Prime Minister declared that France was determined to do its utmost to continue" its efforts to resist "the Communist onslaught in order to maintain the security and independence of the Associated States, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos."  e. There was agreement that it was desirable to build up the native Indochinese forces as rapidly as possible, but we held out no hope for the provision of US budgetary assistance for the National Army in Indochina, stating that we continue to believe that we cannot become directly inVolVed in local budgetary deficits of other countries. r f. "The President informed the Rrime Minister that United States aid for the French Union forces and for the National Armies of the Associated States will continue, and that the increased quantities of material to be delivered under the program authorized for the current fiscal year will be expedited." Additional measures for US aid to Indochina included 1) an indication of our willingness to relax the original restrictions placed on the use by the French of the US aircraft carrier Langley in the Mediterranean in view of cur inability to provide another US carrier for serwice in Indochina; and 2) an agreement to study the possibility of reallocating funds now available in an effort to provide equipment for four Vietnamese divisions. g. The President said that the United States was agreeable to US, UK, French military consultations on Indochinese matters. h. In the event of a Chinese Communist attack cn Indochina, the US agreed to giVe all possible assistance in the evacuation of French forces if such action becomes necessary. The extent of the aid would be limited by other demands on our forces, such as Korea, which exist at the time any request for assistance is made.

LAY, JR., EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL  SUBJECT First Progress Report on NSC 64, "The Position of the ' United States With Respect to Indochina11. NSC 64, "The Position of the United States with Respect to Indochina, was approVed as government policy on March 27, 1950. It is requested that this first progress report as of March 1, 1951, be circulated to members of the Council for their information. IPOLICY IMPLEMENTATION. Military Aid The Military Aid Program to Indochina enjoys the highest priority immediately after the military effort in Korea. The first deliVeries began in June 1950 and by the end of January 1951 military assistance totalling approximately $50 million had been deliVered .to Indochina. Approximately $113 million in further military aid already has been programmed and is at Varying stages in the supply process. An additional $52 million of military aid is now being programmed out of remaining FY 51 funds and something approaching $1)0 million for this purpose has been included in the tentatiue budget estimates upon which the President's FY '52 budget was based. This aid program follows in general the request submitted to the United States GoVernment by the French GoVernment in March 1950. During August 1950 Indochina was visited by a Joint Survey Mission under the chairmanship of Mr. John Melby of the Department of State, of which Major General Erskine, USMC was the senior -' military member. The mission recommended that the United States continue its efforts to supply the assistance requested by the French in March 1.950, With certain additions. Equipment already deliVered to Indochina, or enroute, includes Various aircraft, naVal Vessels, equipment for twelVe infantry battalions (less ' small arms), and miscellaneous equipment and ammunition, supplied both from the United States and the United States Far East Command. In addition to the military assistance initially requested, materiel has now been requested for 'the equipping of national armies in each of the three States. The cost and aVailability of this materiel is now unknown.       U. S. military aid already received, in Indochina has increased the capability of the State forces and French Union forces considerably. If aid already furnished had not been supplied, those forces would not haVe been able to maintain their present positions. It is realized however, that American assistance is supplemental to, end does not replace the primary responsibility of thp three States and of the French Republic. Indochina Foreign Relations The United States has continued to extend political support to the States of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Agrement has been granted for the first Cambodian Minister to the United States. The United Kingdom has sent a diplomatic representatlve to the three States. Vietnam, is planning to open a mission in Bangkok and has sent a minister to London. Cambodia has named a minister to BangkokThe three State Governments haVe been recognized by some 30 povers. They haVe been elected to membership in seVeral UN organs such as FAO, WHO and IEO. The USSR and its satellites, including Communist China, haVe recognized the Ho Chi Minh moye-ment as constituting the legal government of Vietnam, but not of Cambodia and Laos. Although the GoVernment of Thailand and the Republic of Korea have extended diplomatic recognition to the three GoVernments, the majority of the Asian states continue to be apathetic toward recognition. This attitude is based on an anti-colonial rather than a pro-Communist sentiment. The result, nevertheless, has been indirectly to encourage the Communist-directed Viet . Minh forces through failure to support the legal goVernments. The French GoVernment has done little in the past to publicize the progressive transfer of authority to the three States, which was completed by the end of 1950. In external affairs, the French Government has the right to be consulted on the selection of diplomatic posts, designation of Chiefs of Missions and negotiation of International agreements. The continuing presence in Indochina, howeVer, of a French High Commissioner and some 70,000 French troops, as well as the fact that France continues to finance, to a large degree, the budget deficits of the three State Governments, may constitute in Asian eyes eVidence of continued French control. A withdrawal of French financial and military support would resu.it in rapid successes by the Viet Minh forces and the formation of Communist goVern meats within the three States. Asian states are only slowly becoming aroused to this threat to their o,wn independence as a result both of United States efforts to identify it and of Chinese actlVities in Korea and Tibet, in addition to Indochina.        Indochina Internal Situation . Internal administration was transferred by the French to the State GoVernments on December 30, 1949, except for certain powers reseryed to the French High Commissioner and certain interstate matters to be settled by an interstate conference. This conference was concluded in NoVember 1950 when it was agreed that all internal administration would be turned OVer by the French z to the State GoVernments by December 31, 1950. HoweVer, the piastre would continue to be pegged to the franc (at a rate highly beneficial to the piastre); the French haVe military base rights similar to those of the United States in the Philippines as proVided in the United States-Philippine Treaty; and French functionaries would continue to carry out certain educational, war damage, and French military security functions. Other French functionaries would be employed by the Associated States only as desired by the latter. The three State GoVernments are now limited in their assumption of powers only by the aVailability of qualified indigenous officials their dependence on continued French financial support and their lack of popular support. The planned formation during 1951 of national armies is expected to contribute tovard the actual attainment of soyereignty in each State. This, should haVe a beneficial political effect in winning additional popular support for the gOVernmentsThe most seVere threat to the continued growth and eVen to  the continued existence of the State gOVernments is the Increased capability of the Viet Minh forces, resulting from the extension . of military and materiel aid from Comnunist China. There is also , some evidence of SoViet support. Such aid from Communist China began inApril 1950, and has increased steadily. Up to now, light ' artillery, mortars and automatic Weapons haVe been shipped to Indochina for the Viet Minh. Training centers in South China have trained and equipped some 50 Viet Minh battalions Which haye returned to Vietnam. The capacity of the training centers has been estimated at 10 to 30 thousand men rotated about eVery three months with some 50,000 haying already completed their training. It has been reported that there are 15 to 20 Chinese technicians with each China-trained Viet Minh battalion, usually directing the artlllery. The capability of these troops is rated as equal to that of French Union Forces. Chinese Communist troops in South China, within easy striking distance of the border, are estimated at two to three hundred thousand. Airfields at the border posts eVacuated by the French are available to the Viet Minh, end air training is reportedly being conducted in China. HoweVer, no Viet Minh air potter has yet been used, and in this respect the French 5 Union Forces hold a present adyantage due almost entirely to United States Military Aid. French Nayal power is also superior 423  .      but is Incapable of interdicting all small craft smuggling arms. The Viet Minh forces haVe the present ability to continue to occupy the major area of Tonkin (North Vietnam), and to threaten the two large cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Scattered elements throughout central and southern Indochina, continue to have a harassing ability, preventing peaceful conditions and the resumption of orderly life and trade. With continued assistance at the present leVel from Communist China, the Viet Minh forces will remain a serious threat to the ability of the States and the French Union Forces to defend and hold the major portion of Indochina. If massive Chinese Communist armies actually InVade Indochina, such an attack could not be successfully resisted by the presently available forces and most of Indochina could be OVerrun within a matter of, months. ( The ability of the State and the French Union Forces to maintain their present positions in Indochina, therefore depends only upon the absence of an actual Chinese Communist inwasion in force. Their ability to improve their present position, that is, defense against the Viet Minh as presently augmented by Chinese > Communist aid, Will depend upon continuing materiel and financial( aid from France and the United States, and the skill with which ! such resources are utilized. IIPOLICY EVALUATION The policy adopted in NSC 64 and the measures taken to implement it haVe made a valuable contribution toward the stability of Indochina and of Southeast Asia. American military aid furnished the States' forces and the Army of the French  Union may haVe been the decisiVe factor in the preseryation of the area against Communist aggression. Future policy vith regard to Indochina Will be the subject of new studies now under preparation for the NSC. s JAMES E.

United States objectives, policies, and cOurses of action in Asia should be designed to contribute toward the global objectiVe of strengthening the free world Vis-a-Vis the SoViet orbit, and should be determined with due regard to the relation of United States capabilities and commitments throughout the world. HoweVer, in View of the communist resort to armed force in Asia, United States action in that area must be based on the recognition that the most immediate oVert threats to United States security are currently presented in that area. 2. Current SoViet tactics appear to concentrate on bringing the mainland of Eastern Asia and eVentually Japan and the other principal off-shore islands in the Western Pacific under SoViet control, primarily through SoViet exploitation of the. resources . of communist China. The attainment of this objectiVe on the mainland of Eastern Asia would substantially enhance the global position of the USSR at the expense of the United States, by securing the eastern flank of the USSR and permitting the USSR to concentrate its offensiVe power in other areas, particularlyin Europe. SoViet control of the off-shore islands in the Western Pacific, including Japan, would present an unacceptable , 426 ISO 435 TP SECRET       threat to the security of the United States. ' 3. The United States should, without sacrificing Vital security interests, seek to aVoid precipitating a general war with the USSR, particularly during the current build-up of the military and supporting strength of the United States and its allies to a level of military readiness adequate to support United States foreign policy, to deter further SoViet aggression, and to form the basis for fighting a global war should this proVe unaVoidable. This should not preclude undertaking calculated risks in specific areas in the OVer-all interest of the defense of the United States. , 4-. The United States should seek the firm establishment and effective application of the principle of collectiVe security and should, except in those instances when on balance the need for unilateral action outweighs other considerations, act in and through the United Nations, preserVe solidarity with its principal allies, and maintain the continued coOperation of other friendly nations.  Long-Range Objectives 5. The long-range national security objectiVes of the United States With respect to Asia are , a.

Continue as an ultimate objectiVe to seek by . political, as distinguished from military means, a sdution of , the Korean problem which would proVide for a united, independent  and democratic Korea, Seek, through appropriate UN machinery, as a current objective a settlement acceptable to the United States, of the Korean conflict which would, as a minimum (1) terminate hostilities under apprOpriate armistice arrange- f ments; (2) establish the authority of the Republic of Korea over all Korea south of a northern boundary so located as to ESC 485  .     f  facilitate, to the maximum extent possible, both administration and military defense, and in no case south of the 38th Parallel . (3) proVide for the withdrawal by appropriate stages of non-Kofean armed forces from KOreaj (h) permit the building of sufficient ROK military power to deter or repel a renewed North Korean aggression.

In accordance With 5-d aboVe, take such current and continuing action as may be practicable to maximize the ayailability, through mutually adVantageous arrangements of the material resources of the Asian area'to the United States and the free world generally, and thereby corres- pondingly deny these resources to the communist World In accordance with the aboVe, the United States should pursue in the respective areas of Asia the courses of action set NSC 4-85 h30       . ..  . .. forth in the following paragraphs... 8.

UNITED STATES LONG-RANGE NATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN ASIA . ----------------------------------------------------------------- 2. The long-range national security objectiVes of the United States with respect to Asia are a. Development by the nations and peoples of Asia, through self-help and mutual aid, of stable and self-sustaining non-communist governments, oriented toward the United States, acting in accOrdance With the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and haVing the will and ability to maintain internal security and preVent communist aggression. , b. Elimination of the prepcnderant power and influence of the USSR in Asia or its reduction to such a degree that the SoViet Union will not be capable of threatening from that area the security of the United States or its friends, or the peace, national independence and stability of the Asiatic nations. c. Development of power relationships in Asia which will make it impossible for any nation or alliance to threaten the security of the United States from that area. d. In so far as practicable, securing for the United States and the rest of the free world, and denying to the communist World, the aVailability through mutually adVantageous arrangements, of the material resources of ' the Asian area. For the purposes of this report, "Asia is defined as that part of the continent of Asia south of the USSR and 'east of Iran together with the major off-shore islands -- Japan, Ryukyus, Formosa, the Philippines, Indonesia, Ceylen, Australia and New Zealand. NSC 485 38        ANALYSTS OF THE SITUATION 3. United States objectiVes, policies, and courses of action in Asia should be designed to contribute toward the global objectives of strengthening the free world vis-a-vis the SoViet orbit, and should be determined With due regard to the relation of United States capabilities and commitments throughout the world. HoweVer, in View of the communist resort to armed force in Asia, United States action in that area must be based on the recognition that the most immediate threats to United States security are currently presented in that areah. Current SoViet tactics appear to concentrate on bringing the mainland of Eastern Asia and eVentually Japan and the other principal off-shore islands in the Western Pacific under SoViet control, primarily through SoViet exploitation of the resources of communist China. The attainment of this objective on the mainland of Eastern Asia would substantially enhance the global position of the USSR at the expense of the United States, by securing the eastern flank of the USSR and permitting the USSR . to cOncentrate its offensive power in other areas, particularly in Europe. SoViet control of the off-shore islands in the Western Pacific, including Japan, Would present an unacceptable threat to the security of the United States. 5. Asia is of strategic importance to the United States, a. The strategic significance of Asia arises from its resources, geography, and the political and military force which it could generate. The population of the area is about 1,250,000,000, The demonstrated military capacity of the North Korean and Chinese armies requires a reeValuation of the threat to the free world which the masses of Asia would constitute if they fell under SoViet Communist domination. b. The resources of Asia contribute greatly to United States security by helping to meet its need for critical materials and they would be of great assistance in time of war if they remained aVailable, At least until stockpiling levels are met, this phase of the arears importance to the United States Will continue. Further, the deVelopment of eVents Which might lead to the exhaustion of such stockpiles would magnify'the importance of this source of supply. "The area produces practically all the worlds naturalrubber, nearly 5 Of the oil, 60 of the tin, the major part of Various important tropical products, and strategic materials such as manganese, jute, and atomic materials. Japans potential in heayy industry is roughly equal to 50% of the SoViet Union's present production. Therefore, it is NSC 485 9        important to U. S. security interests that U. S. military and economic assistance programs be deVeloped in such a manner as to maximize the availabilities of the material resources of the Asian area to the United States and the free world.  c. Control by an enemy of the Asiatic mainland would deny to Is the use of the most direct sea and air routes between Australia and the Middle East and between the United States and India. Such control Would produce disastrous moral andpsychological effects in border areas such as the Middle East and a critical effect in Western Europe. 6. The fact of Soviet power and communist aggression in Asia establishes the context within which the policies of the United States must operate. a. The problem of China is the central problem Which faces the United States in Asia. A solutiOn to this problem, through a change in the regime in control of mainland China, vzould facilitate the achievement of United States objectives throughout Asia. Therefore, United States pOlicies and courses of action in Asia should be determined in the light of their effect upon the solution of the central problem, that of China. b. The communist attack in Korea has transformed the Far East into a theater of combat. Whether the Kremlin or Peiping intends that hostilities be extended into other areas of Asia or aggression committed in another part of the world is as yet unknown. The United States must expect either eventuality. In any case, the United States should use the resources which can be disposed, Without unacceptably jeopardizing our objectives elsewhere, to prevent the communists from achieVing a Victory in Korea and to build resistance to communist encroachments in Asia. c. Our ability to achieVe national objectiVes in Asia will be conditioned by the capabilities and global commitments of . the United States and by the weight of the effort the enemy is willing and able to make. Consequently, there is required a constant and careful scrutiny of "policies and actions on the .- basis of which decisions can be made which will adVance us to- ward our ultimate objectiVes without sacrificing immediate security interests. 7. The guiding principle of U. S. foreign policy as it relates to meeting the threat of SoViet aggression is the promotion of the . establishment of a system of collective security based on the prin-. ciples of the UN Charter, The United States,is consequently forced inevitably to weigh elements of policy toward Asia against their effect upon the free World coalition a coalition fundamental to our world-wide struggle for security against SoViet aggression. t NSC 485 LLP; '   Section .3.3     8. The principal obstacles to the execution of United States policy in pursuit of its objectives in the Far East are as follows; a The nolicy and action of the SoViet Union. (1) The SoViet Communists haVe historically considered Asia as one oftheir principal objectiVes; Bolshevik ideology devotes a prominent place to the capture of the "colonial and semi-colonial" areas of the world, by which is meant principally Asia. Soviet policy in Asia has been aided by the fact that communists havo boon successful to a large degree in subVerting indigenous nationalist mOVxr-ments; the capture Of these moVements has been a goal of Kremlin policy. (2) The Kremlin has not yet resorted to the large-scale and- open employment of Soviet armed forces, although the aggression by both North Koreans and Chinese Communists indicates that the Kremlin is willing to undertake greater risks than in the past. (3) The Kremlin, besides supplying and directing lead-ership of communist parties in Asia, and building centers of subVersion, infiltration, and reVolution, is providing military assistance to communist forces in Asia, both in materiel and in technical personnel. (h) The fact that the SoViet threat is world-wide in character has prewented the concentration of free world ef- fort against the various forms of communist aggression in Asia. The combination of political, military, technical and propaganda support giVen by the SoViet Government to the communist assault in Asia confronts the United States and its principal allies with a major challenge which Vitally affects world power positions. b. The policy and action of Communist China. (1) Communist China is already involved in a major military aggression in Korea, is publicly committed to an attempt to seize Formosa, may attack Hong Kong, and may increase its support to Ho Chih Minh to include the use of Chinese forces in Indochina. Communist success in these efforts Would expose the remainder of Southeast Asia toattack and would sharply increase the threat to Japan and the remainder of the off-shore island chain. Such prospects lend greater effectiveness tC the ordinary communist ' techniques of penetration and subVersion and cause many Asians to remain on the side lines during the present  . phase of the struggle. NSC 435 '  J  .      ' Strengthening of Southeast Asia ' , r ' 41. It is important to the United States that the mainland states of Southeast Asia remain under non-communist control and continue to improve their internal conditions. These states arevaluable to the free world because of their strategic position, abundant natural resources, including strategic materials in short supply in the United States, and their large population. Moreover, these states, if adequately deVeloped and organized, could serve to protect and contribute 'to the economic progress and military defense of the Pacific off-shore islands from Japan to New Zealand. Communist control of both China and Southeast Asia would place Japan in a dangerously vulnerable position and therefore seriously affect the entire security position of the United States in the Pacific. The fall of the mainland states would result in changing the status of the off-shore island chain from supporting bases to front line positions. Further, it would tend to isolate these base areas from each other, requiring a reView of our entire strategic deployment of forces. Communist domination of the area would alleviate considerably the food problem of China and make available to the USSR considerable quantities of strategically important materials. 42. In the absence of OVert Chinese Communist aggression in Southeast Asia, the general problems facing the United States in  this area are the real threat of Chinese Communist inVasion and subVersion, the political instability and weak leadership of the non-communist governments, the low standards of liVing and underdeVeloped resources of the peoples of the area, the preVailing prejudice against colonialism and Western "interference" and the insensitivity to the danger of communist imperialism. Further acts of communist aggression in Southeast Asia can be expected to stimu- late resistance on the part of countries which haVe thus far failed to take a posltiVe stand43- Therefore, the general objectives of the United States in Southeast Asia are (a) to contribute to the will and ability of all countries in the region to resist communism from within and without, and (b) to aid in the politlcsl, economic and social adVancement of the area. For this purpose, the United States has deVeloped support programs to strengthen the governments' administratiVe and military capabilities, to improVe liVing standards, toencourage pro-Western alignments, and to staVe off communist interVention. ,  44. Chinese Communist conquest of Indochina, Thailand and Burma, by military force and internal subVesion, would seriously threaten the critical security interests of the United States. However, in the eVent of overt Chinese aggression, it is not now in . the OVer-all security interests of the United States to commit any United States armed forces to the defense of the mainland states of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the United States cannot guarantee the .NSC 485  .      denial of Southeast Asia to communism. The United States should . continue its present support programs to strengthen the will and ability to resist the Chinese Communists, to render Communist military operations as costly as possible, and to gain time for the United States and its allies to build up the defenses of the offshore chain and weaken communist power at its source. 45. The United States should deVelop its support programs in such form and in such manner in each country as will effectiVely stimulate the use of its resources to the advantage of the free world, contribute to the deVelopment of sound economies and adequate military establishments, and take into account the ability of each country to absorb and its willingness to put to effective use American aid. In any instance where a goyernmont friendly to the United States is conducting actual resistance to internal subVersiVe forces or overt aggression, the United States should favorably consider contributions to the ability of such a goVernment to continue resis- tance46. The general security problems of Southeast Asia are the subject of military staff conVersations among the United States, the United Kingdom and France47. Programs of information and educational exchange should be continued in the countries of Southeast Asia and should be designed to deVelop on the part of the gOVernments and peoples of the area, realization, and action in accordance therewith, of the Vital objectives which they share with the United States and of the ways in which the achievement of these objectives are threatened by the aggressiVe purposes of Soviet Communism. 48. At the present time, the United States faces the following major problems in Southeast Asia a. Defense of Indochina. The loss of Indochina to communist control would greatly increase the threat to the other mainland states of Southeast Asia and to Indonesia. The Viet Minh with the aid of strong Chinese Communist military intervention can conquer Indochina. Therefore, the forces opposing the Viet Minh must rapidly increase their military strength., Increased anti-communist manpower must come from the Associated States, principally Vietnam. b. Chinese Imperialism. The United States should expand and Intensify the psychological warfare effort to increase an awareness in the area of the threat which SoViet and Chinese imperialism poses to the national independence, economic betterment and traditional ideals of each country in the region. The United States should seek to reduce-.the ties be- NSC 485  3      .  < h ( .. tween the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and the Pei- ping regime, to neutralize the pro-communist support among ' these communities, and to endeayor to direct the political power and economic wealth of the Chinese communitie's toward the>support of the countries which they are resident. 1 The Role of Singapore and Malaya in the Defense of Southeast Asia. Ths location of the Malayan Peninsula makes i it of great importance to Indonesia and Australia and New Zealand in the eVent Indochina and Thailand fall to the communists. Although the defense and internal security of' Singapore and Malaya are British responsibilities, the Pe- ninsula cannot be defended against an inVasion from the north without outside support. Accordingly, the United States should coordinate its operational planning with the United Kingdom with respect to Malaya and adjacent areas. d. The Alignment of Indonesia. Indonesia's strategic position, economic wealth including oil reserves, and political importance as an independent, non-communist nation are assets to the security of the United States in the Pacific. Consequently, the policies and actions of the United States must be directed to strengthening and maintaining the non-communist political orientation of the goVernment and to promoting economic health and deyelopment. At present the Indonesian GoVernment is pursuing a policy of political neutrality. The ' United States must endeaVor to influence Indonesia touard greater participation in measures which promote the security of the area and toward solidarity with the free world. Among the factors which affect United States aid to Indonesia are (1) the results to be achieVed in terms of United States na. tional Interests, (2) the attitude of the Indonesian goVernment, (3) the needs of Indonesia, and (4) the ability to use aid profitably. The United States should give particular attention to the problem of technical assistance, in View of the serious lack of leadership and trained personnel in the country. 4$. With respect to Southeast Asia, the United States should .- a. Continue its present support programs to strengthen the will and ability to resist communist encroachment, to render communist military operations as costly as possible, and to gain time- for the United States and its allies to build up the defense of the off-shore chainb. Continue programs of information and educational ex- change in the countries of Southeast Asid., ' L. NSC 485.- r,     c. Encourage the countries of Southeast Asia to restore and expand their commerce with each other and the rest of the free world, stimulate the flow of the raw material resources of the area to the free world, and assist in establishing small arms production in appropriate locations in Southeast Asia under suitable controls. d. In Indochina (1) Continue to increase the military effectiVeness of French units and the size and equipment of indigenous units by proViding timely and suitable military assistance without relieving the French authorities of their basic military responsibilities or committing United States armed forces. (2) Continue to encourage internal autonomy and progressiVe social and economic reforms. (3) Continue to promote international support for the three Associated States. ' e. In Indonesia, the United States should seek to strengthen the non-communist political orientation of the goVernment, promote the economic deyelopment of Indonesia, and influence Indonesia toward greater participation in measures which support the security of the area and Indonesian solidarity with the free world.  5  NSC 485      0 SECRE3  694.0016-1451 Secret File From Paris, desp. 3607, June 14, 1951 .

Parodi raised the question of participation of the three Associated States of Indochina. Mr. Dulles stated that he did not think the U.S. would be opposed in principle to such participation provided it did not constitute a . precedent and commit the U.S. to treating these States as in all respects soVereign for other purposes, for example membership in the U.N., as to which matter Mr. Dulles did not know What U.S. policy would be. Mr. Dulles stated however that he anticipated that some of the other prospectlVe co-signers, such as India, Burma and Indonesia, might object to signing with the three Associated States as sovereign, particularly as there was a rival goVernment of Viet . Minh recognized by the SoViot bloc. He said that if this created serious difficulties it might be necessary for these States to participate through subsequent identical bilateral pacts with Japan. M. Parodi reiterated that it was very important for France to secure recognition of the independent sovereign status of these States.

SECRET t MEETING OF THE U.S.FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTERS FIRST MEETING, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER ll, 1951, 310 P.mExtract from Minutes1 Indochina 1. M. SCHUMAN said that his Government was preparing a note on Indochina dealing with the present troop . strength and casualties and containing a projection of plans and, problems for 1952. Without going into details it was clear that it would be Impossible for France to carry out the proposed effort in Indochina and to fulfill Its obligations with respect to the defense of Europe. France planned to spend a billion francs a day in Indochina alone and faced many problems in obtaining a maximum effort theret ugsolt wan. engaged to do. As to the financial problem the Finance Ministers would be discussingaittfurther. .In brief, af.ter July.-.l, 1952, the French vzould be unable to continue their effort at the present rate and would face a 150 billion franc deficit for the year This deficit incidentally was included in the French estimate on the dollar gap. It was not suggested that the U.S. finance French policy directly but it vias hoped that the U.S. could assist by arms and other troop supplies, especially in establishing the national armies of the Associated States. In this connection General de Lattre hoped to expand the present strength of 25,battalions to 50 battalions. 2. Mr. ACHESON said that M. Mayer, French Finance Minister, had discussed this matter with General Marshall and had made a deep impression upon him. The need for a solution was generally recognized. There was general agreement on the principle as discussed during the talks with M. Pleven, that France should continue to be primarily responsible for Indochina, that U.S. troops should not be used, and that first priority in 'military aid should go to Indochina. This difficult problem needed careful study, since funds directly aVailable for Indochina under the present aid program were not sufficient. Both General Marshall and Mr. Foster of ECA were examining' all possible ways to find other routes to reach the common goal. All that could be Cbpy'held in SS-R. For JCS position opposing commitment intlndochlna of US "Torees. "under ..such c-.ircu.m-stnces 6a oudrt-Chinese.Communist aggression",see -memorandum of JCS to Marshall(Defense), Aug. Jl, 1951, . ' . TSECREOriET .     SECRET said now was that the importance of this problem was fully understood, that the question would be giVen urgent attention, and that the U.S. had the will--even if it were not sure as.to the means--to assist in solving this problem. Perhaps General de Lattre would be able to make some helpful suggestions. 3. M. SCHUMAN said that Mr. Acheson's reply was cause for hope in the future. He recalled the first promise in May 1950 for aid to Indochina which has been effectiVe and well used. General de Lattre would dewelop more information on the long-term problem and relate it to the Singapore Conference. When he presented General de Lattre to Mr. Acheson personally on September 14 it might be possible to explore this problem further. SECRET 53     By NWD Date 201 I 751G.009-1451 Secret File SECRET Extracts from memorandum of conversation among Acheson, Schuman,, and DeLattre, Sept. 14, 1951 General de Lattre opened the conversation with the remark that he was particularly pleased to see the Secretary today for he had not expected to see him until after the Ottawa talks. That he should meet him on his first day in the United States and on the same day he had met the President was especially gratifying. He spoke of the cordial and "encouraging" interview he had had at noon with the President. He belieVed that the President had a thorough understanding of the Indochina problem and had been very reassured by his statement to the effect that l!We would not let Indochina fall into enemy hands'1. After the formalities had been completed, Mr. Schuman madeta.particular point of stating to the Secretary that he was glad to be able to present General de Lattre himsblf and to state that General de Lattre would be speaking on behalf of the French Government during his visitto the United States. The'Secretary acknowledged this fact and remarked that General Marshall, Mr.Lovett and our own officials in the Department were all looking forward to discussing the details of the Indochina problem with the General. The General spoke in some detail on the subject of the national armies. ... He hoped more progress would be made after his return from the United States with I news that the Americans had promised to support the Franco-Vietnamese program on the basis that in Vietnam, as in the rest of the Orient, nothing succeeds like success. At this point General de Lattre referred again to his hope that he would return to Vietnam, with news of a successful American trip. The Secretary stated, referring to the Departments responsibilities in the SECRET      SECRET matter, "we shall support you very strongly". De Lattre referred to the prospect of peace in Korea and his hope that, if successful, it would result in the diversion of military materiel from Korea to Indochina. The Secretary answered that he didnt think the prospects of a cease fire in Korea were particularly bright at this moment. The General expressed his theory that the Korean and Indochina wars were "one vzar" and that in order to be effectiVe there must be "one peace". Finally, Mr. Schuman spoke of the excellent impression the Associated States delegations had made at San Francisco. The Secretary agreed with this obserVatlon. The interView closed with the Generals comment that "we must saVe these countries from the fate of communism"; the Secretary reaffirmed this conViction and the Departments Intention to cooperate fully with the General in the course of his presentation to the United States authorities.

MR MERCHANT said that thd Department of State would re-emphasize to the Defense Department the political and strategic problems faced by Indochina and would make every effort to Insure that the question of equipment would receive proper attention at the Pentagon. It was the will of the Department of State, he said, to speed the delivery of military equipment to Indochina, and the urgency of the situation was well understood by Mr. Young and Mr. Bingham, both of whom were most anxious to talk with the General's staff about the specific items needed. MR. MERCHANT inquired whether the General could estimate how long a period vould elapse before the first new division of the National anjty would reach thefront, thus permitting French units to be released for European duty. GENERAL de LATTRE answered that three units of Vietnamese troops should reach the Tonkin front next month. ECA Assistance MR. MERCHANT asked whether the General wished to comment on the US economic aid program in Indochina, adding that he should realize that the U.S. felt that It vias to the common interest of both countries to give such aid directly to the governments of the three Associated States and to keep local French leaders informed of current economic arrangements. MR, MERCHANT t understood, howeVer, that the General felt that economic aid could be used more directly for military purposes. GENERAL de LATTRE replied that when he had first arrived in Indochina in December, 1950, he had felt that the aid program was not working out on a satisfactory basis. According to the General, the problem was caused by the fact that a number of young men with a "missionary zeal" vtere dispensing economic aid with the result that there was a feeling on the part of some that they were u-sing this aid to extend American influence. The results Copy held in SS-R-  . 56       could only be bad, the GENERAL explained, if somebody was attempting to "put rocks" into the machinery of the Vietnam-Franco relationships and into the machinery of Franco-American friendship, particularly when the French Commonwealth was involVed. He had informed him that since such projects were not under State Department jurisdiction, it would be advisable that the General explain his difficulties to Mr. Blum. Discussion had taken place with Mr. Blum early in August at which time the General explained that, while direct aid might rightly be sent directly to the Associated States, such economic assistance should remain within the frame- He had also if economic aid great harm would proved most been reached work of the concept of the French Union, explained to Mr. Blum at that time that were used to extend American influence, result. HoweVer, these discussions had successful and a basis of agreement had regarding the relationship between the economic aid program and the French Union. He had been informed that Mr. Blum was no longer in Indochina but hoped that his relationship with Mr. Blum's successor would be equally harmonious. MINISTER HEATH commented that he thought the past misunderstanding had been cleared up. MR. GRIFFIN concurred, saying that he did not feel that future misunderstandings would arise because liaison channels between ECA and the General's staff had improved and a continued exchange of information through informal talks had been planned. By a more acute examination of the places in which economic aid would have the most advantageous military results It would be possible to build greater faith in the program. MR. GRIFFIN added that the major purpose of the U.S. program was to make the people of Indochina feel that the economic aid was contributing to the welfare of all. GENERAL de LATTRE reiterated that the earlier disagreements were due largely to the overly zealous activity of the "young missionaries" and suggested that future programs should be directed more toward  57       strengthening the Infrastructure and toward building y roads, railroads, port facilities and factories. He suggested that the allocation of aid funds might be handled through a' committee composed of defense representatives of France, the U.S., and the Associated States. MR. MERCHANT promised that the State Department representatiVes would work actively to help the General wherever possible and suggested that the Generals staff discuss their individual problems with the military leaders.  458 .     DEPARTMENT OF STATE FOR THE PRESS NoVember 6, 1951 NO. 996 FOR RELEASE AT 1100 P.M., E.S.T.,(800 P.M.. P.S.T.) TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1951 ADDRESS BY THE HONORABLE DEAN RUSK, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FAR EASTERN AFFAIRS, TO THE SEATTLE WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1951 In Indo-China, the United States has taken a friendly interest in the efforts made to resolwe,points of difference between Franco and the Associated States and has vigorously supported the determination of France and of the Associated States to restore security and order in the country. Many Americans haVe been troubled in the past about the issue of colonialism in Indo-China. We belieVe that that question is Well on the Way to solution, that the peoples of the Associated States are free to assume the extensive responsibility for their own affairs that has been accorded them by treaties With France. It is not surprising that doubts remain on this point in Indo-China, among other countries of Asia, and among some heritage of bitterness and suspicion, those who haVe recently passed through a colonial experience are sensitiVe and distrustful of western influence, and the slowness with Which the Associated States haVe been able to assume the responsibility Which is awaiting them has not demostrated the extent to Which the issue of colonialism has been resolVed. The real issue in Indo-China is whether the peoples of that land Will be permitted to work out their future as they see fit or Whether they Will be subjected to a Communist roign of terror and be absorbed by force into the new colonialism of a SoViet Communist empire. In this situation, it is 'generally agreed in the United States that we should support and assist the armies of Franco and of the Associated States in meeting the armed threat in Indo-China and should furnish economic and technical assistance to the Associited Statos as they shoulder the heavy burdens of independence. 59      z-x 790.512-22511  File ' ..-  .

ACHESON FEISAREHoey  467 I      ANNEX TO NSC 124-SECURITY INFORMATION February 13, 1952 NSC STAFF STUDY on UNITED STATES OBJECTIVES AND COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA THE PROBLEM 1. TO determine the policy of the United States toward the countries of Southeast Asia, and in particular, the courses of action Which may be taken by the United States to strengthen and coordinate resistance to ccmmunism on the part of the gOVernments and pecples of the area, to preVent Chinese Communist aggression, and to meet such aggression should it occur. ANALYSIS I. COIfSEDUENCES TO THE UNITED STATES 0? COMMUNIST DOMINATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA .- I  .1  I 11 I 2. Communist domination of Southeast Asia, whether by means of overt inVasion, subversion, or accommodation on the part of the indigenous gOVernments, would be critical to United States security interests. Communist success in this area would spread doubt and fear among other threatened noncommunist countries as to the ability of the United States and the United Nations to halt communist aggression elsewhere. It would strengthen the claim that the adVance of ccsinunism is inexorable and encourage countries vulnerable to SoViet pressure to adopt policies of neutralism or accommodation. Successful oVert Chinese Communist aggression in this area, especially if achieved without encountering more than token resistance on the part of the United States of the United Nations, would haVe critical psychological and political consequences which would probably include the relatiwely swift alignment of the rest of Asia and thereafter or the Middle East to communism, thereby endangering the stability and security of Europe. Such a communist success might nullify the psychological adVantages accruing to the free world by reason of its response to the aggression in Korea. 3. The fall of Southeast Asia would underline the apparent economic adVantages to Japan of association with the communist-dominated Asian sphere, Exclusion of Japan from trade with Southeast Asia would seriously affect the Japanese The tern Southeast Asia is-used herein to mean Indochina, Burma, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and Indonesia. ANNEX TO NSC 12b- , ro  4bo . I       ' . SECURITY INFORMATION . economy, and increase Japans dependence on United States aid, In the long run the loss of Southeast Asia, especially Malaya . and Indonesia, could result in such economic and politicalpressures in Japan as to make it extremely difficult to pre- ' ; Vent Japan's eventual accommodation to the SoViet Bloc. 4. Southeast Asia, especially Malaya and Indonesia, is the principal world source of natural rubber and tin. Access to these materials by the Western Povers and their denial to the SoViet Bloc is important at all times and particularly in the eVent of global war. Communist control over the rice surpluses of the Southeast Asian mainland would provide the USSR With a poverful economic Weapon in its relations With other countries of the Far East. Indonesia is a secondary source of petroleum Whose importance Would be enhanced by the denial to the Western Powers of petroleum sources in the Middle East. Malaya is the largest net dollar earner for the United Kingdom, and its loss would seriously aggraVate the economic uroblems facing the UK. 5. Communist control of all of Southeast Asia vould render the United States position in the Pacific offshore island chain precarious and vould seriously jeopardize fundamental United States security interests in the Far East. The exten-. sion of communist power Via Burma Would augment the communist threat to Indie and Pakistan and strengthen the groups Within those countries Which fayor accommodation. Hovever, such an eVent Would probably result in a stiffer attitude toward communism on the part of the Indian goVernment. 6. Communist domination of mainland Southeast Asia Would place unfriendly forces astride the most direct and best-deVeloped sea and air routes betveen the Western Pacific and India and the Near East. In the eVent of global war, the deVelopment of Soviet submarine and air bases in mainland Southeast Asia might compel the detour of U.S. and allied shipping and air transportation in the Southeast Asia region Via considerably longer alternate routes to the south. This . extension of friendly lines of communication would hamper U.S. strategic moVements in this region and tend to isolate the major non-communist bases in the Far East--the offshore island chain and Australia--from existing bases in East Africa and .the Near and Middle East, as well as from potential bases on  the Indian sub-continent. 7. Besides disrupting established lines of communication in the area, the denial of actual military facilities in mainland Southeast Asia--in particular, the loss of the major nayal operating bases at Singapore--would compel the utilization of  ANNEX TO NSC 124        SECURITY INFORMATION less desirable peripheral bases. SoViet exploitation of the naVal and air bases in mainland Southeast Asia probably would be limited by the difficulties of logistic support but would, nevertheless, increase the threat to existing lines of com-  munication. II. REGIONAL STRATEGY 8. The continued integrity of the Individual countries of Southeast Asia is to a large extent dependent upon a successful coordination of political and military measures for the entire area. The deyelopment of practical measures aimed at preventing the absorption of these countries into the SoViet orbit must therefore recognize this interdependence and must, in general, seek courses of action for the area as a Whole. 9. Hovever, it must be recognized that the governments and peoples of Southeast.Asia have little in common other than their geographic proximity and their newlyawakened nationalism and anti-colonialism. For the most part, their economies are competitive rather than complementary. The countries are diVided internally and from each other by language and ethnic differences. The seVeral nationalities and tribal groups are the heirs of centuries of Warfare, jealousy, and mutual distrust. In addition, their present goVernments are sharply divided in their attitudes toverd the current East-West struggle. The goVernments of the three Associated States of Indochina are not recognized by any other Asian states except Nationalist China and Thailand. 10. In the strategic sense, the defense of Tonkin is Important to the defense of mainland Southeast Asia. If Communist forces should succeed in driving the French Union forces from Tonkin, military action in the remainder of Indochina might have to be limited to delaying action and the perimeter defense of certain coastal areas pending reinforcement or eyacuation. With the appearance of communist success, natiVe support would probably swing increasingly to the Viet Minh11. Thailand has no common border with China and no strong internal communist element. It adjoins areas of Indochina noW controlled by the Viet Minh, but the border areas a're remote and difficult. Hence, communist seizure of Thailand is improbable except as a result ofthe prior loss of either Burma or Indochina. ' 12. Communist control of either Indochina or Burma would expose Thailand to infiltration and severe political pressures, ANNEX TO NSC 124  70       SECURITY INFORMATION as Well as to the threat of direct attack. Unless substantial outside aid were forthcoming, it is possible that in such a case, political pressure alone would be sufficient to bring about the accommodation of Thailand to international communism-within a year, HoweVer, substantial aid, together with assurance of support by the United States and the UN might be sufficient to preserye a non-communist goVernment in Thailand in spite of any form of pressure short of overt attack. 13. Thailand would be difficult to defend against an OVert attack from the east by vay of the traditional inVasion route through Cambodia. Thailand is more defensible against attack from Burma oving to the mountainous terrain and poor communications of the Thai-Burmese border. In either case it might be possible to defend an area in southern Thailand centering on Bangkok. Since any attack on Thailand would necessarily be preceded by communist encroachment on Indochina or Burma, the defense of Thailand Would probably be part of a broader pattern of hostilities. 14. If the loss of Thailand followed the loss of Burma, the defense of Indochina would be out-flanked; and any substantial communist forces based on Thailand Would render the position of the French Union Forces in Indochina untenable in the long run. If the collapse of Thailand followed the loss of Indochina, the psychological and political consequences would accelerate the deterioration of Burma. HoWeVer, the military consequences in such a case Would be less immediate, ovring to the difficult terrain of the Thai-Burmese border country. 15. Communist control of Thailand 'would aggravate the already serious security problem presented by the Thai-Malayan border and greatly increase the difficulties of the British security forces in Malaya. However, assuming control of the sea by the Western Powers, Malaya offers a defensible position against eVen a full-scale land attack. The Kra Isthmus of the Malayan. Peninsula Would afford the best secondary line of defense against total communist domination of Southeast Asia and the East Indies. Such a defense Would effectiVely protect Indonesia against external communist pressure. By thus defending Malaya and Indonesia, the anti-communist forces Would continue to hold the most important strategic material resources of the area, as Well as strategic air and naVal bases and lines of communication. 16. The strategic interdependence of the countries in Southeast Asia, and the cumulative effect of a successful ANNEX TO NSC 124 k71       SECURITY INFORMATION communist penetration in any one area, point to the importance of action designed to forestall any aggression by the Chinese Communists. The most effective possible deterrent Would be a joint Warning by the United States and certain other govern-mnts regarding the graye consequences of Chinese aggression against Southeast Asia, and implying the threat of retaliation against Communist China itself. Such a warning should be issued in conjunction With other nations, including at least the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Nev Zealand. Participation in such a Warning inVolues all the risks and disadvantages of a precommitment to take action in future and unknovn circumstances. HoveVer, these disadVantages must be weighed against the alternatiVe of a costly effort to repel Chinese inVasion after it has actually occurred. A second, but probably less effective, means of attempting to deter such an inVasion vould be to focus World attention on the continuing threat of Chinese Communist aggression against Southeast Asia and to make clear to the Soviet and Chinese Communist GoVernments the fact that the United States vievs the situation in Southeast Asia with great concern. In fact, statements along these lines have already been made. Such means might also include a Peace ObserVation Commission, if desired and requested by the countries concerned, public addresses by U.S. offi- cials, and "show the flag" visits by naval-and air units. 17. The Chinese Nationalist forces represent considerable reserVe upon Which to draw in the event of military action against Communist China. The deficiency in equipment and training seriously limits the possible employment of these forces at present, hovever, continuation of our training and supply efforts should serve to alleViate these deficiencies. The manner of employment of these forces is beset not only with military but also With political difficulties. Hence the decision as to the best use of these forces cannot be made at this time. Nevertheless, We should be prepared to make the best practicable use of this military augmentation in light of the circumstances existing at the timeJ 1 . ANNEX TO ESC 124  .      SECURITY INFORMATION III. INDOCHINA 18. In the long run; the security of Indochina against colunlsm will depend upon the development of native goVernments able to command the support of the masses of the people and national armsd foreOs capable of relieVing the French of the major burden of maintaining internal security. Some progress is being mada in ths formation and dsVelopment of national armies. However, ths Vietnamese Government has been slot; to assume its responsibilities and has continued to suffer from a lack of strong leadership. It has had to contend With (a) lingerin' Vi-Stassoss suspicion of any French- supported regime, combinOd with tho apathetic and "fence sitting attitude of the bulk of the people; (b) the difficulty, common to all nev and inexperienced governments? of training the necessary pOrsortnel and building an efficient administration; and (c) ths failure of factional and sectional groups to unite in a concerted national effort, 19 The U.S. economic aid program for Indochina has as its objectiVes to increase production and thereby offset the military drain on the economy of the Associated States; to increase popular support for the GoVernment by improVing the effectiVeness of Government services; to make the Government and the people aware of Americas interest in their independence and welfare; and to use economic aid as a means of supporting the military effort. Because of their strained budgetary situation, the Associated States cannot meet the local currency costs of the projects; abcut 60 percent of the program funds is, therefore, deVOted to imperting needed commodities Which are sold to generate counterpart. 20. The military situation in Indochina continues to be one of stalemate. Increased U.S. aid to the Franco-Vietnamese forces has been an essential factor in enabling them to withstand recent communist attacks. HoueVer, Chinese aid to the Viet Minh in the form of logistic support, training, and technical adVisors is increasing at least at a comparable rate. The prospect is for a continuation of the present stalemate in the absence of interVention by important forces other than those presently engaged. 21. While it is unlikely under the present circumstances that the French Will suffer a military defeat in Indochina, there is a distinct possibility that the French GoVernment will soon conclude that France cannot continue indefinitely to carry the burden of her total military commitments. From the French point of View, the possible means of lessening the ANNEX TO NSC 12b  73       SECURITY INFORMATION present burden include (1) a settlement with the communists in Indochina; (2) an agreement to internationalize the action in Indochina; (3) reduction of the NATO obligations of France. 22. A settlement based on a military armistice Would be more complicated in Indochina than in the case of Korea. Much of'Indochina is not firmly under the control of either side, but subject to- occasicnal forays from both. Areas controlled by the opposing sides are interspersed, and lines of contact are fluid. Because of the wealmess of the natiVe goVernments, the dubious attitudes of the population eVen in areas under French control, and the certainty of continued communist pressure, it is highly probable that any settlement based on a withdrawal of French forces would be tantamount to handing OVer Indochina to communism. The United States should therefore continue to oppose any negotiated settlement with the Viet Minh. 23. In the event that information and circumstances point to the conclusion that France is no longer prepared to carry the burden in Indochina, or if France presses for a sharing of the responsibility for Indochina, whether in the UN or directly with the U.S. GoVernment, the United States should oppose a French Withdrawal and consult with the French and British concerning further measures to be taken to safeguard the area from communist domination. In anticipation of these possibilities, the United States should urgently re-examine the situation with a view to determining a. Whether U.S. participation in an international undertaking would be warranted,b. The general nature of the contributions which the United States, with other friendly goVernments, might be prepared to make. 24- . A cessation of hostilities in Korea would greatly increase the logistical capability of the Chinese Communists to support military operations in Indochina. A Korean peace would haVe an eVen more decisiVe effect in increasing Chinese air capabilities in that area. Recent intelligence reports indicate increased Chinese Communist military activity in the Indochinese harder area. If the Chinese Communists directly interVene with large forces OVer and above those introduced as indiViduals or in small units, the French would probably be drive.n back to a beachhead around Haiphong. The French should be able to hold this beachhead for only a limited time at best in the absence of timely and substantial outside support. ANNEX TO NSC 124-  474    NND 633)6.   SECURITY INFORMATION 25. In View of the world-wide reaction to OVert aggression in Korea, Communist China may prefer to repeat in Indo-0china the method of "Volunteer interVention, Inasmuch as the French do not control tha border between China and Indochina , nor large areas north of Hanoi, it may be difficult to detect the extent of preparation for such intervention. It is important to U.S. security interests to maintain the closest possible consultation with the French GoVernment on the buildup of Chinese Communist intervention in Indochina. The GoVernment of France has agreed to consult With the United States before it requests UN or other international action to oppose Chinese Communist aggression in Indochina in order that the two countries may jointly evaluate the extent of Chinese Communist intervention, 26. If it is thus determined that Chinese Communist forcea (including volunteerS) have OVertly intervened in the conflict in Indochina, or are coVertly participating to such an extent as to jeopardize retention of the Tonkin Delta by the French forces, the United States should support the French to the greatest extent possible, preferably under the auspices of the UN. It is by no"means certain that an appropriate UN resolution could be obtained. Favorable action in the UN would depend upon a change In the attitude of those governments Which View the present regime in Indochina as a continuation of French colonialism, A new communist aggression might bring about a reassessment of the situation on the part of these goVernments and an increased recognition of the danger. Accordingly, it is believed that a UN resolution to oppose the aggression, could be passed in the General Assembly by a small margin. 27. EVen if it is' not possible to obtain a UN resolution in such a case, the United States should seek the maximum possible international support for and participation in any international cOllective action in support of Francs and the Associated States.

SECURITY INFORMATION which could be furnished to bOlster the French Union forces, would be dependent upon certain factors which cannot new be predicted with accuracy. These include the extent of progress in U.S. rearmament, whether or not hostilities in Korea were continuing, and strategic developments in other parts of the world. It Wouldbe..desirable toa.VOid.the use. of major U.S. ground forces in Indochina. Other effectiVe means of opposing the aggression would include naval, air and logistical support of the French Union forces, naVal blockade of Communist China, and attacks by land and carrier-based aircraft on military targets in Communist China. The latter cculd be effectiVe against the long, tenuous, and Vulnerable supply lines by which Chinese operations in Indochina would haVe to be supported. In the eVent of a forced eVacuation, U.S. forces might provide coVer and assistance. United Kingdom participation in these measures might well result in the 1 seizure of Hong Kong by the Chinese Communists.  29. It is recognized that the commitment of U.S. military forces against Communist China Would (a) increase the risk of general hostilities in the Far East, including SoViet participation under coVer of the emisting Sino-Soviet agreements; (b) involVe U.S. military forces in anothar Asiatic peripheral action, thus detracting from U.S. capabilities to conduct a global War in the near future (c) arouse public opposition to "another Korea; and (d) imply willingness tO use U.S. military forces in other critical areas subject to communist aggression. Nevertheless, by failing to take action, the United States Would permit the communists to obtain, at little or no cost, a Victory of major world consequence, 30. Informed public opinion might support use of U.S. forces in Indochina regardless of sentiment against "another Korea" on the basis that (a) Indochina is of far greater strategic importance than Korea; (b) the confirmation of UN willingness to oppose aggression with force, demonstrated at such a high cost in Korea, might be nullified by the failure to commit UN forces in Indochina; and (c) a second instance of aggression by the Chinese Communists Would justify measures not subject to the limitations imposed upen the UN action in. Korea. 31.

We are also unable tO assess which of various COnceiVable methods of transmitting a warning would haye the greatest deterrent effect. ESTIMATE I. THE EFFECT OF A JOINT WARNING AGAINST CHINESE COMMUNIST MILITARY INTERVENTION IN SOUTHEAST ASIAOn Communist Irtentions 1. We do RO1, believe that a joint warring against ar. identifiable military intervention by the Chinese Communists in Southeast Asia wciuld tend to proycke such intervention. If, however, the Chinese Communists cor.template an early identifiable military inter Vention in Southeast Asia, cr if in the future they should contemplate such an in! er Vention, a joint warning by the fiye powers would tend to deter them. 2. Even in the abSence of a joint formal warning, the Chinese Communists probably estimate that identifiable  The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State, would add the following sentence On the other hand, if the Communist leaders conclude from Western actions and statements that the West intends to ailaak Communist Chir.a regardless Of Communist actions in SOutheast Asia, the deterrent effect Of a warning would be nullified, .  if79       military interVention in Southeast ASia would entail substantial risk Of joint miliiary counteraction, and that i such a risk is unwarranted in View of the prospects for . ' further Communist gains in Southeast Asia without such ; interVentiOn. They may, hOweyer, disccunt this risk, estimating that there are differences in policy amOng the five powers and that these powers may net be able or willing to take timely and effectiVe military counteraction. 3. The effecLiyeness of a joint warring as a deterrent would depend in large measure on Communist conviction that a. The five powers were not bluffing, and were united among themselves as 10 the military counteraction tO be taken. b. The fiVe power s were actually capable of timely and effective military counteraction. c. The counteraction would be directed against Communist China itself as well as toward repelling the Chinese Communist intervention. 4. If the Communists were conVinced on the foregoing pOints they would have to recognize that intervention in Southeast Asia would bring military counteraction, the probable  The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State hOlds the View that the Communists might be seriously con-cernecl Over the prcspeci of detayed military counteraction, eVen thOugh they believed that timely counteraction need not be feared. He therefore believes that the words timely and should be omitted.  80       consequences 0' which would bo general hOstilities batveen Communist China and. the fiVe powers, if not glObal war. It is improbable, therefore, that they would initiate an "identifiable military intervention in Indochina, Burma, or Thailand in ths face of a pint warning by the five powers unless, on the basis of global considera-' tiOns, they were willing to aecept glObal war or at least general hoStilities in the Far East. So far bcth Communist China and the USSR have shown a desire tO localize the hostilities in Korea, Indochina, Burma, and Malaya. Further-more, the favorable prOspects fOr the success of present Communist tactics in SOutheast Asia make prcbable a continuation of these tactics, unless, because of global cons ide rati 0ns, the USSR and the Chinese COmmunists decide to accept graVe risk Of glcbal war. 5. It is unlikely that additicnal signatories wculd increase the effectiveness of a jOint warning. India would alrnOSt certainly refuse to participate in such a warning. It is improbable that Japan would take such a proVOcatiVe step at this time and uncertain whether Thailand would dO so. Few, if any, additional goVernments vOuld jOin in a formal warning. EVen if the Philippines, Japan, and Thailand did participate, the Communists would discount their adherence because Of the military weakness 0 these ccuntries and their existing ties with the West. The Communists would assume Chinese Nationalist suppOrt Of the warning, whether or net explicitly expressed. , . Other Effects6. A public joint warning would Considerably imprOve the morale of the Thai and Vietnamese governments. In Burma  481 .      ' any encouragement derived frcm the warning wOuld probably be offset by fear of involvement in a conflict between the great pOvzers and by general suspiCicn of Western imperialist motiVes. 7. Elsevzhere in East and South Asia the effect would bs mixed. There would be a tendency, notably in Japan and the Philippines, to applaud this new manifesta-tiOn of Vestern determination tO check Communist aggres-sion. On the other hand, the feeling would be widespread, especially in India and Indonesia, that the warning represented another instance Ox Western meddling in Asian affairs in pur-suit Of COlOnial ObjeCtiVes. 8. The effect of a warning On Other ccuntries probably wculd not be of major importance. A warning might well reViVe the fears in the smaller NATO powers regarding the dangers of general war or Of an oVerextension of Western strength in the Far East, but it is unlikely that the basic attitudes of these ccuntries would be changed 9. The inclusion in the warning Of a threat to use atomiC weapons would produce a widespread and serious aclVerse reaction throughout the nOn-Communist world. n. INITIATION OF ACTION IN THE UN AND PROBABLE UN RE AC TIONS THE RE TO 10. If identifiable Chinese Communist military inter-Venticn ir Scutheast Asia actually took place, the UN could  482 .      probably be led to adopt courier measures similar io those taken regarding Korea if ihe US, UK, and France advocated these measures. Action by iht Security Coaccil would certainly be blcoked by a Soviet Veto, but the mailer could then be taken to the General ASsernbiy witliin twenty-four hOurs under the Uniting for Peace resolution. The General Assembly would probably begin by calling for a cease-fire. Were this action fo be ignored (as it presumably would be), a two-thirds majority could probably be mustered for resolutions cordemri-g- Communist China as ar. aggressor, recommending military counteraction to repel the aggression, and setting up a unified miliiavy command (though, not necessarily under the US) to inai e-d. Most UN members, however, because Of their tears of a general war, would probably not be willing to give specific authorization for military counteraction, against Communist China iiSelf. 11. The willingness of the UN tO adept a stand against Communist inferVentim in Southeast Asia wculd be affected by the readiness of the victim to appeal io the UN, IndOchina and Thailand would almost certainly be prompt in seeking UN assistance against Chinese Communist, military interVention, but Burma might fail to make a timely appeal or fail to support an appeal by another UN member.  12. The degree of UN support for action against Chinese Communist aggression would hinge on various other factors. A large number of Arab and Asian countries probably would abstain if IndOChina, which they regard as a French puppet, were inVaded. The Arab-Asian reaction might bs mere favorable if the victim were Burma, which has fcllOwed a policy Of r.on-inVolVernent. If the five powers took any Courte-measures without UN authorization, support of their action would be considerably lessened, .  AS 3       HI. PROSABLE EFFECTS OF THE EXECUTION OF JOINT MILI TAR Y C OUNTE RME AS URE S PteactiOn of the Chinese Commurist and Soviet GOVei nments 13. If Ihe Chinese Communis s undertook an identifiable military intervention ir. Southeast Asia despite a joint warning against such a move, Chinese Communist planning unquestionably would have considered the likelihood of Western COunteraction and would have been coordinated with the USSR. It is possible that such an intervention might be under taken in the belief that the warning was a bluff, or at leas that the courier measures would be confined to the area of the aggresSion. In this case the execution of forceful military couiietmeasures might induce the Communists to seek a sellemerd, It appears far more likely, howeVer, that such an intervention would be undertaken in full recognition Of (he risks involved. Urdet these circumstances, the immediate reaction to such military counteraction would probably bs an attempt to accelerate Chinese Communist military apetalio.es. The Cht ese CommuriSts would probably attempt to extend their opei-aiio-S to ciber parts of Southeast Asia and, having already accepted the danger of expanded hostilities, they might well ini ertsify operations in Korea and seize Hong Kong and Macao. Highest priority would be giVen, however, io ihe defense of Communist China. 14. Chinese Communist defiance of a joint warning would almost Certainly involve the prior consent of the USSR. The degree of Soviet aid to Communist China would depend up On (a) the nature, scope, and degree of success of the Western Counteraction, and (b) the degree to which the existence of the Peiping regime seemed (0 be jeopardized.

Washington 25, D. C. SECURITY INFORMATION 3 March 1952 MEiiORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE . Subject United States ObjectiVes and Courses .' of Action with Respect to Communist Aggression in Southeast Asia. 1. In accordance With the request contained in your memorandum, dated 16 February 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff haVe studied NSC 124, a draft statement of United States policy on the above subject, and a staff study relating thereto, both prepared by the National Security Council Staff. The vievs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding the proposed policies enunciated therein are set forth belov. 2. NSC 124 recommends United States courses of action in the seVeral areas of Southeast Asia. Taken either separately or together, acceptance of most of these courses of action and hence of NSC 124, inVolves the making of a single basic decision. This basic decision is Whether or not the United States, in support of the objective of NSC 124 stated as "to preVent the countries of Scutheast Asia from passing into the Communist orbit,1' vould be WILLING to take military action which Would, in effect, constitute War against Communist China. An affirmation at this time Within the National Security Council of such a Willingness does not necessarily inVolVe taking a decision now Whether or not to go to war in e.dVance o'f the nature and extent of the aggression becoming apparent. On the other hand, affirmation of this willingness should be made With a clear understanding of the implications which the adoption of these courses of action vould entail. In addition, such affirmation of this Willingness is essential in order to proVide the basis for determining a. The cost of these courses of action, in terms of men, money, and materiel; b. The impact of these courses of action upon the eccnomy of the United States; c. The impact-of these courses of action upon United States military assistance programs With particular reference to the inevitable reduction in the United States contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) effort; and  . 'SC .     '  ' ) '  . SECURITY INFORMATION d. The firmness of support of our principal allies for our global policies generally and these cour-ses of action in particular. 3. The military action, as proposed in NSC 124, would be limited as to its- objectiVes, but it would not be subject to any geographic restrictions With respect to Communist China. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that any nev communist aggression in Asia undoubtedly would stem from a deliberate design, in the formulation of which the possibility of counteraction by the United States against the source of aggression Would, in all probability, have been considered. 4. The making of such a decision nov or in the eVentuality of OVert aggression by Communist China against a country of Southeast Asia is complicated by, among other things, the folloving a. Whether or not the United Nations Would be willing to call upon its members to engage in hostilities With Communist China; . b. Whether or not the member nations of the United Nations Would be Willing to engage in military action against aggression by Communist China in Southeast Asia; p. Whether or not the United Kingdom and France vould be Willing to engage directly in military action against Communist China itself, other than action limited to the area of andcr the approaches to the lend battle with the aggressor forces; d. The ability and the Willingness of the United States to take the military actions involVed including unilateral action against Communist China itself, in ' eVent of Communist Chinese military aggression in the countries of Southeast Asia. Such actions vould call for considerable increase over current military production rates With a corresponding curtailment of the production of goods for the civilian economy; until increased U.S. production is achieved', these actions Would reduce the military assistance programs to other nations, especially those in high priority. e. The possible effect upon United States alliances in Europe and upon the United Nations organization Itself if the United States GoVernment should consider it necessary, in its own interests, to take military action unilaterally against Communist China; and  40 1       h. SECURITY INFORMATION f. The implications and the political effects of a probable refusal by the United States to provide ground i forces for collectiVe United Nations action or for com- I bined military operations in support of France and the  United Kingdom in Southeast Asia. 5. The basic decision, in light of the factors set forth in paragraph 3 above, those deVeloped in NSC 124, end the ' military considerations set forth herein, is essentially political in nature. Its resolution Will haVe direct bearing upon future United States global strategy. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that consideration by the members of the National Security Council itself of these factors and military considerations is necessary prior to any final decision regarding the policy statement in NSC 124. 6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Wish to report that, during the course of their preliminary discussions with representatiVes of the Chiefs of Staffs of the United Kingdom and France on the matter of possible courses of action to meet Chinese Communist aggression against Southeast Asia, thc British and French military position opposed eVen the .concept of action against Communist China other than that limited to the area of, or approaches to, the land battle in opposition to the aggressor forces. The Joint Chiefs of Staff belieV that the . British and French Would, at least initially, oppose taking military action against Communist China as a nation, eVen in the face of aggression. 7. The British and French appear to think almost exclusively in terms of defense, at least as far as Europe and Southeast Asia are concerned. Their unwillingness to take even, those measures for the defense of Southeast Asia Which are within their capability, indicates that they may not recognize the actual long-term danger to themselyes inVolVed in the possible loss of Southeast Asia. 8. Piecemeal actions by SoViet satellites, such as the overrunning of Southeast Asia, can eVentually lead to attainment by the USSR of its objectiVe, among others, of dominating the continent of Asia and possibly the continent of Europe. It is emphasized that each Communist gain directly involves a loss to the Western World9- The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that there vould be grave danger to United States security interests if South-ee.st Asia should psss into the Communist orbit. 10. The military problems Which vould arise as a result   88       SECURITY INFORMATION of any OVert Chinese Communist aggression against Southeast Asia are different in character and in scope from those of Korea'. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that any restrictions which Would limit the military action taken in French Indochina, Thailand, andor Burma to the area of, or the approaches to, the land battle in opposition to the aggressor forces Would result in such military action beccming Wholly defensiVe in character. Such action vould, in their opinion, at best be indecisiVe and Would probably extend OVer an indefinite period. 11. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that military measures taken to preVent the Chinese Communists from gaining control of Southeast Asia by military aggression should, from the outset, be planned so as to offer a reasonable chance of ultimate success. After consideration of the military factors in.Volved, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are of ths opinion that in order to offer such chance of success, military operations in defense against Chinese Communist invasion of French Indochina, Thailand, andor Burma must be accompanied by military action against the sources of that aggression, namely, Communist China itself. Accordingly, and in View of the fore-( going, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would recommend, SOLELY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MILITARY OPERATIONS, that a strong defense be maintained against such Chinese Communist aggression and that concurrent offensiVe operations be undertaken against the nation of Communist China. They Would point out, hovever, that this course of action, While offering promise of ultimate success, might result in a long var, and an expenslye one at least materiel-wise. 12. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of Viev, must, in any eVent, oppose acceptance of all of the military commitments deyolving from NSC 124 without a clear understanding that the United States must be accorded freedom of action and, if possible, support in the undertaking of eppro-prie.te military action to include oction against Communist China itself. Felling such freedom of action, the United States should accept the possibility of loss of at least Indochina., Thailand, and Burma. Such acceptance vould call for a United States policy Which Would limit United States military commitments in Southeast Asia to those necessary to coVer and assist possible forced eyacuations of the French andor the British from their positions. The Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirm their position that United States ground forces should not be committed in French Indochina, Thailand, or Burma and for the defense of those countries. Further, they strongly oppose the United States joining a combined military . command for the defense of those countries. 9 489       SECURITY INFORMATION 13. Military action by the United States against Communist China Would ineVitably inVolVe the acceptance of increased risks. Such risks, houeVer, should not necessarily be an overriding deterrent to United States action. As NSC 485 points out, the risk of global war "should not preclude undertaking calculated risks against specific areas in the overall interests of the United States." 14. If Communist China commits OVert major acts of aggression against French Indochina, Thailand, or Burma and if in the face of such aggression the British andor French refuse to offer either military or political support to possible United States action against Communist China itself, the effect of United States unilateral action upon our military alliances and positions in Europe as Well as in Asia should be appraised and ths risk calculated. Further, in such an eVentuality, the validity of our alliances might Well be re-examined. 15. In the light of all of the foregoing and, to meet the contingencies . a. That Chinese Communist aggression in Southeast Asia poses a threat unacceptable at that time to the position of the United States, both in the Far East and World-Wide, and b. That the United Kingdom andor France decline to support action against the nation of Communist China, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of View, strongly recommend, the inclusion in any National Security Council policy statement with respect to Southeast Asia stipulation that the United States GoVernment Will consider taking military action, unilaterally, if necessary, against the nation of Communist China. 16. Acceptance of the policies proposed in NSC 124 would serVe to increase the commitments of the United States. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that such increase should be accompanied by a substantial upvard reVision of our economic and military assistance programs fcr Southeast Asia and for Formosa and by some (possibly substantial) increase in our forces in being. In this connection, current slippages in the military production programs have already reduced planned United States and allied military readiness. There should be no increase In the risk resulting from such shortages in military production. Accordingly, the increases in our assistance programs and cur ready forces, required by acceptance of the proposed policies, vould call for a substantial L, Q q        SECURITY INFORMATION and immediate increase in the scale of United States production, and pending that increase, vould reduce the military assistance programs to other nations, especially' those in high priority. 17. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in paragraph 67 of the study in the Annex to NSC 124, Which is quoted belov for ready reference "In order to pursue the military courses of action enwisaged in this paper to a definite fayorable conclusion Within a reasonable period, it Will be necessary to divert .military strength from other areas thus reducing our military capabilities in those areas, With the recognized increased risks involVed therein, or to increase our military forces in being, or both. The magnitude of the United States military requirements to carry out these courses of action and the manner in which they could best be mot can be determined only after study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff." Such determination Will follov completion of the military studies called for in subparagraph 6c(3) of the draft policy statement in NSC 124 dealing With the military measures called for in subparagraphs 6d, ?f, 8c, 9b, and lOc thereof In . this connection, an armistice Tn Korea. Will not of itself permit major redeployment or redisposition of ground forces in the Far East in the near future except at the risk of losing Korea and endangering Japan in the eVent hostilities in that area are resumed. 18. In Connection With the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff contemplate no employment of United States ground force units in French Indochina, Thailand, or Burma; rather the Joint Chiefs of Staff anticipate that the major increase in United States forces required for contemplated operations against aggression in that area Wculd be naVal and air force units. It should be noted that the creation of any nev units Would, in general, strengthen the United States military position for the eVentuality of global war and that such forces would be capable of rapid redeployment in that eVentuality.19. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the United States military point of viev, do not Wish to join in a combined military command at this time or under present circumstances for the defense of Southeast Asia against Chinese Communist aggression. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the United States should not at this time contemplate relieVing the French of their responsibility in Indochina if present United States global strategy, includ- L91        SECURITY INFORMATION ing Francestole therein, is to be continued. Further, they feel that, While French Indochina, Thailand, andor E.urma are being defended by other friendly nations, the role of  the United States in support of such defense should be primarily military action against Communist China itself. This latter action should, of course, inVolve military support . from the British and French as veil as from other friendly nations, but should remain under the control of the United States. 20. It vill be noted that the foregoing comments are in general limited to United States courses of action relative to Indochina, Thailand, and Burma. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it premature for the National Security Council to attempt to decide now e.s to the military courses of action which vould be taken With respect to Malaya, Indonesia, or in the Southvest Pacific in the eVent the Integrity of any of these is directly threatened by foreign aggression Which could only follow aggression in Indochina andor Burma. Accordingly, in the eVent that the Chinese Communists threaten Malaya or Indonesia, the United States should then, in the light of the World situation generally and the situation in the Far East specifically at that time, consider the military measures it might take e.s a part of a United Nations collectiVe action or in conjunction With the United Kingdom and any 'other friendly governments. 21. In the light of all the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the National Security Council consider a. Whether the United States, unilaterally, if necessary, would be Willing to extend the War to the forces and territory of Communist China in eVent of Communist Chinese military aggression in Southeast Asia; b. Whether the United States should insist that French Indochina, Thailand, endor Burma be defended by . other friendly nations and that the role of the United States in support of such defense be primarily military action against Communist China itself; end ' c. Failing freedom of action against Communist China t itself, United States policy should limit United States military operations to those necessary to coVer and assist possible forced evacuation of the French andor the British from their positions22.

RiAHY A summary of our present policy and of thc proposed policy contained in NSC 134 is annexed," (Tab A)t COMMENTS OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF The Joint Chiefs of Staff have submitted eight pages of comments, including an Annex, which have oeen circulated to the Council. The primary points made by the JCS are 1. NSC 124 involves the malting of a single, basic decision, wnich is political in its nature, i.e., whether or not the United States would be willing to take military action which would in effect constitute war against Communist-China to prevent Southeast Asin from passing into the Communist orbit. They propose in effect that the NSC affirm this vill-( ingness in order to provide the basis for determining the cost of ths courses of action in terms of men, money, material, impact on the U.S. economy and upon U.S. military assistance programs. 2. The JCS report that their preliminary discussions with the Chiefs of Staff of the UK and France indicate that both are opposed to ths concept of action against Cotmtunist-China other than that limited to thc area of or approaches to the land battle in opposition to the aggressor forces. 3. The JCS believe that such limitations of the military action would result in the action being defensive in character and at best indecisive and indefinite in duration. They recommend solely from the point of view of military operations that in order to offer a chance of success military operations in defense against Chinese-Communist invasion of French Indochina, Thailand, andor Burma must be accompanied by military action against the sources of that aggression, namely, CommunistChina. itself. The JCS concede that this course of action night result in a long war and an expensive one, at least materiel-wise. 4. Ths JCS therefore insist that the U.S, must ba accorded freedom of action and if possible support in the undertaking of appropriate military action to include action against Communist-China itself. Failing such freedom of action, the U.S. should accept the possibility of the loss of mainland Southeast Asia. The JCS oppose the use of U.S. ground forces in SEA and oppose joining a combined, military command of      TOP SWT .... ' ' " SECURITY IilfCtATlCn . 5. The JCS strongly recommend the addition of a stipulation that the U.S. will consider taking military action unilaterally if necessary against Communist-C'nina. 6Approval of the policies would require a substantial upward revision of our economic and military assistance programs for SEA and Formosa, some (possibly substantial) increase in our forces in being primarily, lTavcl and Air force units , and a substantial and immediate increase in the scaleof U.S. production. ? Further military studies relating to the magnitude of militaryrequirements to carry cut these courses of action and the manner in which they could best be met will be furnished in due course to the 1TSC. CO'-n'TS 0? THE JOINT S-CR-I'ARIES The Joint Secretaries have not yet submitted any written comments. INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES A CIA Special Estimate (SS22) (Tab B), and HIE 351, "Probable Developments in Indochina in 1952'W (Tab C), relate to 'ISC 124. RECOMlnENOATIOiTS . 1. That you discourage the malting of any policy decisions by the ' NSC at this meeting. Elis natter was put on the agenda of this nesting so that the President could discuss it with the Council before leaving on his vacation. He understands that the natter has not progressed far enough for final decision. There has not been sufficient time for anyone fully to consider the comments of the JCS. The JCS themselves need further tine to complete their studies of the military requirements involved and the impact of fulfilling these requirements on other programs and on our global strategy. 2. That the paper be referred back to the Senior Staff for revision in the light of the Councils discusSion and the additional information which will be brought to bear on the problem. The Senior Staff would, of course, take .into account the general and specific comments of the JCS together with the further military studies which the JCS will submit to then. 3. That you advise the Council that in your opinion the basic decision involved, in this paper should, not be taken until the military implications have been fully explored; that you are requesting the JCS to proceed immediately with studies of the nature referred, to in their nemornndu-j, with a view to providing the fullest possible information to the 30 this on the planning assumption that the decision '.-ill be      ; I ;l ' taken and that the British and French will support the action It would Seem inappropriate to make a deci Sion as to our willingness to go to war without having fully explored the military implications. It would appear desirable for you to take tho position that the Defense Department is not prepared to make such a recommendation to the President until it is satisfied that the military implications are acceptable and it had full opportunity to explain its findings and conclusions to the Council and the President. 4. That you raise the question whether, in view of the crucial importance of reaching agreement with the French and British, tha Council should contemplate reaching a firm national policy decision before such negotiations are undertaken. In view of the great complexities of the problem involved  and the heavy reliance we necessarily must place on our allies in regard to SEA, it would be perhaps more sensible to postpone a final Government decision on SEA policy until after further exploratory talks with the British and French either on the Governmental or the politicalmilitary level. 5. That you. indicate that in your view it is unnecessary and unwise for us to contemplate unilateral action against CommunistChina under present circumstances; and in view of the possibility of leaks, etc., you would prefer that no reference be made to this possibility in the present NSC policy paper. You night point out that as far as overt aggression is concerned, our main objective is to deter it by a Joint warning. We should not engage in a Oluff. The primary need is, therefore, to reach sufficient agreement with the U.K. and France as to courses of action to permit the issuance of such a warning. f I 6. That you express the view that the present paper concentrates far too heavily on action to be taken against aggression? that by far . the greater danger is that Southeast Asia will fall to subversive tactics; that in the absence ofovert aggression it is probable that before long France will be unable or unwilling to continue to carry the burdens of the civil war; that the paper proposes no courses of action to meet these contingencies which are co-mensurate with the burdens and risks which it proposes we assume to deal with the lesser 'risk of aggression; and that you propose that this deficiency in the j paper ha remedied by the Senior Staff in their next draft. J This is a major deficiency in the proposed, policy. If nothing is to be cone beyond what is now being done to prevent Communist subversion in this area, there is grave doubt as to the wisdom of assuming 504 xj      L 'I very grave risks of general war in an attempt to save the area from further overt aggression. Most of the actions version lie in ths political this danger and of improving of U.So supervision over the particularly with respect to available to deal with the danger of sub-and economic fields,. One means of reducing the situation would involve a greater degree uSe of U.S. military assistance in Indochina the development of the native army. 1 t i J .     SUI1ARY GF Eli SENT POLICY AND  .. PROPOSED tOL-OI 0110.-010 IK . 450 Present Policy  Our present policy ir the Far East, as set forth in "SC 485, diaws the line which the United States will go to war to defend along thc offshore inland chain, namely, Japan, the Ryukus,. the rhilippines, Australia and NeW Zeland, with special treatment of Fontosa. With respect to Southeast Asia, the substance cf out policy is to continue our present auppert proems to strengthen the will and ability to resist Comunist encroacic-cnt and render Co.uni-t military operationsas costly as possible, and thus to gain time -or the United States and its allies to build up the defense of the offshoro island chain. With respect to the fighting already going on in Indochina, the policy is tc give military supplies to the French Union forces on a high priority basis but tc- avoid relieving the French authorities of their basic military responsibilities, and to avoid conmitting United States aimed forces under any cireamstarces. The present policy does not appear to result from a lack of a-rareness of the great importance of the Southeast Asian nations, both strategically and in terms of their rat; material resources, but on a recognition of the difficulties involved in holding the area. The States cf those areas are inherently weak anc. there are formidable difficulties involved in building up the will of the peoples in the area to resist Communist encroachment. One of the greatest of these difficulties is the inability of thc French to enlist the support of the IndoChinese cr of neighboring States in support of their fight against Cornunisu due to the fselirj against French colonial rule. In the face of these difficulties, the worlc'-vidc cc.T-ltmcnts of the United States and the obvious military difficulties of utilising United States forces in an effective defense cf iSunia, Thailand and Indochina, it has been the Government's position that it could not undertake to ccrrit United States forces to defend the area aairst aggression even though it is of great importance. Preposed Policy  The policy paper under consideration proposes several major changes. It proposes A. That in case of overt' aggression of Comunist-China against Burma, Thailand er Indochina, the United States take appropriate military action against Co?.-.unist-Chins. consistent with our world-wide GGr itments provided the united Lattens will act or the British and French will join. r. That in an attempt to deter China from such overt action, we issue a joint warning with a nun.b.r of oth.r States tlnat we shall, take military action in such an event, provided that at least the British and French will agree to such a joint warning and to the genera? plan of action in case the warning is ignored.       .1 , C. That in case of overt aggre scion, Chinese Nationalist forces would be employed as desireble and feasible in milit-ry operations in Southeast Asia, Korea, cr China proper, , nJ The proposal policy wiuh reference tc the Malay States and Indonesia is thatj appropriate military action should ce taken to defend them, thereby in effect placing the; ;.ithlri the offshore island defense chain. It is con-templatcd that in case the three mainland States fall, the rritieh ground forces in Malaya, cc-cined with British and United States naval, and sir power, could defend these areas. E. With respect to the threat of Cobnurtist subversion of the Southeast Asian States, the paper ccnterpla tea minor changes, such as a. Strengthen psychological activities b. Encourage trade aid cooperation with Western countries c. Strengthen covert operations d. Promote tne co-ordinated defense of the area. No increase is conte .plated in our cconcr ic and technical assistance programs, or rilir-ary aid pTcjrr. iinor recognition is givon to ths danger that France may not be Willing much longer to carry thc burden in Indochina, but the paper provides only fcr consultation with the French and British and opposition to French. Lithdraual in this event, A major strengthening 'of our policy in Indo-r.esia is contemplated by a provision that in case of seizure or attempted seizure of power by internal Ccrc .unist action, we Would take appropriate military action consistent with our world-wide corritrents to prevent Communist control of the area.

Tin-tnary Views Concerning British Memorandum of March l5th Regarding Indochina PARTICIPANTS The Secretary Sir Oliver Franks, British Ambassador Mr. Gibson, PSA COPIES TO The Secretary G SP . EUR (2) FE SS After the customary amenities, the Secretary proceeded to give response to the British memorandum of March l5th, point by point, as outlined in Mr. Allisons guidance memorandum of March 25th. After he had finished the Ambassador expressed his thanks and asked if he night summarize the Secretarys presentation in order to check. He did so as follows , nWe do not believe that the British concern regarding French intentions in Indochina is justified and cite Mr. Letourneaus comments made at his press conference March l2th to substantiate our point of view0 Wo have no evidence that any of the rumors cited in the British memorandum as indications of French intention to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh or withdraw from Indochina aro true. Wo would be gratified to havo proof of any or of all of them. If it were obtained wa would consider it necessary to reconsider our policy concerning tho French and Indochina generally, Ue believe that the French will stay in Indochina providing I they have (a) assurances of continued US military aid, (b) sufficient financial aid to assist them with that portion of their budgetary deficit attributable to tho Indochina oporation and, (c) reason to oxpcct that a solution can be found to 'their manpower problem, It is suggested thet this solution lies in tho formation of national armies. Ue do not believe that tho French are negotiating with Ho Chi Minh if only for the reason that Ho does not choose to negotiate and could not cven if he wished to do so. Wo do not belicvo that the Fronch arc planning a withdrawal if only for the roason that such an operation could not be accomplishod successfully without tho assistance of tho British and ourselves. Wo '  SECURITY INFORMATION . 508       SECURITY INFORMATION may therefore expect prior notice. We had hoped to be proparcd to present moro specific US views on tho nature and extent of retaliatory action against Communist China following an identifiable aggression in Southeast Asia and othcr related subjects to tho British by this timo but havo not yet been able to do so We are finding it difficult to reconcile tho proposed diplomatic and military courses of action. Progress is bcing made and it is hoped that sonothing will bo ready in thc near future.1 (Note Here tho Secretary apparently had NSC 124 in mind although he made no direct referenco to it.) The Sccrctary confirmcd to tho Zanbassador that theso wero our main points. The Ambassador referred to the increasing concern in London with Southeast Asia. H.M.G. is concerned not only with tho present precarious ; situation in the area, a concern which has been greatly accentuated in recent weeks by thc'ir suspicions of French intcntions in Indochina, but ; also with tho snowballing effects of any action which might follow a further Chinese aggression. Tho question of Korea is of course relatcd to thoir concern. .. The Ambassador then noted that tho last Ad Hoc Military Committee?s findings wore a failure in that they resulted only in tho presentation of thrco parallel sets of views which ncver not. The time is now fitting, in tho opinion of H.M.G., to make a serious effort to rcconcilo US and UK views. It is therefore requested that we give urgent thought . to tho following proposal, A politico-military conference bo hold as soon as possible in which a limited number of British and American military and Foreign Office officials should tako part. Ho spoke of himself, Mr. Matthews, General Bradley and Marshal Elliot, In answer to tho Secretary question ho replied that he did not propose that the Joint Chiefs or any other group bo brought from London in order to participate. He beliovos that the conversations should be concerned with the hypothesis that tho Chinese Communists would commit an overt aggression in Indochina that we were rcsolved to oppose that aggression and that our objcctivo was to combat the aggression itself and not necessarily to overthrow thc Chinose Peoples Republic, On that basis wo would concern ourselves with tho following two considerations (a) the kind of retaliatory action which wo aro ablo to tako and its expectcd effectiveness, and (b) an assossmeht of what would bo tho results of tho retaliatory action in bringing tho Sino-Soviet pact into operation. The Ambassador stated that H.M.G. believes that any Chinese aggression could bo countered not only whore it takes plnco but also, to a limited degree, at the base of the cnenys operations in China without-bringing the Sino-Soviet pact into operation. Tho question to be doterninod, however, arises out of tho difference) of opinion bctwocn tho UK and tho US as to whore that limit is to bo found,  SECURITY INFORMATION 509    NND 63316,  >  SECURITY INFORMATION Tho Ambassador emphasized that it is suggested theso discussions were to bo carried on without any ccmmitncnt of any kind by either government. In commenting.on tho AmbassadorTs suggestion tho Secretary noted that the studios of thc last Ad Hoc Comittce appointed by the Tripartite Military Conforcnco had not achieved their purpose because tho British participants were hampered by the fact that they gave first consideration to tho policy questions behind any proposed military action while the Ancrican representatives thought only of tho effectiveness of tho action without considering policy at all. Ho said that thare had not been enough advance thought concerning tho subject cn either side. Tho Secretary stated in closing that he would malto the British proposal known to the appropriate American officials on Monday, March 3lst, and hoped to bo ablo to give tho Ambassador a prompt reply.

The Secretary raised question position US-UK-Fr in event Chinese Commies took more active part in Indochina and said US now prepared discuss question joint position with UK and France, at political and military levels. He stressed importance preventing action rather than acting after eVent, raised question joint warning to Chinese Commies, and stressed importance discussing possible action if warnino disregarded. He stated as preliminary view actions should be taken against Chinese attack in Indochina. He said questions should be discuss, d first in political talks and then military, perhaps at Paris.

June 17, 1952 Following his telephone conversation with Sir Oliver Franks today, which is reported separately, the Secretary saw General Bradley and . Mr, Perkins. Later Sir Oliver dropped in at the office following a meeting in Mr. Jessups office. Fie asked if he could see the Secretary for a few minutes to get the further report on the matter of talks on Southeast Asia. He repeated what he told us earlier that he had had a second message from London following the report which the Embassy had sent of Mr, Perkins conversation with Mr. Steele. The Secretary said that he had talked about this matter with General Bradley this afternoon and that Friday was the only day which General Bradley could possibly meet and that was very inconvenient for Mr. Acheson. He said, therefore, he thought that any talks were impossible to arrange. He then said that he would be glad to talk to Sir Oliver right at that(moment and see where we stood. The Secretary reviewed the situation and the talks which took place in Paris. He said that in the earlier meetings which had taken place on Southeast Asia, everyone had started from a different point and there had been little in the way of conclusion reached. He said that he felt what was needed now was political decisions. The Secretary then analyzed the situation as we saw it. He -.said that if the Chinese came into Indochina in force, we would have to do something. We could not remain passive. He said that none of the things we could do were very pleasant ones and we felt that a warning was highly lesirable. He said that wc felt we should not give a warning, however, if there had been no agreement on what we did in the event the Communists movcd in anyway. He said this would make us look very silly and would weaken the effect of any other warnings. SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION 515      . "C'-b SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION He said it was clear that it was futile and a mistake to defend Indochina in Indochina. He said we could not have another Korea. He said it was also true we could not put ground forces in Indochina. We do not have them and we could not afford to immobilize such forces as we had. He said we could take air and naval action, however, and had discussed whether this should be confined to approaches. He concluded that our only hope was of changing the Chinese mind. He said that we could strike where it hurts China or we could set up a blockade against trade. He said we had concluded that our mission would not be to destroy the Communist regime. He also said that we fully realized the danger of bringing the USSR into the show. The Secretary concluded that there was no point in getting our military people into any talks. He said we must get political decisions first. He said that if firm decisions could not be reached that we  perhaps could reach tentative decisions. He said that it had been clear at Paris that he was somewhat "ahead of the play" while the French and the British had urged us to discuss these matters and had wanted discussions before decisions were made. When the question actually came up, they were not ready to talk. The Secretary remarked that Mr. Letourneau had said in Paris that the military talks had reached some decision as to how to evacuate the wounded, etc., in the event of difficulites. He said that our Navy had talked to Mr. Letourneau regarding port sizes, capacity of ships, etc., with regard to evacuation. Sir Oliver said he thought he understood the point, would report back to London and would let us know if there were anything further on it. Mr. Acheson said that if his analysis were Wrong and the British Chiefs of Staff had any different one, he would be glad to hear of it. S LDBattle SECRET..

DEPARTMENT OF STATE i FOR THE PRESS JUNE 18, 1952 NO. 473 Secretary Acheson made tho folloving statement at his news conference today VISIT OF M. JEAN LETOURNEAU . As you are aware, M. Jean Letourneau, Minister of the Associated States for the French GoVernment, has been spending the last feW days in Washington exchanging Views with representatiVes of Various agencies of this Government. The Ambassadors of Cambodia and Vietnam haVe also participated in conVcrsations with M. Letourneau and with our own representatiVes. A communique covering the substance of the talks will be issued later today and I will therefore not go into details now. Yet I would like to share With you the feeling cf encouragement and. confidence Which M. Letourneau inspires. Kis thorough grasp of the situation and his constructiye approach to tho problems involved -military, political and economichaVe impressed us all. As you know, the Communist aggression.in Indochina has been going on for six years. It has been greatly stopped up because of assistance receiVed from Communist China during the past two years. Yet, under French leadership, the threat' to this part of the free World has been met With great courage and admirable resourcefulness. The military situation appears to b deVeloping fayorably. It has been good to hear from M. Letourneau of the part played in achieving this result by the considerable quantities of American arras and material Which the magnificent fighting qualities of the French Union forces, including those of the Associated States, haVe justified us in deVoting to this area of the struggle against Communist aggression. The effort to cake of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia secure and prosperous members of the free World community has made great progress. I hay been particularly impressed by what M. Letourneau has told me of what is being done to enable the people of the three Associated States to play the constantly greater role in their own defense to Which they rightly aspire. Much has been accomplished tovard the creation, training and equipping of the national armies. Units of these armies have distinguished themselVes 518 .     in battle and aro performing vital security functions in . many parts of the country. They look forward with confi- dence and determination to assuming an increasing chare  of the burden of carrying on tho struggle. Their ef- fectiVcness full justifies tho program of expansion to ' which the goVernments concerned aro committed and under- lines, I belieVe, the soundness of our own decision, ( subject of course to the aVailability of Congressional ' 1 appropriations, to render increasing assistance in building these armies, M. Letourneau described these programs in tho course of his address before tho Oyer- seas Writers yesterday. Favorable deVelopments haVO not been confined to the fighting fronts and to the national armies. There are increasing evidences of the growing Vitality of the Associated States in handling their political, financial and economic affairs. M. Letourneaus account of the manner..'in which' those new member States of tho French Union are envisaging and meeting their responsibilities was heartening. I do not think it is generally realized to what extent these new states in fact control their own affairs. Only a limited number of services related to the necessities of the war remain temporarily in French hands. Wo in the United States are aware of the vital importance of the struggle in Indochina to the cause of the free world. We haye earmarked for Indochina economic and materiel aid to a considerable amount during the past tvo years. We aro doing our best to activate dellVeries as you are aware the l50th ship boaring American arms and munitions to Indochina arriVed in Saigon within the last few weeks. We are not bearing a considerable portion of the total burden of the War in Indochina expressed in financial terms, although of course the entire combat burden is being carried by the French Union and the Associated States With the latter assuming a constantly increasing shareThe Communists haV made a most determined effort in Indochina. Their aggression has been checked and recent indications Warrant the VieW that the tide is noW moVing in our fayor. Once again the policy of meeting aggression with force is payin off and ve can I belieVe ba confident that as ve carry out the plans upon which we haVe agreed we can anticipate continued fa'Vorable deVelopments in the maintenance and consolidation of the free world bulwark in Indochina. 519 .

SECURITY INFORMATION STATEMENT OF POLICY ' by the NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL on UNITED STATES OBJECTIVES AMD. COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA  OBJECTIVE 1. To preVent the countries of Southeast Asia from passing into the communist orbit, and to assist them to deVelop the will and ability to resist communism from within and without and to contribute to the strengthening of the free world. GENERAL CCNSIDERATIONS 2, Communist dominations by whateVer means, of all Southeast Asia would seriously endanger in the short term, and critically endanger in the longer term, United States security interests. a. The loss of any of the countries of Southeast Asia to communist control as a consequence of OVert or coVert Chinese Communist aggression would haVe critical psychological, political and economic consequences. In the absence of effectiVe and timely counteraction, the loss cf any single country would probably lead to relatiVely sWift submission to or an alignment with communism by the remaining countries of this group. 9 Furthermore, an alignment with communism of the reSt of 3outhe-ast Asia is used herein tO mean the area embracing Bursa, Thailand, Indcchina, Malaya and Indonesia. NSC 124-2 522        SECURITY INFORMATION Southeast Asia and India, and in-the longer term, of the Middle East (with the probable exceptions of-at least Pakistan and Turkey) would in all probability progress- i iVely follow. Such widespread alignment would endanger the stability and security of Europe. b. Communist control of all of Southeast Asia would render the U. S. position in the Pacific offshore island chain precarious and Would seriously jeopardize fundamental U. S. security interests in the Far East. c. Southeast Asia, especially Malaya and IndOnesia, is the principal world source of natural rubber and tin, and a producer of petroleum and other .strategically important commodities. The rice exports of Burma and Thailand are critically important tO Malaya, Ceylon and Hong Kong and are of considerable significance to Japan and India, all important areas of free Asia. d. The loss Of Southeast Asia, especially of Malaya and Indonesia, could result in such economic and political pressures in Japan as to cake it extremely difficult to preVent Japans eVentual accommodation to communism, 3. It is therefore imperative that an OVert attack on Southeast Asin by the Chinese Communists be Vigorously opposed In order to pursue the military courses of action enVisaged in this paper to a faVorable conclusion within a reasonable period, it will be necessarytc dlVert military strength frcn! NSC 1242 523       TOF SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION other areas thus reducing our military capability in those areas, with the recognized increased risks inVolVed therein, or to increase our military forces in being, or both. 4- . The danger of an oVert military attack against Southeast Asia is inherent in the existence of a hostile and aggressive Communist China, but such an attack is less probable than continued communist efforts to achieVe domination through subVersion. The primary threat to Southeast Asia accordingly arises from the possibility that the situation in Indochina may deteriorate as a result of the weakening of the resolVe of, or as a result of the inability of the goVernments of France and of the Associated States to continue to oppose the Viet Minh rebellion, the military strength of which is being steadily increased by Virtue of aid furnished by the Chinese Communist regime and its allies. 5. The successful defense of Tonkin is critical to the retention in non-Communist hands of mainland Southeast Asia. HoweVer, should Burma come under communist domination, a communist military adVance through Thailand might make Indochina, including Tonkin, militarily indefensible. The execution of the following U. S. courses of action with respect to indiVidual countries Of the area may Vary depending upon the route of communist adVance into Southeast Asia. 6.

Continue to assure the French that the U.S. regards the French effort in Indochina as one of great strategic importance in the general international interest rather than in the purely French interest, and as essential to the security of the free vorld, not only in the Far East but in the Middle East and Europe as well.

Our influence with the French and Associated NSC 1242  528       SECURITY INFORMATION States should be designed to further those constructiVe political, economic and social measures which will tend to increase the stability of the Associated States and thus make it possible for the French to reduce the degree of their participation in the military, economic and political affairs of the Associated States. e. Specifically we should use our influence with France and the Associated States to promote positiVe poli tical, military, economic and social policies, among Which the following are considered essential elements (1) Continued recognition and carrying out by France of its primary responsibility for the defense of Indochina. (2) Further steps by France and the Associated States toward the evolutionary development of the Associated States. (3) Such reorganization of French administration and representation in Indochina as will be conduciVe to an increased feeling of responsibility on the part of the Associated States.

(8) US-French cooperation in publicizing progressive deVelopments in the foregoing policies in Indochina. 9. In the absence of large scale Chinese Communist interVention in Indochina, the United States should- a. ProVide increased aid on a high priority basis for the French Union forces without relieVing French authorities of their basic military responsibility for the defense of the Associated States in order to (1) Assist in developing indigenous armed forces Which will eVentually be capable of maintaining in- ternal security without assistance from French units.

In the eVent that it is determined, in consultation with France, that Chinese Communist forces (including volunteers) haVe OVertly interVened in the conflict in Indochina, or are covertly participating to such an extent as to jeopardize retention of the Tonkin Delta area by French Union forces, the United States should take the folloving measures to assist these forces in preventing the loss of Indochina, to repel the aggression and to restore peace and security in Indochina; a.

EDEN opened the conversation on Indo-China by stating that it might.be well, during the bilateral discussions, to go over tojethcr whet could be said to Mr. Schuman in the trilateral discussions. He anticipated that Mr. Schuman might take the by now familiar line that there was little prospect for victory in IndoChins and that, unless a general settlement were reached, the best we could Lope for would be a stalemate. This did not accord to the understanding of the British OoVern-ment, which has the impression that the situation is improving somewhat; certainly there 'is a better govern-ment, there is wider representation in the goVernment, and active Vietnamese participation. M. EDEN said that he planned to discuss the situation with Mr. Schuman alon<, such lines in the hope of stimulating his morale and divorcing him from his relatively defeatist attitude. TRE -ECRETAEV replied that he had been discussing Indo- . China with the French along the lines he end nr. Eden had taken in the tripartite discussions in Paris.

He added that the United States, feeling that the French military training program was badly strained, had offered ; ' to assist them in this respect, but that the French, always skittish ouer what they might regard as undue American interference, had not taken up this offer. Certainly it is not up to the Americans to press on the French assistance along these lines.

He asked Dr. Jessup to read the text of the Departments telegram 20lt, June 18, to Saigon, summarizing the discussions . with Letourneau. THE SECtiETAlV said that he had warned the French that success in the military field in Indo-China carried with it certain dangers, including the increased possibility of a large-scale Chinese Communist military intervention. He said that this in turn points up the question, How can we preVent this from happening?" he felt it would be desirable to issue a warning statement of some sort, whether public, private, detailed and specific, or otherwise, but it vould be essential to have a general understanding as to the action vh ich we mioht take if the warning were to go unheede.d To issue a warning and take no effective action would be calamitous. Terhaps the United States and the United Ringdon, preferably in conjunction with France, .Australia, and New Zealand, can reach a tentatiVe agreement on political policy in this regard which would form a framework for joint military planning. This, in turn, leads to the major question What form could retaliation against aggression take?" The American military authorities are of the strong opinion that action only against the approaches to IndoChina would be ineffectiVe. In fact, the first problem which we would likely have to face would be the evacuation of French military and ciVilians from Tongking. A.ction confined to the air and naval arms directed against the Chinese C oramunists in< Indo-China 'vould likewise be ineffective and, in thc liont of world commitments, the United States has no infantry av-ileble i'or operations within  SecurityInformation 536       T 0 r L. C R E T LecU?1ty Information within Indo-China. The United States thinking is along the lines of a blockade of the coast of China, combined with air action, designed to upset the economy of mainland China and to lessen the vi 11 of tire Chinese Communists to continue their agression. Such tction would cease when aggression ceased, nd this would be made clear to everyone. Every effort should be made to aVoid action in the areas of acute sensitiVity to the SoViet Union. ..e are of ths opinion that the Soviet Ur.icn vould probably not enter the conflict if it understood clearly th we had no intention of attempting to OVsrthrow the Chinese Communist regime by force. e must bear in mind that the Chinese Communists have a formidable air force, end we may be forced to attack it vherever it is found. If the Chinese Communists do invade Indo-Chin- in substantial force, it will be a threat to the Vit.,l interests of all of usMn. EDEN said that he sow no serious objection to the issuance of c. w-rning; he recalled that he had already issued a public ..rnino m his speech at Columbia University. rte felt that, whether or not a varnino is issued, it would be important to have the Chinese Co..;mun-ists know that retaliation against further Chinese aggression is beino urgently considered. 1HE SECRCThW reiterated th-1 there was an urgent need for basic political ouidunce on the basis of which military talks could proceed, liu. EDEN said that tie would wish to consult the Cabinet on basic policy, noting that a naval blockade inyolving nong hong was a serious question. t There was general agreement th-t the Secretary and Mr. Eden would conduct their discussions with Mr. Schuman along the aboVe lines.

Re DEPTEL 1141, December 3. The French have not (rpt not) asked for additional aircraft What they do request and General Trapnell is urgently recommending is that the 30 F-8s already programmed be expedited to arrive here not (rpt not) later than January aid that delivery of the 8 B-26fs scheduled to arrive at rate of one a month during calendar year 1953 be accelerated. The French yesterday made, however, urgent request on which in Trapnell's and my opinion immediately favorable action in some form or other should be taken. The request is that 150 Amcrican A.ir Force mechanics be detailed immediately to Nhatrang Air Base for one month to give 5O-hour checks to 18 C-47s and 100 hour checks on another 18 C-47's. Nhatrang was chosen presumably because presence mechanics would be less conspicuous than if detailed to at Tonkin base or to Saigon. The French have made the same imperative request of the French Air Ministry, but according local information, French Metropolitan Air Force has only a few if any surplus mechanics for immediate despatch. The French request is entirely legitimate. when Salan asked for and was granted the 50 additional C-47s late CBECRET SEIuRTrPJNFORMATTON, 538      . ,  SECURITY INFORMATION- . >> I. Ml >!- eI. ,1 ..last summer (21 were provided by US), sufficient crews were available for normal maintenance. It was expected these would be used for tactical drops of parachute troops. No (rpt no) sustained air lift operation was or could have been forseen at that time. With loss of Nghialo and the ensuing necessary decision of French command. to attempt hold Na San to prevent overrunning that country and Laos, an air lift had to be instituted. As a result, the C-47s are operating at several times the normal rate, entailing urgent increased maintenance. As an alternative to sending American mechanics, Trapnell and I have suggested possibility of the 36 planes being sent for repairs and checks to Clark Field. Trip to Manila would add extra flying time to the planes, but that might be the more practical operation. I can see no (rpt no) policy objection either to despatching American maintenance crews for a few weeks stay here or providing maintenance at Clark Field. On several occasions we have provided mechanical specialists for brief periods for instruction and repair of certain American equipment. This emergency maintenance is vital to holding of Na San and for meeting any other emergency air-borne operations. General Chassin, CINC French Air Force Fe, arrives today from Tonkin to consult with Trapnell, .
