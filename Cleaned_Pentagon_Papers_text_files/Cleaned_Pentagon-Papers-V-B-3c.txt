The State Department explains the rationale of why the United States issued a unilateral declaration instead-of signing the 1954 Accords on Indochina. Secretary Dulles was unwilling to even consider signing accords on Indochina of the type concluded at Geneva, and hence . ' was not an alternative to issuing a unilateral declaration but was a substitute suggested by the French leaders. The declaration was based on the understandings of the 14 July Franco-American Six Point position paper. State Department AnalysisGeneva Declaration... 676  . 186. The NSC adopts the JCS recommendation that the possible . use of ROK forces in Indochina be kept under review. Secretary of Defense Memorandum to JCS, 30 July 1954. 679 1S7. Dulles reviews the occasions when French officials suggested U.S. armed intervention in Indochina and the parallel U.S. efforts to organize "united action." The possibility of "united action" lapsed in mid-June 1954 with the French decision to obtain a cease-fire . at Geneva. Dulles 689 to London, 3 August 1954... 680 . 188. The CIA assesses the probable outlook in Indochina in the light of agreements at the Geneva Conference. The conclusions are(1)that the communists will continue to pursue their objectives in South Vietnam by political, psychological and paramilitary means; (2) that if . elections are held in 1956, the Viet Minh will win; (3) and that the events in Laos and Cambodia depend on the developments in Vietnam. National Intelligence Estimate, NIE 63-5-54, 3 August 1954... 691 189 The French view of Diem Government is that it does not qualify on three major points (1) fully representative of the population; (2) prepared to carry out land reform; and (3) prepared to depose Bao Dai. Diem is seen as valuable for-his high moral character but his mandarin background precludes his qualifications on the three . points. Paris 481 to Dulles, 4 August 1954. 699  190. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that before the U.S. assume responsibility for training the Vietnamese Army that four preconditions be met (1) "it is absolutely . essential that there be a. reasonably strong, stable . civil government in control"; (2) each government concerned should formally request the U.S. to assume the responsibility; (3) arrangements should be made for TOP SECREI .- e > ,& xxxi      '  Page , . granting full independenc'e and provide for phased withdrawal of French forces; and (4) the force structure . should be dictated by local military requirements.

Saigon 3O24A,  8 August 1954.. 703 192. The French have been lead to believe that Dulles made an offer of the use of atomic bombs at Dien Bien Phu and that Bidault was "much upset" by the offer and felt that they would have done no good tactically. There is concern that Bidault "ill, nervous, hypersensitive and bitter" might attempt to publicise his version and take credit for preventing the use of atom bombs as "suggested by the U.S." Paris 558 to Dulles, 9 August . 1954.. 705 193. Dulles has "no recollection whatever of the alleged offer" of atomic bombs to the French and indicates "it is incredible that I should have made the offer " Dulles 501 to Paris, 9 August 1954. FO6 . 194. On the offer of atomic'bombs, the French agree that there has been a complete misunderstanding, possibly based on language difficulties. On the day of Dulles, "alleged" offer, Bidault had. been "ill, jittery, overwrought" and, even to the French staff, "incoherent." . Paris 576 to Dulles, 10 August 1954 908 . , i 195.

The JCS concur in the view that a statement of intent to conclude a treaty establishing a collective security arrangement in the Far East should be issued by the countries which intend to be treaty members. The JCS .list the provisions which the treaty should incorporate. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 13 August 1954... T19 199. Secretary Wilson expresses the Defense views on the draft "Southeast Asia Collective Security Treaty" which include the JCS position. In his view, the recent developments' in Geneva and Indochina increases the urgency for a "comprehensive United States policy with respect to the Far East region as a whole."

Secretary Dulles replies to the JCS 4 preconditions with the assertion that "one of the most efficient means of enabling the Vietnamese Government to become strong is to . assist it in reorganizing the National army and in train- ing that army." Even though Vietnam could not meet the U.S. prerequisites, Dulles believes that strengthening the army was a prerequisite to political stability.

Ambassador Heath goes on record with a strong criti- cism of General ODaniel's "impetuous action" in contacting General Hinh concerning the political . crisis in Saigon. ODaniel prefers Hinh to Diem and  . rejects the exiling of Hinh to the United States as . requested by Diem. Ambassador Heath Letter to State, 16 September 1954. 753 2O7 The JCS see the Geneva -cease-fire agreement as a major ' obstacle to the introduction of adequate U.S. MAAG personnel and of additional arms and equipment. Further, because of "uncertain capabilities of the French andVietnamese to retrieve, retain, and reorganize the . dispersed forces of Vietnam," U.S. support to the area should be accomplished at "low priority."

The U.S. and France agree to support Diem in the establishment of a strong, anti-Communist nationalist government. The five key elements recognized which can provide a chance of success are Bao Dai, General Hinh and the National army, and the three sects. The Binh Xuyen sect, which controls the police and is tied to Bao Dai, is to .. be isolated from Bao Dai and their strength minimized. TOSEC 9, 30 September 1954. 65 211. Secretary Dulles feels that U.S. policy on the magnitude of force levels and costs for Vietnam should be based on .NSC 54292 which provides for internal security forces under SEATO "it is imperative that the United States Government prepare a firm position on the size ' of forces we consider a minimum level to assure the internal security of Indochina." Dulles Letter to wilson, 11 October 1954... 768 212. Defense forwards Secretary Dulles letter (Document 204, page 746 ) to JCS and requests the JCS to reconsider their previous estimates (Document 202, page 742) in light of the more recent views of Dulles. ISA Memorandum for JCS, 14 October 1954.. 770 213 The JCS, in reply to the Secretary of State's letter of 11 October (Document 210, page 765), persist in their view that the U.S. should not participate in the training of Vietnamese forces. However, if "political considerations are overriding'," then the JCS agree to assignment of a training mission to MAA.G Saigon "with safeguards against French interference" JCS. Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 19 October 1954... 771 214., Dulles reports on a conversation with Mendes-France on the critical situation in Vietnam. The French position is that plans should be laid for another government structure in the event of a Diem failure. They stress the importance of utilizing the "thread of legitimacy deriving from Bao Dai" Dulles requests the State Department estimate on the political situation.  . ' DULTE 5,- 20 October 1954 4 f5 215 A new approach to leadership training and "crossfertilization between Western and Asiatic ideas" is  proposed in a psychological operations concept en- . titled "Militant Liberty." The implement tion of ' "Militant Liberty" a concept which "motivates indigenous people to work toward a common goal of individual freedom" is proposed on a test basis in Indochina as a joint militery-CIA venture. Defense Memo for the CIA (Draft), 20 October 1954XXXV'  T Sensitive- t     '  TOP' SECRET Page 216. The State Departments estimate of the political situation is that Hinh holds a veto power over Diem; "jockeying for power and struggle for cabinet positions is resulting in paralyzing impasse"; French reference to "another structure of government" implies a "hankering to reestablish a political system" which might involve direct colonial-type controls by France; and, unless . Diem receives U.S.-French support, his chances of success appear slight. Paris TEDUL 11 NIACT, 21 October 1954.. 780 . 217.

The OCB draft recommendations on training in Vietnam outline the U.S. role in assisting the reorganization and training of the Vietnamese armed forces and specifies the coordination requiredbetween the Arn-bassador and Chief, MAAG.

Diem is insisting on getting rid of General Hinh. Eisenhowers letter to Diem is being interpreted as superseding washington agreements, that Diem has "full . rein" withoiit meeting the precondition of "forming a strong and stable government." The President's letter can also be exploited by the Viet Minh and is ca.using the French concern. State Memorandum of Conversation, 26 October 1954.. 798 221. Secretary Dulles forwards the main points of General -Collins recommendations regarding force levels in Vietnam. In summary, the points are (1) it would be disastrous if the French Expeditionary Corns (FEC-) were withdrawn prematurely; (2) the U.S. should continue to subsidise the EEC; (3) the Vietnamese Amy should be  . xxxvi      I '  . Page down to 77,000 and under Vietnamese command by July 1955; (4) the U.S. should assume training responsibility by 1 January 1955; and (5) the French are agreeable to a slow build-up of MAAG.

The French Ambassador is informed by the FOA that, sub- . ject to agreement, the U.S. contemplates $100 million support for the FEC in Indochina for CY 1955 The Defense Department has "never agreed to the original position paper," which is based on General Collins recommendations, without details of his calculations. ISA Memorandum for Record, 24 November 1954.. 802 223.- Senator Mansfield states his conclusions based on  General Collins' analysis of the Vietnam situation (1) prospects for Diem "look very dim," elections in 1956 would probably favor the communists; (2) the-U.S. should continue to support Vietnam as long as possible; . (3) he sees no alternative to Diem; (4) he is certain refugees, Catholic bishops and church officials would . oppose replacement of Diem; (5) Paris should urge Bao Dai cease his interference and. support Diera; (6) and Diem should be encouraged to compromise on issues. State Memorandum of Conversation, 7 December 1954... 806 224. The French Government is considering the decision to accelerate withdrawal of the FEC and evacuation of civilians as a direct res'ult of the U.S. decision to provide only one-third the amount requested for maintenance of the FEC in 1955- Paris 2448 to Dulles, 9 December 1954. 809 225. Diem "passes the buck" of convincing the sect leaders ' not to oppose the appointment of Dr. Quat as Defense . Minister to the U.S. Collins is convinced that Diem and his brothers,Luyen and Nhu, are afraid of Quat or any strong man in control of the armed forces since with "spineless General Ty" as Chief of Staff, Diem has effectively seized control of the array. ' ' Further, Collins comments on the alternatives to Diem Government; though the alternative of gradual withdrawal from Vietnam "is least desirable, in all honesty, , and in view of what I have observed here to date it is possible this may be the only sound solution." Collins (Saigon) 2250 to Dulles, 13 December 1954 811 226. The Defense Department reviews the military aid situation in Indochina including the value of MDAP shipments ($1,085 million) and losses of equipment at Dien U xxxvii TOP SEC-LET      ' Bien Phu ($1.2 million) which included 8 tanks, 24 howitzers, and 15,000. small arms. Defense Letter to Senate Foreign Relations Commi ttee, 14 December 1954... 227. Collins is convinced that "Diem does not have the capacity to unify divided factions in Vietnam" and unless decisive action or dramatic leadership galvanizes the country into unified action "this country will be lost to communism. "Apparently, the only Vietnamese who might be competent...is Bao Dai." It is recommended that the U.S. not assume responsibility for training on 1 January 1955, or give direct military aid. Collins 2303 for Dulles, 16 December 1954... , 820 228. Ambassador Heath suggests that General Collins recom-nendations ignore the basic factor that withholding aid ' from Diem would assist a communist takeover. Dulles ' has analyzed our situation in Vietnam as a "time buying operation" and Heath recommends continued support of Diem in spite of a "Bao Dai solution." The fear that $300 million plus our national prestige would be lost in a gamble" is a legitimate one, but withholding our support would "have a fa'r worse effect." Heath Memo- randum to FE, 17 December 1954.. 229. Tripartite discussions on Indochina are summarized. To Secretary Dulles desire to continue strong support of Diem, Ely indicates-that he and Collins have exerted pressure without result and fwere now convinced that it was hopeless to expect anything of Diem." Ely feels that he and Collins must decide now "whether Diem was really the man capable of national union." Four points are agreed upon (1) support Diem, (2) study alternatives, (3) investigate timing of replace..ment, ald (4) (added by Dulles) how much more U.S. investment should be made in Indochina if it is decided theress no good alternative to Diem?

Dulles 2535 to Collins (Saigon), 24 December 1954. 853 Collins refutes most of the comments of Ely and Mendes made at the tripartite discussion and is disturbed over some of the suggestions and attitudes of Mendes and . Eden. He feels that he should be in washington in January if the NSC is to re-evaluate U.S. policy to avoid misunderstandings. Collins 2455 to Dulles, 25 December 1954.. 856 233. Secretary Dulles decides that the U.S. should proceed as scheduled and "take the plunge" and begin direct aid to Vietnam on 1 January and move ahead on MAAG negotiations in Cambodia. Dulles feels that the JCS prerequisite on eliminating the French from Cambodia is "too legalistic and unrealistic."

The JCS provide additional courses of action in Vietnam to the Secretary of Defense. Specifically, (1) to con- . tinue aid; (2) to unilaterally institute an "advisory system"; (3) if (1) and (2) fail, to deploy unilaterally or with SEATO; (4) or to withdraw all U.S. support from South Vietnam and "concentrate on saving the remainder of Southeast Asia." JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 January 1955.. 862 ' 236. General J. Lawton Collins reports on the situation in South Vietnam. The major factors which will affect the outcome of U.S. efforts are (1) Viet Minh strength and intentions; (2) French attitude and-intentions; (3) sects attitudes and intentions; (4) Vietnamese armed forces loyalties; (5) free Vietnam economy, and (6) Diems popular support. There is no guarantee that Vietnam will remain free with U.S. aid but without it, "Vietnam will surely be lost to communism."

The JCS recommend a concept and plans for the implemen- ( tation, if necessary, of Article TV.l., of the Manila Pact (SEACDT). The primary objective is deterrence of "overt aggression by China or other Communist nations." . The concept relies on development of indigenous forces and readiness to retaliate with U.S. power on the aggressor.

Collins 4448 to Dulles, 9 April 1955. 894 242. Diem exists by reason of U.S. support despite French reluctance. If the French view prevails, "removal of Diem... may well be interpreted in Vietnam, and Asia, as an example of U.S..pdying lip service to nationalist cause, and then forsaking a true nationalist leader when colonial interests' put enough pressure on us." Dulles.4438 to Saigon, 9 Apr 55- 907 , .243. Bao Dai recommends that the U.S. agree with the French to create a "Supreme Council" or "Council of Elders" to govern in plape of Diem. The Binh Xuyen could have been used in the common effort if "Diem had not bungled matters." Bao Dai cannot rule for Diem by decree and considers Diem's strength as a "mockery." Paris 4396 to Dulles, 9 Apr 55... 910 244. Ely disagrees with the U.S. on maintaining Diem in office. The worsening situation is attributed to Diem by the French and "only by surgery, that is removal of Diem, can the country be saved." Ely feels that if Diem is retained, he could not be the responsible French representative or remain in.Saigon. Saigon 4661 to Dulles (Excerpts) 19 Apr 55. 912 245. Diem is seen as a barrier to forming an interim government and the gap between him and other elements in the society is becoming wider. The U.S., however, warns . Vietnamese leaders that if Diem is removed as a "sect victory" it would be "difficult to obtain popular support in the U.S. for continuation of U.S. aid." Saigon 4662 to Dulles, 20 Apr 55 915 246. Diem announces to the U.S. his.willingness to accept a coalition in the government but on his terms. This uncompromising attitude leads Collins to remark "I see no alternative to the early replacement of Diem."- Saigon 4663 to Dulles, 20 Apr 55. 918 . Conclusions and recommendations are offered as a basis for future Department of Defense positions on the subject of South Vietnam. Key recommendations made are to determine U.S. military action within the scope of SEACDT to prevent the loss of Southeast Asia as a result of the loss of South Vietnam, and to postpone .indefinitely the elections proposed by Geneva Accords for Vietnam.

Bao Dai registers strong complaints against U.S. support of Diem, U.S.- inaction which allowed the present civil strife, end against U.S. failure to urge Diem to go to France. Diem, in Bao Dai's opinion, is a "psychopath who wishes to martyrize himself." Paris 4y46 to Dulles, 30 April 1955. 948 252. It is predicted that the success of Diem against the Binh Xuyen, Bao Dai, the French and General Vy has created a . potentially revolutionary situation in Vietnam and, given U.S. support and French acquiescence, Diem is expected to stabilize the situation in Saigon. SNIE 63.1-21-55, 2 May 1955... 955 253 Tripartite discussions again reveal basic disagreement.

JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 1 July 1955. 260. In probable developments before July 1956, North Vietnam (DRV), though confronted by serious .economic problems, will consolidate its control north of the 17th parallel. The DRV army has increased in strength but will probably not attack Laos before mid-1956. Tactics are likely to include activation of guerrilla units in South Vietnam and their reinforcement by .infiltration from the North. NIE 63.1-55, 19 July 1955 993 261. The consequences of selected U.S. courses of action are estimated in the event of Viet Minh aggression against South Vietnam, while overt aggression is unlikely, U.S. efforts at undertaking other steps to convince the Viet Minh that aggression will be met with intervention are expected to render overt aggression even less likely. Failure to intervene however, could signal an expanded Communist Chinese effort in Asia.

' XLV       1954       SENSITIVE RM-735 PHO-157 WHY THE UNITED STATES ISSUED A UNILATERAL DECLARATION INSTEAD OF SIGNING THE 1954 ACCORDS ON INDOCHINA Secretary of State Dulles was utterly unwilling to consider signing accords on Indochina of the type concluded at Geneva in 1954. Signing of the Accords, therefore, was never an alternative in his mind, to issuing a unilateral declaration. On the contrary, the unilateral declaration was a substitute, suggested by the desperate French leaders as the most that they could obtain from the United States, for a partial or complete American withdrawal from the Geneva proceedings and for disassociation from the Indochina settlement. To understand the American position at the time of the Accords, it is necessary to trace the evolution of our policy from the time, in 1953, when Dulles reacted negatively to suggestions for negotiations on the Indochina problem. Dulles told the French at that time that negotiations with no other alternative usually ended in capitulation. Then in 1954, after joining reluctantly in the four-power decision to hold the Geneva talks on Indochina, he pressed hard for action to strengthen the western hand--above all, for swift establishment of a coalition to meet the Communist threat in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the United States limited its role in the Indochina talks to that of an "interested" nation, as distinct from the role of a belligerent or of a principal in the negotiations, and it determined to dissociate itself from any disadvantageous solution. The United States battled British inclinations to accept a solution involving the partition of Vietnam and, in the instructions to the American Delegate, Under Secretary waiter Bedell Smith, said that it would approve no armistice or other agreement which would have the effect of "subverting the existing lawful governments ... or of permanently impairing their territorial integrity or of placing in jeopardy the forces of the French Union in Indochina." Beyond this, when the Geneva conferees turned to the discussion of control machinery for an Indochina settlement, Dulles rejected the idea of American participation in a guarantee of the settlement because, as he put it, this would commit the United States to sustaining Communist domination of territory and thus would cut across "our basic principles for dealing with the communist world". (This was presumably a reference to the Republican goal of "liberating" the captive nations of Eastern Europe.)  SENSHM 676       SENSITIVE -2- As the Geneva Conference proceeded, however, Secretary Dulles somewhat eased his opposition to a solution involving partition. As early as June 9 he agreed with Smith that the deteriorating military situation might lead to de facto partition, though he wanted the United States to try to avoid being identified with such a result. Later he told Foreign Secretary Eden that it would be difficult for the United States to guarantee a Communist success in north Vietnam or anywhere else but that it could perhaps acquiesce in a settlement which it disliked but would not upset by force. Accordingly., the United States and Britain informed France in a joint message that they would "respect" an armistice agreement meeting seven specified criteria, including the preservation of "at least the southern half of Vietnam, and if possible an enclave in the Delta". Fearing that a settlement would be reached which did not meet the seven criteria listed in the Anglo-American message, the United States in July contemplated the alternatives of completely withdrawing from the Conference or of participating in lower key and with a lower level of representation (i.e., with Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson as the top American Delegate instead of Under Secretary Smith). Explaining the American position, Dulles told Eden and Mendes-France that the United States could not be put in the position of apparently approving the sale of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into Communist captivity in a settlement which would be portrayed as a second Yalta. At the same time, he said, the United States did not question Frances right to exercise its own judgment and did not wish to put itself in the position of seeming to pass "moral judgment upon French action" or of disassociating itself from the settlement "at a moment and under circumstances which might be unnecessarily dramatic." Mendes-France, however, fervently urged that Dulles or Smith head the American Delegation even at the risk of having to disavow the settlement. All he asked, he said, was that the United States make a unilateral statement that it would take action if the Communists broke a settlement based on the seven points. Dulles felt that such a statement would pose no problem. He agreed to a Franco-American Position Paper, in which the British concurred, incorporating the understanding that if a settlement were reached which the United States could respect, then the United States would express its position "unilaterally or in association only with non-Communist states". It was on the basis of the understandings in the Position Paper that the United States issued its unilateral declaration on July 21, 1954. Attached hereto is an Annex which summarizes the six points in the Franco-American Position Paper. PHPESCostre11e1n 4-14-65  SENSITIVE " 677      Annex G? FOISTS IN FRANCO-M-RECAIE FQ5I2IGH 1A2O1 C?

The United States Ambassador at once reported this opinion to the Department of State and Secretary Dulles immediately replied through the United States Ambassador substantially as follows "As I personally explained to General Ely at a. conference at which Admiral Radford was present, it would not be passible far the United States to become a belligerent in Indochina without a full political understanding with France and Other countries. In addition it would be necessary that Congress should act. I have confirmed this position with the Presidents The Executive is prepared to consider united action in Indochina. However, such action is impossible except on a coalition basis which would, include active participation of British Commonwealth countries, in view of their great stake in Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. 3. On April 23, 1954, during the course of a NATO Ministerial Council meeting in Paris, attended by Secretary of State Dulles, the French Foreign Minister showed Secretary Dulles a military report from Indochina which stated that it might be necessary to seek a cease fire unless there were immediate and massive air support by the United States, which it was thought might still save Dien Bien Phu. The next day, April 24, Secretary Dulles, after consulting on military aspects with Admiral Radford, the United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who .

"The situation with regard to our participation is the same as when I spoke with you on April 14. Under the circumstances, we should first need Congressional authorization for any such war action. This cannot be obtained in a matter of hours, nor do I think it can be obtained at all unless it is within the framework of a political understanding which would include other nations directly and vitally interested in Southeast Asia. "I may add that I have received military advice which indicates that at this stage even a massive air attack will not assure the lifting of the siege of Dien Bien Phu."

At this point, the French Government indicated that it would like to discuss comprehensively with the United States Government the political and military conditions which would enable the United States to intervene militarily in Indochina. The French Government was thereupon promptly advised through the United States Ambassador in Paris (May 11, 1954) that the President would be disposed to ask Congress for authority to use the armed forces of the United States in the area to support friendly and recognized governments against aggression or armed subversion promoted from without, provided certain conditions were met. The conditions then defined were subsequently summarized by Secretary Dulles in his June 11, 1954, address at Los Angeles as follows "(1 ) an invitation from the present lawful authorities; (2) clear i assurances of complete independence to Laos, Cambodia, and Viet-Nam; (3) evidence of concern by the United Nations; (4) a joining in the collective effort of some of the other nations of the area; and (5) assurance that I'ance will not itself withdraw from the battle until it is won." with reference to (5), the precise United States suggestion was th the French Government should not withdraw its forces during the period of the "united action", so that the forces from the United States -- which it ' 1 '   Classification 689 I bl SENSITIVE MM?nC,aSSined PerExecu,ive Order 13526.       .  11 J r i  Page of telegram m Amembassy LONDON- '  '   Classification I was then thought would be principally but not exclusively air and sea forces -and forces frcm Other participating countries, WOuld be supplementary tO, and n6t in substituiOn for, the existing forces in the area. 13.

SECRET ( . POST-GENEVA OUTLOOK IN INDOCHINA THE PROBLEM To assess the probable outlook in Indochina in the light of the agreements reached at the Geneva conference. CONCLUSIONS ( ( 1. The signing of the agreements at Ge-neva has accorded international recognition to Communist military and politicaI power in Indochina and has given that .power a defined geographic base. 1 We believe that the Communists will not give up their objective of securing control of all Indochina but will, withOut violating the armistice to the extent of launching an armed invasion to the south or west, pursue their objective by political, psychological, and paramilitary means. 3. We believe the Communists will consolidate control over North Vietnam with little difficulty. Present indications are that the Viet Minh will pursue a moderate political program, which together with its strong military posture, wilt be calculated tO make that regime appeal to the nation-alist feelings of the Vietnamese popuIa-tion generally. It is possible, however, that the Viet Minh may find it desirable or necessary to adopt a strongly repressive domestic program which would diminish its. appeal in South Vietnam. In any event, from its new territorial base, the Viet Minh will intensify Communist ac-tivities throughout Indochina. V 4- Although it is possible that the French j and Vietnamese, even with firm support from the US and other powers, may be able to establish a strong regime in South Vietnam, we believe that the chances for this development are poor and, moreover, I that the situation is more likely to coni i tinue to deteriorate progressively over the . next year. It is even possible that, at some timenuring the next twO years, the South Vietnam Government could be taken over by elements that would seek uniflcation with the North even at the , expense of Communist domination. If; J, the scheduled national elections are held ; in July 1956, and if the Viet Minh does not t prejudice its political prospects; the Viet , Minh will almost certainly win. 5. The ability of the Laotian Government to retain ccntrol in Laos wilI defend upon developments in South Vietnan. and upon the receipt of French military and other assistance. Even with such assistance, however, Lacs will be faced by a growing Communist threat which might result in the overthrow of the present government through' subversion or elections, and in any case would be greatly intensified if alt SECRET      SECRET n r . Vietnam were to fall under Communist . control. ' .6. We believe that if adequate outside ' assistance is made avaiIable, the Cam- bodtan Government' will probably increase its effectiveness and the effective- ness of its internal security forces and will be able to suppress Communist guerrilla actiyity and to counter Communist political activity. The situation in Cambodia would probably deteriorate, however, if a Communist government should emerge in Loas or South Vietnam. DISCUSSION I. THE CURRENT SITUATION General 7. The signing of the agreements at Geneva has ended large-scale warfare in Indochina and has affirmed the independence of Laos and Cambodia. It has, on the other hand, ' accorded international recognition to Communist military and political power in Indo. china and has given that power a defined geographic base. Finally, the agreements have dealt a blow to the prestige of the Western Powers and particularly of France. North Vietnam 8. The Viet Minh has emerged from Geneva with international recognition ' arid with greatly enhanced power arid prestige in Indo- china. The Viet Minh leaders, while ad- mitting that their ultimate objectives may have been temporarily compromised for the sake of peace, are acclaiming the agreements as denoting'a major victory and ensuring the eventual reunification of all Vietnam under ' Communist aegis. Ho Chi-Minh is generally regarded as the man who liberated Tonkin from 70 years of French rule. The Viet Minh has initiated a program to absorb presently ' French-controlled areas in the Tonkin DeIta. South Vietnam 9. In South Vietnam, the agreements and the fact of the imposed partition have engendered an atmosphere of frustration and disillusionment, which has been compounded by widespread uncertainty as to French and US in- tentions. The present political leadership   appears to retain the passive support of the  . more important nationalist organizations and individuals. However, the governments already weak administrative base has been further dislocated, and it has only uncertain assurances of continued outside military and financial support. Mutual jealousies and a lack of a single policy continue to divide Vietnamese politicians. Moreover, certain proFrench elements are seeking the overthrow of the Dier?. government vith the apparent support of French colonial interests anxious to retain their control. 10. The North Vietnam population is somewhat greater than the South Vietnam population and, in any event, the loss of the Tonkin Delta has deprived South Vietnam of the most energetic and nationalist segment of the population. Although South Vietnam has the capability for agricultural sclf-sufficiency, the principal industrial establishments and fuel and mineral resources are located in North Vietnam. 11. Provided that the terms of the ceasefire agreement are observed, the combined French-Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam now have the capability of maintaining internal security. Laos  . 12. The relatively stable internal situation in Laos, which in the past has depended upon French support, remains essentially unchanged. The Laotian Army is poorly armed and trained and, without the support of French forces and advisers, does not have the capability to maintain internal security. Moreover, Pathct Lao Communists continue to have de facto control of two northern SECRET 03      SECRET provinces adjoining the Communist-con, trolled areas of Northern Victnam. Furthermore, the Geneva agreements give members of the Pathet Lao movement freedom of political action throughout Laos. Cambodia 13. The internal Cambodian situation, except for sharp political rivalries among Icad- ing Cambodians, is at present relatively stable. Non-Communist dissidcnce appears to have abated and the principal dissident leader, Son Ngoc Thanh, no longer poses any real threat to thc government. The King retains widespread popular support for having obtained a large degree of effective independence from the French and for having safeguarded Cambodias integrity at Geneva. Although the Communists are permitted freedom of political action in Cambodia, they have only a minimum appeal. The Cambodian forces, although somewhat weakened by the withdrawal of French forces, have the capability of dcaling with current Communist subversive action. II. OUTLOOK IN INDOCHINA General Considerations 14. The Geneva agreements, although precise and detailed concerning the time and place of troop redeployments and related matters, are imprecise about matters pertaining to  future military aid and training. Moreover, the agreements are vague with respect to political matters. Details on the implementation of national elections are left for the interested parties to determine. Except for such influence as may be exerted by the pres- ence of supervisory teams front India, Canada, and Poland, there is no provision for forcing thc parties concerned to implement or adhere to the agreements. 15. The course of future developments will be determincd loss by the Geneva agreements than by the relative capabilities and actions of thc Communist and non-Communist en-' titles in Indochina, and of interested outside powers. 16. Communist policy. Communist willingness to reach agreement for an armistice in j Indochina, at a timc when prolongation of the j conflict coyld have produced a steadily dctc-1 riorating situation in Indochina, was probably dcrivcd in substantial part from the Commu-. nist estimate that (a) an effort to win a total military victory in Indochina might precipitate US military intervention, and (b) the objective of gaining political control ovcr all Indochina could bc achieved as a result of the armistice agreement. The Communists also 4 apparently believed that an attitude of reasonableness and the acceptance of an armistice in Indochina would contribute to the realization of their objective to undermine western efforts to develop an effective military coalition. They probably consider, therefore, that a deliberate resumption of large-scale military operations from their zone in the north would negate the political and psychological advantages the Communists have gained by negotiating a settlemcnt and could involve grave risk of expanded war. 17. In the light of these consideFations, we bclieve .that the broad outlines of Communist policy in Indochina will be to (a) refrain from deliberately taking major military action to break the armistice agreemcnt while secking to gain every advantage in the implementation of the agreements; (b) consolidate the Communist political, military, and economic position in North Vietnam; (c) conduct intensive political warfare against non-Commu-nist Indochinese governments and people; (d) work for the uItimate removal of all Western influence, particularly French and US, from Indochina; and (e) emphasize and exploit issues in Indochina which will create and intensify divisions among non-Commu-nist countries. In sum, we believe that the Communists will not give up their objective ofsecuring control of all Indochina but will, without violating thc armistice to the extent of launching an armcd invasion to the south or west, pursue their objective by political, psychological, and paramilitary means. 18. French policy. It is impossibIe at this time to predict even the broad outlines of French policy in Indochina. The following . appear to be the main alternatives t  SECRET 691 .     SECRET c.

We believe that the French might be persuaded to adopt this policy by strong US-UK pressure, together with economic and military assistance to France and a guarantee of the defense' of the free areas of Indochina against further Com-munist military attack. b. Continuation of French Union ties with thc non-Communist Indochinese states, with indirect French poIitical controls and French economic domination. We believe that French policy may proceed along these Hnes if the French estimate that (1) the Communists will follow a conciliatory policy in Indochina; (2) the non-Communist leadership will ofTer very little difficulty; and (3) the US and UK will not exert pressure toward a grant of full independence to the Indochinese states. c. Some form of agreement with thc Viet Minh providing for expediting elections and achieving a unification of Vietnam. The French might be inclined to follow this line if the Viet Minh held out promises of the main-tenance of French economic and cultural in-terests, and of the continuance of some form of association of the unified Vietnamese state with France. d. Withdrawal of all French military, administrative, and economic support from In-, dochina. We believe that this would occur only in the event of a hopeless deterioration of political, military, and economic conditions in the area. 19. International policies. The political survival of the Indochiribse states is endangered not only by the threat of external Communist attack and internal Communist subversion, but also by their own inherent inexperience, immaturity, and weakness. We believe that without outside support the Indochinese states cannot become strong enough to with-stand Communist pressures. The course of developments in Indochina will be largely influenced by thc attitudes and policies of other powers. In general, we believe that in tb,e absence of firm support from the US, the non- Communist states of Indochina cannot long remain non-Communist. If they are given opportunity, guidance, and material help in building national states, they may be ablc to attain viability. We believe that the energy and resourcefulness necessary for this achicve-ment will not arise spontaneously among the non-Communist Indochinese but will have to be sponsored and nurtured from without. OutIook in Vietnam 20. Outlook in North Vietnam. Communist activities in North Vietnam will be concen-trated upon consolidation of Communist con-trol, with their efforts in this respect probably appearing moderate at the outset. The Viet Minh will probably emphasize social and eco-nomic reforms and the participation of all political, economic, and religious groups in state activity. At the same time, Viet Minh cadres will establish themsclvcs throughout the Delta, will begin the process of neutraliz-ing all effective opposition groups,'will under-take the usual Communist program of popular indoctrination, and will prepare for the elec-tion scheduled in July 1956. We believe the Communists will be able to achievc the consolidation of North Vietnam with little difficulty. 21. We believe that the Viet Minh will con-tinue to develop their armed forces. Although the armistice provisions forbid the Viet Minh from increasing their supply of arms, we bc-lieve they will covertly strengthen and possi-bly expand their armed forces with Chinese Communist aid. Viet Minh forcci will almost certainly continue to receive training in China. 22. Thus established firmly in North Vietnam, the Viet Minh regime will probal j retain and may increase its symbolic attraction as thc base of Vietnamese national indcpendence. Its methods of consolidating control will prob-ably continue for some time to be moderate, and, its internal program together with its military power, will be calculated to make the regime attractive to the remaining peoples of Indochina. It is possible, however, that the Viet Minh may fmd it desirable or necessary ; SECRET . t 6S5 .     SECRET to adopt a strongly repressive domestic program which would prejudice its psychological appeal and political prospects. Barring such repressive Viet Minh policies, the unification issue will continue to be exploited to Communist advantage- throughout Vietnam. Meanwhile, the Viet Minh regime will con-tinue to strengthen the Communist underground apparatus in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, aware that significant Communist gains in any onc of these countries will strengthen thc Communist movement in the others. It will seek to develop strong overt Communist political groups where possible and will generally use all available means towards the eventual unification of the country under Communist control. ' 23. Outlook in South Vietnam. We believe that the Viet Minh will seek to retain sizeable military and political asscts in South Vietnam. .Although the agreements provide for the re-moval to the north of all Viet Minh forces,, many of the regular and irregular Viet Minh soldiers now in the south are natives of the area, and large numbers of them will probably t cache their arms and remain in South Viet-inam. In addition, Viet Minh administrative 'cadres have been in firm control of several .large areas in central and south .Vietnam for jseveral years. These cadres will probably reImain in place. French and Vietnamese efforts 'to deal with stay-behind military and administrative units and personnel will be greatly hampered by armistice provisions guaran- teeing the security of pre-armistice dissidents from reprisals. 24. The severe problem, of establishing and maintaining security in South Vietnam will probably be increased by certain provisions of the Geneva agreements which prohibit the import of arms and military equipment, except as replacements, and the introduction of additional foreign miIitary personnel, the establishment of new military bases; and xnili-tary alliances. These provisions limit the de-'velopment of a Vietnamese nationaI army to such numbers as may be equipped by stocks evacuated from Tonkin, plus stocks now held in Saigon. However, in the last analysis, Vietnamese security will be determincd by the degree of French protection and assistance in the development of a national army, the cn-ergy with which the Victnamese themselves attack the problem, and by the will of the nonCommunist powers to provide South Vietnam with effective guarantees. 25. In addition to the activities of stay-behind military and administrative groups, the Viet Minh will make a major effort to discrcdit any South Vietnam administration, and to exaccrbate French-Vietnamese relations, and appeal to the feeling for national unification which will almost certainly continue strong among the South Vietnamese population. The Communist goal will be to cause the collapse of any non-Communist efforts to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam, and thus to leave North Vietnam thc only visible foundation on which to re-establish Vietnamese unity. French and anti-Communist Vietnamese efforts to counter the Viet Minh unity appeal and Communist subversive activities will be complicated at the outset by the strong resentment of Vietnamese nationalists over the partitioning of Vietnam and the abandoning of Tonkin to Communist control. It may be difficult to convince many Vietnamese troops, political leaders, and administrative pcrsonneI in Tonkin to go south, let alone to assist actively in the development of an effective administration in South Vietnam. 26. Developments in South Vietnam will also depend in large part on French courses of action. Prospects for stability in South Vietnam would be considerably enhanced if the French acted swiftly to insure Vietnam full independence and to encourage strong nationalist leadership. If this were done, anti-French nationalist activity might be lessened. With French military , and economic assistance backed by US aid the Vietnamese could proceed to develop gradually an cfTective security force, local government organization, and a long-range program for economic and social reform. Nevertheless, it will be very difficult for the French to furnish the degree of assistance which will be required without at the same time reviving anti-French feeling to thc point of endangering the whole effort. SECRET 6S6 .     SECRET <27 On the basis of the evidence we have at this early date, however, we believe that a favorable development of the situation in j South Vietnam is unlikely. Unless Mende's- France is able to overcome the force of French traditional interests and emotions which have I in the past governed the implementation of 1 policy in Indochina, we do not believe there will be the dramatic transformation in French i policy necessary to win the active loyalty and ; support of the local population for a South  Vietnam Government At the present time, -t appears more likely that the situation will V deteriorate in South Vietnam and that the arrangement proved impossible, and the situ-aticn deteriorated to the point of hopelessness, would the French withdraw completely from the country. Outlook in Laos withdrawal from Tonkin inations, distrust, and There will be delays in effective administration will involve recrim-possibly violence, the development of in the south; the French military will probably be forced to re- tain a large measure of control for reasons of security; and efforts by French colonial . interests to develop a puppet Cochin-China state will persist. It is even possible that at some point, during the next two years the South Vietnam Government could be taken over by elements that would seck unification with the Viet Minh in the North even at the expense of Communist domination. Even-if I "If the scheduled national elections are ! held in July 1956, and if the Viet Minh I does not prejudice its political prospec the Viet Minh will almost certainly win. t 23. In the interim, Viet Minh propaganda will find ample opportunities to influence Vietnamese attitudes. Within a year, Viet Minh I stay-behind units will probably be active polit- ically, and possibly involved in open guerrilla . fighting. In these circumstances, the French will probably be able to maintain their "pres-ence in South Vietnam through mid-l956, but their influence will probably become in' creasingly restricted to major cities and the perimeters of military installations and bases. Thc French might be willing to resolve this situation by an arrangement with the Communists which seemed to offer a chance of saving sonic remnant of the French economic and cultural position in Victnam. Such an arrangcmcnt might include an agreement to hold early elections, even with thc virtual certainty of Viet Minh victory. Only if such an 29. Providing the French maintain the 5,000 troops in Laos which the Geneva agreements permit them, and continue to develop the ' Laotian forccs, the Royal Laotian Government should be able to improve its security forces and, excluding the two northern provinces, to deal, with isolated, small-scale Communist guerrilla actions. Also, providing the Laotians continue to receive French and US technical and financial assistance, they probably will be able to maintain an adequate government administration. Thcre is nothing- in the Geneva agreements to prevent Laos from becoming a member of a defense arrangement so long as no foreign troops other than specified French personnel are based in Laos. 30. However, if thc French for any reason decide not to maintain their troops nor to continue military training in Laos, it will be impossible for the non-Communist powers to orovide effective aid to the Laotians without aching the Geneva agreement. At the re time, Laos will be faced with a growing ts,nmunist threat, and thc freedom of politi-" action permitted members of the Pathet Lao movement, strengthened by support from the Viet Minh, may result in the overthrow of the present government through subversion or elections. Finally, further successes for the Viet Minh in Vietnam will have an immediate adverse effect on the situation in Laos. Outlook in Cambodia 31. We believe that the Communists, in withdrawing organized units from Cambodia, will leave behind organizers, guerrilla leadcrs, and weapons. Initially, the Communists will probably minimize guerrilla action in order to concentrate on building their political potential in Cambodia. 32. Providing the withdrawal of thc Communists is substantially in accord with the agrce- SEC RET. t .     SECRET mcnt, the development of stability in Cambodia during the next year or so will depend largely on two interrelated factors (a) the ability of the Cambodians to develop effective government and internal security forces; and (b) the ability of the Cambodians to obtain external technical and financial assistance. There is no prohibition in the Geneva agreements against Cambodias obtaining outside assistance to develop its defense forces or on joining a defensive alliance, providing the latter is in consonance with the UN Charter and that no foreign troops are based in Cambodia in thc absence of a threat to Cambodian se curity. If adequate outside assistance is made available, the Cambodians will probably increase the effectiveness both of their gov-ernntent and their internal security forces, and will be able to suppress Communist gucr-rilla activity and to counter Communist political activity. The efforts of the Cambodians to strengthen their position would probably be more energetic if their indcpendence were guaranteed by some regional defense arrangement. The situation in Cambodia would deteriorate gravely, however, if a Communist government should emerge in Laos or South Vietnam. t  . SECRET .

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF washington 25, D.C. 4 August 1954 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject U.S. Assumption of Training Responsibilities in Indochina 1. It has been recommended by the Chief MAAG Indochina that the United States assume responsibility for the training of the Vietnamese Army. There are indications that both the Vietnamese and the Cambodian governments may request that the United States assume responsibility for . training their forces as part of any U.S. effort to check further expansion of Communist influence in Indochina. 2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered this  question and recommend that before the United States assumes responsibility for training the forces of any of the Associated States certain preconditions which are essentia.! to the success of-this effort be met. They include the following a. From the military point ofview it is absolutely essential that there be a reasonably strong, stable civil government in control. It is hopeless to expect a U.S. military training mission to achieve success unless the nation concerned is able effectively to perform those governmental functions essential to the successful raising and maintenance of armed forces, to include the provision of adequate facilities, drafting and processing of personnel, pay of troops, etc. Unless the foregoing conditions prevail, a U.S. training mission would lack the authority and governmental support essential to the successful accomplishment of its mission. b. The government of each of the Associated States concerned should formally request that the United States assume responsibility for training their forces and providing the military equipment, financial assistance, and political advice necessary to insure internal stability.c. Arrangements should be made with the French grant-  ing full independence to the Associated States and pro- . p ) viding for the phased, orderly withdrawal of French r.A 7m OrnjMHVL " MM?S,SS,Ted PCr Executive Order 13526    .

( t I 11 August 1954 k el . v MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Review of U.S. Policy in the Far EastNSC 5429 1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff submit herewith their views with respect to a draft statement of policy prepared by the National Security Council Planning Board titled "Review of U.S. Policy in the Far East" (NSC 5429), which is scheduled for consideration by the National Security Council at its meeting on 12 August 1954. 2. In their memorandum for you dated 9 April 1954, subject "U.S. Strategy for Developing a Position of Military Strength in the Far East (NSC Action No. 1O29-b)", the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that the United States formulate a comprehensive policy in which the Far East is viewed as a strategic entity and which would provide definitive direction for the development of a position of military strength in the Far East. NSC 5429 lacks a statement of United States objectives with respect to the area as a whole and broad courses of action for the achievement of such objectives, and hence does not constitute a comprehensive statement of policy as envisaged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 3. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that NSC 5429 be returned to the Planning Board with appropriate guidance for derivation and exposition of U.S. objectives in the Far East and delineation of broad courses of action directed toward their attainment. 4. Specific canments of the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force and the Commandant of the Marine Corps on the material included in NSC 5429 follow "a. we concur in the view of the Defense, JCS, and OEM Members of the Planning Board, contained in the footnote on page 3 of the draft, that U.S. policy with regard to China should be considered and determined first, and that the policy with regard to the peripheral areas should be established in light of this determination. sen$!W 709      I'npVLT'PtI i UI OLviXL. ? we recommend, therefore, that when NSC 5429 is prepared SEi ! J i lVC. in final form, Section IV, COMMUNIST CHINA, be brought forward and redesignated Section I. However, for convenient reference, we have addressed our comments to the sections of the paper in their present order. "b. The following detailed comments are addressed to the bracketed phrases and alternative courses of action set forth in the draft statement of policy, as well as to- amendments and additions which are deemed desirable. (Changes are indicated in the usual manner.) "(1) Page 3, subparagraph 1 c and page 4, paragraph 5. No preference is expressed with respect to including or omitting the bracketed phraseology. "(2) Page 5, subparagraph 7 a. Alternative A is favored. REASON It is considered that the treaty should provide for the prompt and positive application of retaliatory measures against Communist China if it is determined that Communist China is a source of armed aggression, either direct or indirect. Any more limited provision would not constitute an adequate response to the aggression. ' "(3) Page 6, paragraph 8. Alternative B is considered preferable. "(4) Page 7, subparagraph 9 f Amend to read as follows 'f. Continue to exploit opportunities to further U.S.long-range objectives toward uniting Vietnam under a democratic form of government.' "(5) Page 7, subparagraph 9 g. Delete both alternatives. REASON In light of subparagraph 9 f, a. further statelhent on this subject is considered unnecessary. "(6) Page 8, subparagraph 10 d. Stationing of token forces in or around Thailand is not favored. Accordingly it is recommended that Alternative B be rejected. While there is no objection to Alternative A, the necessity for its inclusion in a'statement of policy with respect to Thailand is not apparent, since the visits of United States forces to friendly countries is a routine and well-established custom. "(7) Pages 9 through 11, paragraphs 12, 13, 14, and 15. Among the four statements of alternative courses of action with respect to Communist China adoption of Alternative C (paragraph 14), amended to read as follows, is favored no SENSITIVE TOP orpon > V t O Lv 5  L> !       14. Reduce the relative power of Communist China v Ajl ; ; ' in Asia even at the risk of, but without deliberately provoking, war 'a. (1) React with force, if necessary and advantageous, to expansion and subversion recognizable as such, supported and supplied by Communist China. '(2) React, with immediate, positive, armed force against any belligerent move by Communist China. b Increase efforts to develop the political, economic and military strength of non-Communist Asian countries, including the progressive development of the military strength of Japan, to the point where she can provide for her own national defense and, in time, contribute to the collective defense of the Far East. 'c, d, and e. Same as 13 c, d, and e.' REASONS (1) Alternatives A and B would provide that the United States resort to armed action only in the event that Communist China itself committed armed aggression. Such a policy would be inadequate to cope with indirect aggression which experience indicates will be the most probable form of Chinese Communist aggression in the general area of Southeast Asia in the near future. It should be the objective of United States policy to block the further expansion of Communist China regardless of the methods by which such expansion is attempted. (2) The proposed policy contained in Alternative D is considered to be extreme. It could hardly be expected that such a policy would receive the support of our major Allies. If adopted, it would require that the United States, in common prudence, now embark upon a major expansion of military forces, and take such other steps as are necessary to place <the United States in a position to conduct large-scale military actions in the Far East. In short, the proposed policy is considered to be provocative and one which inherently would greatly increase the risk of general war. (3) The objective set forth in Alternative C, as amended above, is consistent with previously expressed views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It states a definite goal and provides for a positive approach to the problem of reducing "  SENSITIVE !      the threat of further Chinese Communist expansion in Asia. It would provide the basis for action against indirect aggression which is lacking in both Alternatives A and B, while avoiding the more extreme measures, with their greatly enhanced risks, contained in Alternative D. within the content of broader policies with respect to the worldwide threat of Soviet Communism, the steady and consistent application of the courses of action set forth in this alternative hold promise of achieving results advantageous to the security position of the Free world." 5. The comments of the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army on NSC 5429 f oLIow "a. NSC 5429 addresses itself specifically to only the most fundamental aspects of the problem in the Far East, namely the off-shore island chain; general political and economic measures in the Far East; negotiation of a Southeast Asia security treaty; action in the event of local subversion; policy with respect to Indochina, Thailand, Indonesia and Communist China. It is not a comprehensive review of the entire problem. "b. Moreover, the problem confronting us in the Far East cannot be stated, except in relation to and as an element in a United States foreign policy of global scope. "c. while I do not suggest just what such global policy should be, it seems axiomatic to me that one principal OBJECTIVE therein should be to split Communist China from . the Soviet Bloc. Quite aside from the great moral issue involved in the deliberate precipitation of general war the converse of this thesis is equally applicable. From the purely military point of view we must not, by our own act, deliberately provoke war against the combined power of the Soviet Bloc and Communist China, since to do so would be to choose a war against the most potentially powerful enemy coali tion with a strong probability of losing the active support of some of our present Allies. This situation would have the most dangerous possible military consequences, we may well find ourselves in such a war, but it should NOT be our choice without having FIRST, taken every feasible step to increase our readiness to meet an explosion into general war, and SECOND, having mapped out and begun an approach to the OBJECTIVE stated above. 712      d.

' ' For the Joint Chiefs of Staffs .     THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF f I  WASHINGTON 25. D. C. " . 12 August 1954 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Message to the French Prime Minister 1. This memorandum is in response to the memorandum from .the Assistant Secretary of Defence (ISA), dated 11 August 1954, which requested the continents and recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to a Department of State draft of a proponed message to the Prime Minister of France regarding United States policy toward Indochina. 2. In their memorandum to you dated 4 August 1954, subject "U.S. Assumption of Training Responsibilities in Indochina", the Joint Chiefs of- Staff set forth certain conditions which they considered, should be met before the United-States assumes responsibility for training the forces of the Associated-States. Particularly pertinent to the consideration of the proponed message arc two preconditions which, in substance, prescribed a. The existence of a reasonably strong, stable government capable of performing those functins essential to the successful raining and maintenance of its armed forces; and b. The granting by France of full independence to the Associated States and arrangements for the eventual phased Withdrawal of French forces, officials and advisers from Indochina, in order to prowide motivation and a sound basis for thc establishment of national armed forces. 6 3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that neither of the above conditions can be said to exist now. The tenure of the present goVernment in Vietnam appears to be in doubt and ject to final determination by thc French as to the eventual composition of that government. Until this matter has been definitely resolved, thc strength and ntab.i.lity of the Vietnam Government will hardly be uch as to hold promise of provlding the firm I 1 CCrZ of.. KN t L .   NND 633 16.  Q <3 direction required for the raising and maintenance of armed Screen. UnJess a reasonably stable government is established, the United States training mlason would lack authority and governmental support essential to the successful accomplishment of its mission. 4. vltile the French GoVeiTiment haq announced i ts intention to grant, lndcpendeuce to the Associated States, it hue not announced a plan for the Scheduled relinquishment of French authority or for the withdrawal of French officials from Indochina affairs. The residual responsi-bility and authority, if any, to be retained by the French Government, particularly with respect to the control to be exercised oyer the at-med forces of the Associated Stat has not yet been made clear. If, in fact, the French wer to retain a degree of authority and direction in the organization and training of the indigenous forces, the United States training mission would be prevented from discharging its responsibilities' completely independent of French participation and control. 5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the proposed message is not an unqualified commitment to furnish military aid or to provide training assistance to the . Associated States. They are inaccord with the stated purpose of the message, to reassure both the French and Associated States Governments of the United States intention to assist in preventing an eventual Communist take-over in Indochina. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that trie proposed message should state in clearer terms that the final United States decision as to the extent'- of military aid and the assumption of responsibility for training will be contingent upon the establishment of the prerequisite conditions discussed in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 above. As presently worded the proposed message might conwey to the French that U.S. decisions with respect to these matters have already been taken, without definite French comniitmcnts as to their intentions. Further, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that the message should- be more specific with regard to the United States desire that its representatives deal directly with the GoVernments of the Associated States and that all United States military material aid should eventually be glVen directly to the Associated States rather than through the French Government. o.

In response to your memorandum dated 22 July 1954, subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit herewith their Vicwr,, in the light of the new situation created by the recent developments in Indochina, concerning the proposed negotiation of a. regional collective security treaty for the Far East. In addition to thc report of the Joint UK-US Study Group on Southeast Asia and the Draft Treaty submitted by the U.S. member of the Study Group, consideration has been given to thc documents furnished by mernovandumn by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA) dated 23 July 1954 and 2 August 1954, both on the subject "Southeast Asian Collective Defense. Organization.".Sf7m  ok-, f.A t.' So 7 2. Reference is mode to the previously expressed Views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with respect to the Far East region, as set forth in their memorandum for you dated 9 April 1954, subject "United States Strategy for Developing a Position of Military Strength in the Far East (NSC Action IIo. l029-b)." In that memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stressed the need for a comprehensive policy for the Far East which would view that region as 3. strategic entity and which would provide definitive direction for the dc-valopment of a position of military strength in that region. Cognizance was taken of the fact that, in their aggregate, current policies addressed to Individual countrion or segments of the general are make it clear that the United States,-from the standpoint of its security interests, attaches major importance to the Far East area and would be prepared to react with military force against an armed aggression by the USSR or Communist China in that.veg Lon. M . 3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed the opinion that our Far Eastern policy should be directed toward nchiwitig the fo1low ing objectives      Li L. "a. Do velon;- of the purpose and capability of the non-Coirnunist countt- u3 of tho Far to act collec Lively and effectively in o posing the threat of aggressive Communism. "b. Eventual establishment of a comprehcnsiVC regional security advangemont among thc non-Communist countries of the Far East, with which the United States, thc United .Kingdom, and possibly Franca, would be associated. "c. Reduction of the power and influence of the USSR in the . 'Far East,, initially through the containment and reduction of thc relative power position of Communist China, and ultimately the detachment of China from the area of Soviet Communist control . " 4. In proposing courses of action for the accomplishment of these objectives, thc Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that the United States (a) be prepared to preVent further territorial expansion by the Chinese Communists,, (b) retain freedom of action to apply counteraction, as appropriate, against the source of .any aggression, and (c) foster a system of treaties which would lead eventually to a comprehensive and cohesive security arrangement in the Far East area.' 5. At the time these views were expressed, France was maintaining a position of considerable military strength in Indochina, and the Associated States were counted among those countries which could maRe'a substantial contribution to the aggregate of non-Communist military strength in the general area. As the result of the Geneva agreement, the military position of France and thc .Associated States is considerably altered. There is some evidence that France intends to with draw the bulk of her ground forces from Indochin?., leaving, behind only a token force to conduct training of thc armies of the Associated States. It is now unlikely that the previously anticipated military potential of the Associated . tales can be realized Additionally, the Communists have now gained a psychologicri and military victory of far-reaching effect, have substantially augmented their manpower, have acquire important new food resources, and have expanded the territory under their military control. These altered conditions do" not change the basic objectives which our security interests require that we seek in the Far East, but they do have a considerable inEiucnce upon the measures required for the achievement of those objectives   By NWD Date 201 1 6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that the recent developments 1 ri Geneva and Indochina, considered in conJunction with the gUiiornl retro.'rodu trend within the Western oloc, serv to iucrense the ur-micy of the- need for a compvohLiisive Ur lt. d Ska .n policy with renneot to the Far East region ns n de, in order to give dlvectlon, cohesiveness, and greater efrectivvness to the political and military actions which must mow be taken to prevent the loss of the remainder of Southeast Asia to Communist control. It is considered that until the United States formulatea and adopts such an over-all policy we shall be seyerely handicapped in any nerotLattens for the establishment of a collective defense .in the genevpl arsa of Southoast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. Before the provisions of an acceptable security treaty can be finally drafted, it would appear necesoary that certain basic decisions be made with respect to how far the Uni ted States is willing to go, in concert with all or certain of the non-Communist nations having interests in thc Far East or, if necessary, unilaterally, in opposing further Communist accretions in the area under consideration. 7. Similarly, basic decisions Would appear to be requisite to thc adoption of interim courses of action designed to check the momentum created by recent Communist successor., and to provide for coordinated action pending the formalization of a collective security arrangement for the Far Eaut region. 8. Viewing-the immediate problem of treaty negotiations Within this context, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that the United States was pat Holy commit ted to the sponsoring and support of a collective security arrangement for Southeast Asia even before the collapse cf the French effort in ludochinn, but they have serious misgivings cot teeming the military proVisio'ns of such a pact lest they imply commitments which the United Stades would not be able to meet. Failure to satisfy the expoetautens cf the signatories in the matter of military aid could, in turn, result in the alienation of friendly governments rather tri an the acquisition of new allies. "W 9. Subject to tlu? comments set forth below, some of which are made by way of emphasis of ooints in the reports of the UK-US , Study Group, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are in general agreement with the position taken by the United States side of the Croup. The real evaluation of the product of the Study Group will, of course, depend upon the manuer in which the differences in the United States and United Kingdom positions are resolved    10. It is the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a Southeast Asia defense treaty should incorporate provisions responsive to the following considerations having military aspects. , a. The clear purpose of the treaty should be to form a collective security arrangement to deter and, if possible, prevent any further extension of Communist control, by whatever means, within the general area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. b. The initial membership should be limited to those nations willing to join in the type of organization which can be effective in accomplishing the purpose set forth in a above. c. The treaty should provide for the future accession of other powers having interests in the Far East which may subsequently desire to join. (It is considered that the pact should ultimately include Japan, Korea, and possibly Nationalist China.) d. There should be no built-in power of veto. The treaty provisions should permit concerted action by a lesser number than the total of the signatory nations in the event that the political or territorial integrity of any signatory is threatened by Communist aggression in any form. e. Careful consideration should be given to the practicability and desirability of providing voting machinery in the governing council which would preclude the possibility that, at some time in the future when the membership is expanded, a bloc of "neutrals" or a British Commonwealth bloc could exercise a controlling voice. f. The treaty should establish the moral justification and provide the political framework and necessary machinery within which and by which any act of overt Communist aggression could be met by prompt military counteraction, not excluding military action against the real source of the aggression. 722      g. Paragraph 2, Article III, of the Diaft Security Treaty is addiouncd to indirect aggression, the most likely and iDSidtuus form of Communist aggro-sr ion. The treaty shnuld specifically provide tltat any further extension oI Cum i tniut control through infiltration or subVersion, or through any other indircct mtanO, Should as in the case of ovevt aggression, be met by prompt and appropriate counteraction. h. lt should bo made clear in thc preliminary negotiations and in the proVisions of the treaty itself that no ccminltiite'it by tho United States to support the raising, equipping, arid maintenance of indigenous forces andor to deploy United Staten forces in such strengths as to provide for an effect!VC defense of all of the national territory of each sightltory is implied or intended. Military a.td by the United Stated to the Southeast Aslan countries who are members of the pact should be limited to that necessary to permit the countries concerned to raise, equip, and maintain military forces as necessary to insure internal stability, to contribute toward $ reasonably effect!Ve opposition to any attempted inVasion, and to instill national confidence. ' i. It should be made equally clear that the treaty would net commit the United States to a large-scale program of economic aid to the signatory countries in lieu of military aid 'since, in the final analysis, funds for economic aid must come from the total amount of money available for the national Security orogreuas of the United States. 11. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in the view that, .having in mind the length of time required for a treaty to be negotiated arid ratJ.L'iett, tin interim statement of intent to conclude a treaty establishing a collectlve security arrangement in the Far East should be issued jointly by those countrics which intend to .become founder members of such a treaty. Thc draft statement of intenb furnished to the f 'int Chiefs of Staff for comment by the meiitorandum by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA) dated 2 August 1954, J.s considered to be sutisfcctory from the Military point o.C view, lt is suggested, howeyer, that it would bo prudent to withhold any formal declaration of intent until substantial agreement has been retched with the United Kingdom as to thc principal provisions of a treaty723      12. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in the opinion that the security treaty itself should be drafted by a working group representing all of the probable initial signatories. Subject to the comments contained hereinbefore, the informal and unofficial first United States draft, furnished by your memorandum for the Joint -Chiefs of Staff dated 22 July 1954, is considered to be satisfactory as a point of departure. However, several of the technical points raised by the United K mgdom side of the Study Group appear to merit favorable consideration. 13. It would appear desirable to keep the Japanese Government advised as to the progress of treaty negotiations. 14. It is recommended that the foregoing views be given due consideration in the formulation of the Department of Defense position in connection with further negotiations concerning a collective security organization for the general area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. 15. It is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff be afforded additional opportunities, as appropriate, to submit comments concerning the draft treaty in the course of its developmentFor the Joint Chiefs of Staff '  y A M. B. RIDGWAY, General, United States Army, Chief of Staff. 724 I SENSITIVE      Aug 17 1954 Dear Mr. Secretary I refer to the Draft Southeast Asia Collective Security Treaty, copies of which were made available to the Department of Defense by the Department of State. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have expressed their views on the draft submitted by the United States member of the Joint US-UK Study Group on Indochina. The comments of the Department of Defense are made in light of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in consideration of a revised version of the draft Treaty contained in SFAP U-21, dated 5 August 1954. The Department of Defense considers that the revised draft Treaty is generally satisfactory subject to the following comments a. In order to strengthen provisions of the Treaty which permit protection to be extended to countries of the area not participating in the Treaty, the word "general" before "area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific" should be added in paragraph four of the preamble as well as in paragraph one of Article IV. b. The Department of Defense believes that in further negotiations, both preliminary and at the time of the meeting of the Ministers, it should be made clear that no commitments by the United States to support the raising, equipping, and maintenance of indi- . genous forces andor to deploy United States forces in such strengths as to provide for an effective defense of all of the national territory of each signatory is implied or intended. Military aid by the United States to the Southeast Asian countries who are members of the pact would be limited to that necessary to permit the countries concerned to raise, equip, and maintain military forces as necessary to insure internal stability, to provide a reasonably effective opposition to any attempted invasions, and to instill national confidence. This is consistent with the views expressed at our meeting on 24 July 1954, and in your message No. 589 to London dated 29 July 1954. c. It-, should equally be made clear that the treaty would not commit the United States to a large-scale program of economic aid to the signatory countries in lieu of military aid since, in he . 'final analysis, funds for economic aid must come from the total amount of money available for the national security programs of the United States. SecDef Cont. No. TS-O194      e WPU C JI J .1 J . d. It is the view of the Department of Defense that if the Treaty is ultimately to result in the development of effective collective strength to halt further Communist control in the general area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific, those nations in the area which are potentially capable of-making a substantial military contribution, i.e., Japan, Korea, and possibly Nationalist China, should eventually be permitted to subscribe to the Treaty if they so desire. Accordingly, this point should be made clear to the other signatories in the negotiations leading to the signing of the Treaty. The Department of Defense considers that it would be premature and undesirable to ..discuss, either at the meeting of Ministers or before, the formation of an organization associating the military representatives of the participating nations. The Council and the political machinery of the Treaty should be established first. This could be followed by the creation of military machinery necessary to make the Treaty effective. In the view of this Department such military coordination should be similar to the ANZUS arrangements. It is recognized that it is not feasible to include in the Treaty itself details relating to implementation of the provisions by the Parties. However, the Department of Defense strongly urges that in the formulation of implementing procedures by the Council, the United States take a position in support of permitting concerted action by a lesser number than . the total of the signatory nations in the event that the political or territorial integrity of any signatory is threatened by Communist aggression in any form. In addition, careful consideration should be given to the practicability and desirability of providing voting machinery in the Council which would preclude- the possibility that, at some time in the future when the membership is expanded, a bloc of "neutrals" or a British Commonwealth bloc could exercise a controlling voice. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have expressed the opinion, with which I fully concur, that the recent developments in Geneva and Indochina, considered in conjunction with the general retrograde trend within the western Bloc, serve to increase the urgency of the need for a compro-hensive United States policy'with respect to the Far East region as a whole. This is necessary in order to give direction, cohesiveness, and greater effectiveness to the political and military actions which must now be taken to prevent the loss of the remainder of Southeast Asia to Communist control. It is considered that until the United States formulates and adopts such an over-all policy we shall be severely handicapped in any negotiations for the establishment of a collective      defense in the general area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. It would appear necessary that certain basic decisions be made with respect to how far the United States is willing to go in concert with all or certain of the non-Communist nations having interests in the Far East or, if necessary, unilaterally, in opposing further Communist accretions in the area under consideration.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff established four preconditions for United States participation in such a training program and you add the further consideration that an international interpretation of the cease-fire agreement may in any event impose limitations on the extent of military training, as well as end item assistance, that could be undertaken by the United States in Indochina. The first precondition of the Joint Chiefs is that there be a reasonably strong, stable civil government in control of the Indochinese states requesting United States assistance. This condition applies to the Government of Cambodia which is strong, stable and enjoys the whole-hearted loyalty of the population. A similar situation likewise exists in Laos but there, because of the restrictive terms of the cease-fire agreement and likewise because the Laotian Government has never made a request for U.S. training assistance, the problem does not arise. In the case of Free Viet Nam, the civil government, which has been under the presidency of Mr. Ngo Dinh Diem for only slightly more than a month, is far from strong or stable. However, we are currently perfecting measures which may assist that Government rapidly to increase the effectiveness of its administration. I should like to point out that one of the most efficient means of enabling the Vietnamese Government to become strong is to assist it in reorganizing the National Army and in training that army. This is, of course, the familar hen-and-egg argument as to which comes first but I would respectfully submit that the U.S. cf uld profitably undertake two courses of action in Free Viet Nam The Honorable Charles E. wilson, Secretary of Defense.      Tfia OTFT OLUld) I r. Viet Nam one, to strengthen the government by means of a political and economic nature and the other, to bolster that government by strengthening the army which supports it. The second precondition established by the Joint Chiefs is that the Governments of the Associated States should formally request that the U.S. assume responsibility for training their forces and providing military equipment. As indicated above the Government of Laos has made no such request and does not contemplate one. However, the Government of Viet Nam, in a letter from Prime Minister Prince Buu Loo to the American Charge dAffaires dated June 28, 1954, did request that MAAG Saigon participate in troop training and requested U.S. assistance in providing adequate armament and in financing a proposed expanded troup base. In the case of Cambodia, the Cambodian Minister of National Defense, General Nhek Tioulong in a letter dated May 20, 1954, addressed to General John W. ODonnel, Chief of MAAG Saigon, stated that the Royal Khmer Government was anxious to complete plans to set up in the minimum of time three divisions according to the methods of accelerated instruction used in Korea, on condition that the U.S. Government assured the Cambodian Government of indispensable financial and materiel supportThe third precondition of the Joint Chiefs calls for arrangements with the French guaranteeing full independence to the Associated States and providing for the' phased withdrawal of French forces, French officials, and French advisors from Indochina in order to  provide motivation and a sound basis for the establishment of National armed forces. t The case of Laos may be 'set aside since Laos has not requested U.S. assistance and under the terms of its military agreement with France is required to look to France for aid in training and other purposes. Furthermore, under the terms of the cease-fire agreement Laos is estopped from introducing foreign military personnel other than "a specified number of French military personnel required for the training of the Laotian National Army." In the case of Cambodia, de facto full independence already exists. Likewise during 1953 and early 1954 command of the Royal Khmer Army was'handed over to thL King of Cambodia and French forces have been entirely withdrawn from Cambodian soil. There is a minimum of French advisors still attached to the Royal Khmer Army. In the case of Viet Nam, practically the entire French Expenditionary Corps still remains in that country. It would be militarily disastrous to demand the withdrawal of French forces from Free Viet Nam before the creation 729 Declassified per Executive Ordcr 13526    ' SENSITIVE3creation of a new National Army. However, as seen from this Department, there would seem to be no insuperable objection to the U.S. undertaking a training program for the Vietnamese National Army while at the same time the French forces commence a gradual phasing out from that theater. ! . ' M As for the point you raised regarding the limitations of the Geneva settlement, in the view of this Department there is a limitation on the degree to which the Vietnamese armed forces can be increased. However, in my opinion, there is no provision of the cease-fire agreement regarding Viet Nam which would prevent the existing MAAG Saigon from undertaking a training mission or which would impede MAAG Saigon from rotating existing personnel to bring in number for number new personnel especially versed in military training. In the case of Cambodia there is no obstacle whatever to the setting up of a U.S. training mission. The cease-fire agreement affecting Cambodia provides in Chapter III Article 7 that the Royal Government of Cambodia will not solicit foreign aid in war materiel, personnel or instructors except for the purpose of effective defense of the territory. This latter clause makes it entirely possible for the Cambodian Government to request a foreign training mission and for the U.S., if it so desires, to provide such a mission. In the opinion . of this Department, it would be most helpful to the furtherance of our national policy in Indochina if the U.S. should reply affirmatively to the letter of the Defense Minister cited above, and it is recommended that the Joint Chiefs give their consent to the establishment of a MAAGPhnom Penh which would provide both training and logistical assistance to the Royal Khmer Army. The Department of State likewise feels that sympathetic consideration should be given to the establishment of a training mission'in MAAG Saigon to assist in the development of an effective Vietnamese National Army.

Furthermore, U.S, prestige Will inescapably be associated with subsequent developments in Southeast Asia. c. By adopting an appearance of moderation at GeneVa end taking credit for the cessation of hostilities in I.-dochina, the Communists will be- in a better position to exploit their political strategy of imputing tO the United States motives of extremism, belligerency, and opposition to co-existence seeking thereby to alienate ' the U.S. frOm its allies.

Manila. Following for your information text Aide Memoire delivered Department August 31 by Australian Embassy Verbatim text. "1. The Australian Government has welcomed the establishment of SEATO on the assumption that it would provide a firm basis for military planning in the area and a means whereby preparations could be made to cope with direct or indirect Communist aggression. The Australian Government has given public assurances that if such an organization is established it is prepared to make an increased military contribution to the defence of the area. "2. This policy, was laid down at a time when the United States Government was calling for the urgent establishment of a defence organization in Southeast Asia and appeared to be willing to participate fully in it. The Australian Government is therefore considerably disturbed at recent reports which appear to indicate that the United States does not rpt not now contemplate that any concrete military functions should be carried out by the organization set up under the treaty. If . this should turn out to be the case, then the value of the proposed treaty to Australia would be drastically diminished. The diffic Ities with which the United States Government would be faced at the present time -in maklng precrse commltments under SEATO are fully understood. At the same time the Australian Government feels there is a real danger that the present United States attitude m jht lead to a treaty without teeth of any kind, or to a treaty into which it would be very difficult to put any teeth subsequently. "3- It would also appear that, at a time when United States policy regarding the military functions of the DA IN 81950 (1 Sep 54) . u 743      MESSAGE SENSITIVE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY STAFF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE NR UNNUMBERED PAGE 2 organization has undergone a change, the United States view also seems to have hardened that the treaty should be aimed specifically at Communism. In these circumstances it seems that Australia might get the worst of both worlds. On the one hand Australia would be criticized in Asia for joining an organization which would be dominated by great non-Asian powers and which would be criticised as constituting a provocation to the Chinese, while on the other hand Australia would obtain no rpt no assurance that additional military protection would be given to an area which is strategically vital to Australia. It will be appreciated moreover that such a treaty would involve the Australian Government in considerable embarrassment domestically. The Australian Government would be attacked for subscribing to a treaty which seemed valueless, and there would be a danger that present public support for an expanded Australian defence effort would be dissipated. The Prime Minister recently impressed on Parlament that the present situation in Southeast Asia called for an international arrangement in the region under which all parties would be ready to undertake commitment. Australia's willingness to undertake such commitments in peacetime represents a real innovation in Australian policy. "4. In some respects the effect of present American thinking about SEATO i to provide little more than a commitment to act in the event of Communist aggression, without any effective understandings among the Allies as to what that action should be. "5 It is the Australian Government's earnest hope that the United States Government will agree to the establishment of effective military machinery under the proposed organization and will themselves participate in planning for the defence of the area. To this end Australia will press for inclusion in the text of the treaty of a specific undertaking that parties'would 'concert their military planning'. The Australian Government hopes that the United States Government will be able to accept this. "6. The Australian Government fully appreciates the difficulties involved (partly for security reasons) in detailed military planning among seven or eight nations. But the Australian Government considers that close contacts among, and joint military planning by, The United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand are essential. The latest American position, as presently understood, could give Australia less than the already existing Five Power Staff Agency; and the future even of this organization seems in DA IN 81950 (1 Sep 54) p j 744 SENSITIVE      MESSAGE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY STAFF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE NR UNNUMBERED PAGE 3 doubt in view of its virtual suspension at the request of the United States. "7. Like the United States, the Australian Government also contemplates economic activity being conducted outside SEATO. But a SEATO which is competent to discuss all these things should exercise this function at any rate to some extent, even though effective work in some directions may be done by smaller groups and possibly outside SEATO. Consequently in the Australian Government's opinion, regular and fairly frequent meetings of SEATO representatives are needed, and would be expected by Australian public opinion." End verbatim text.

C14 September 1054  HEiOPAHDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ' SUBJECT Report on the Manila Conferonce . " 1 . As Department of Defense representative on the U.S. Delegation to the Manila Conference (6-9 Septombor 1954) I submit for your information the attached text of a Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty (Tub A) as approved by the Conferoncc, together vtith comments relating to aspects of tho Treaty of special concern to the Department of Defense. General Comment As you know, the Manila Conference convened following Communist military achievements in Indochina and political and psychological suet cesses at Geneva. Against this background the effort of the Manila Conference to construct a collective defense arrangement for Southeast Asia' and the Soutrwest Pacific was directed in large measure to recovering from the psychological blow thus administered to the Free 'Yorld. Much of what was said at the Conference- bore witness to the preeminence of ' psychological objectives in the thinking of the participating States. In a real sense, the Treaty that emerged at Manila is a response to the Geneva Agreements. , Tho participating delegations placed great emphasis on the effect the wording of the Treaty would have, not only on the Communists, but also on their domastic populations. Thus the Treaty is a document that specks to many audiences it supports self-determination of peoples, self-goyernment end independence in deference to Asian nationalism; it provides for economic and technical cooperation as tm inducement to present Asian "neutralist" countries to associate themselves with the Treaty; it partnits the accession of other States, thus avoiding the charge that the Treaty members form an exclusive club with aggressive designs "agnir-St'' other States; it.describes thc Treaty area so as to exclude for the present Formosa, Japan, and Koran, St-tes toward which tho Trusty members hold differing policies- These elements of thc Treaty attest to the importance the member States place on tho effect of the document upon their respective publics. At the same time these elements give the Treaty thc character of a collective d,fonso arrangement in more than a purely military sense. Tho success that the Treaty may have in enhancing thc defense of the area will thorcforc have to be judged in light of the fact th-.t it has psychological r.nd economic as well as military objoc-ti v,s    With respect to the military aspects of the Treaty, most of tho par-ticirating States, notably the Philippines and Thailand, urged provisions that would explicitly com.it tho Treaty Parties to take military action in event of aggression in tho Treaty area. The commitment of thc United States to such action, of course, was thc purpose of these urgings. Much was said about thc desirability of the NATO as opposed to tho allegedly weaker .ANZUS formula. Most of the participating States argued that explicit commitments to take action vero necessary if the Treaty was to have the desired deterrent cffcct on thc Communists. The United States was faced in this issue, I believe, with thc dil-emma of attempting to attain two objectives that were not completely compatible on thc ono hand th.re was a desire to place tho Communists on notice as clearly as possible that further aggression in tho area would meet with effective collective counter-action. Such unequivocal notifi-cation would tend to enhance the psychological cffcct of tho.Treaty on thc Frec Ibrld and tho deterrent effect on tho Communists. Yet on thc other hand, in spite of the- greatcr psychological effect that a strongly vordcd Treaty might have, tho attainment of this object've was necessarily limited by the extent to. which tho United Statos, in itt own intcrost, could undortakc advance military commitments undcr th Treaty in rcstric-tion of its freedom of action. A. further limitation was the fact that thc United States can commit itself to take military action only in aocord-anco with its Constitutional processes. Thus, opposod to thc objective of maximum .psychological cffcct was tho necessity that the United States retain essential frocdom of action, and avoid treaty commitments that were inconsistent with Constitutional requirements and therefore projudicial to support for ratification of the Treaty by tho Senate, Tho Treaty as it stands agreed is in effect a reconciliation of these conflicting objective's. At thc moment it serves more a psycholog-ical than a military purpose. Thc area is no better prepared than before to cope with Communist aggression. As time goes on, however, tho Treaty cun providc a nucleus for coordinated defense, and may rally presently uncommitted States to the non-Communist side. Military Aspects cf thc Treaty You may recall that following tho work of the Joint U.S.-U.K. Study Group which mot from 7 to 17 July 1954 in Washington to lay tho groundwork for the Treaty, the Dapartmcnt of Stato prepared a draft which scrvcd as thc basis for discussions among thc Unitcd Sttcs and other interested. Governments. This draft was referred to tho Joint Chiefs of Staff.for comment on 22 July 1954, Thc viows of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sub- mittod to you on 13 August 1954, formed the basis of your letter of 17 August 1954 to the Secretary of State. This letter, together with a letter of 19 August 1954 from .Acting Secretary Anderson to Nr. Robert Murphy on tho subject of military machinery undcr thc Treaty, contained .     SENSITIVE the basic positions of this Department with respect to the Treaty, and guided Department of Defense representatives on the U.S. Delegation to the Manila Conference in discussions in the Eight Power working Group and in the Conference itself. The following provisions of the Treaty are- of special concern to the Department of Defense 1. Article IV is the heart of the Treaty, and generally follows the wording previously used in the Philippine, Korean, and ANZUS Treaties. It provides that "Each Party recognizes that aggression by means of armed attack in the treaty area against any of the Parties or against any State or territory which the Parties by unanimous agreement may hereafter designate, would endanger its own peace and safety, and agrees that it will in that event act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes." Secretary Dulles pointed out during the Conference that the wording of the North Atlantic Treaty, which speaks of an attack on one as an attack on all, nevertheless provides that the Parties will act in accordance with their constitutional processes. He persuaded the Conference that the final agreed wording of Article IV would be better received by the Senate, would tend to minimize debate, and would facilitate ratification by the United States. The Article further provides that the Parties shall consult imme- diately on measures of common defense if, in the opinion of any of the Parties, any Party in the treaty area is threatened by other than armed attack. This brings Communist aggression in the form of subversion and coup d'etat within the purview of the Treaty. ' 2. Article V establishes a Council to consider matters concerning the implementation of the Treaty. During the sessions of the working Group it became evident that some countries would propose wording calling for the establishment of military machinery, possibly along NATO lines. Recalling the position of this Department that military participation should be consultative along lines of the ANZUS arrangement rather than permanent and formal as in NATO, the Defense Representative in the working Group, Mr. C. A. Sullivan, in a message to Defense (SEATO No. 1, 2 September 1954) proposed that consideration be given to the mclusion of the following wording after the first sentence of Article IV "To this and the Parties to the Treaty will consult with regard to military planning as required by the situation in the area." Shortly thereafter the Australian delegation proposed the following addition to Article V "The Council shall set up such subsidiary machinery as may be necessary t achieve the military and other objectives of the Treaty." Since the Australian proposal involved an open ended commitment, this Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed it and accepted the wording suggested by the Defense representative.. The Department of State agreed, and instructed the U.S. Delegation to support incorporation of this wording in Article IV (TOSEC 25, 3 September 1954). 748 .     In the course of negotiation on this point the U.S. Delegation persuaded the Australian Delegation to accept a modification of its language removing reference to "machinery" and injecting the concept of consultation as the situation may require, as favored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and this Department. The U.S. Delegation on its part, accepted the placing of the amendment in Article V, and secured agreement of the Conference to wording which in substance reflected the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense views. Secretary Dulles, with my advice, succeeded in causing deletion of reference to "periodic" or "regular" consultation as several delegations at one stage proposed. The amendment in Article V as finally approved reads "The Council shall provide for consultation with regard to military and any other planning as the situation obtaining in the treaty area may from time to time require." 3. Article VII provides that other States may be invited to acceed to the Treaty by unanimous agreement of the Parties. Although the agreement of all the Parties to the inclusion of Nationalist China, Japan, or Korea is presently unlikely, such a possibility is not precluded. 4. Similarly, Article VIII, in defining the "treaty area", provides that the Parties by unanimous agreement can include other States in the treaty area or otherwise change the treaty area. The "treaty area" is defined as "the general area of Southeast Asia, including also the entire territories of the Asian Parties, and the general area of the Southwest Pacific not including the Pacific area north of 21 degrees 30 minutes . north latitude." This wording brings West Pakistan under protection of the Treaty even though it is not in Southeast Asia. The word "general" permits an eventual broadening of the treaty area. 5- All participating States except the United States supported exclusion of the word "Communist" from the Treaty. The U.S. draft originally referred to "Communist aggression" in the preamble and in Article IV. The chief reason advanced by the other signatories for the deletion was the desire of most of the Parties that the Treaty cover any kind of aggression in the area. Pakistan, for example, wished that the Treaty would apply to possible aggression by India. The Unites States position was that the United States could not properly say that any aggression in Southeast Asia would endanger its own peace and safety, and that it could accept the obligations of Article IV only in respect to Communist egression. For this reason the United States attached an "understanding" to the Treaty in this sense. All other participants accepted the Treaty with the U.S. "understanding". 6. At French suggestion specific reference to Cambodia, Laos, and Viet-Nam was removed from the text of the Treaty, but these States are covered by the provisions of the Treaty in a separate Protocol (Tab B). The French felt that this method of extending the application of the Treaty to the Associated States was less likely to.be construed as a . violation of the spirit of the Geneva Agreements. 7-49      7. I also attach for your perusal copies of the opening and concluding addresses of Secretary Dulles at the Conference (Tabs C and D). Implementation of the Treaty It can be expected that several of the participating States will shortly urge that an interim Council meet pending the time the Treaty is ratified and goes into effect. There is a general desire to keep up the momentum established at Manila. In such an event the subject of consul-tations with regard to military planning as referred to in Article V will undoubtedly arise. This is a subject to which we are giving additional thought with a view to developing further details of a U.S. position. Conclusion I believe the Manila Conference accomplished the objective expected of it from the Unites States point of view. In my judgment our Defense representation in the U.S. Delegation succeeded in its efforts to insure that the Treaty is consistent in its military implications with the positions taken by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by this Department. I should like to pay tribute to the brilliant work of Secretary Dulles, Herman Phleger, and Douglas MacArthur II. These men carried the principal burdens of the negotiations with forcefulness and intelligence, and advanced the interests of the United States by their efforts. A. C. DAVIS Vice Admiral, U. S.

SECRET CURRENT TRENDS IN SOUTH VIETNAM ESTIMATE 1. Since assuming office Premier Diem has bccn confronted with the usual problems of inefficiency, disunity, and corruption in Vict-namese politics and with the extraordinary problems of a mass evacuation of the Northern population and the hostility of many French officials. Despite his qualities of honesty and zeal, he has not yet demonstrated the neces-sa'ry ability to deal with practical problems of politics and administration. Lacking an organized political machine and finding control of the Army in the hands of an uncooperative ' chief of staff, Diems freedom of action has been severely circumscribed. 2. The French Government appears to have no definite policy toward South Victnam. While the French Government has not openly opposed the Diem Government, France has failed to support Diem and there is no evidence that the French are prepared to carry out a policy based on unreserved support for Vietnamese independence and nationalism. Accordingly, close cooperation between the French and Vietnamese governments, essential for the survival of South Vietnam, has been lacking and French motives have become more suspect3. Although little rea! progress has been made under Diems administration in dealing with pressing' political, military, and social problems, he still retains considerable unorganized popular support, particularly among Catholic elements of South Victnam. He has also made some progress in reaching agreement with the powerful Cochin China sects. 4. At the moment the Diem Government is thrcatencd by thc insubordination of General Hinh, the politically ambitious Chief of Staff whom Diem has discharged. It does not now appear that the present struggle bctwecn . Diem and Hinh will degenerate into civil strife. In fact Diem now appears to be making some headway in his efforts to control or exile Hinh, either of which would enhance his prestige and remove an obstacle to the strengthening of his government. 5. Bao Dai has remained in France and apparently is refraining from direct participation in political affairs in South Vietnam. His prestige among Vietnamese nationalists has been considerably lessened by his apathy toward the fate of his country. We believe that if Bao Dai were now to return to Vietnam, he would almost certainly become a center of political intrigue and would further complicate an already complex and confused situation and weaken rather than strengthen the ability of South Vietnam to achieve political stability. 6. Trends in South Vietnam since the end of thc Geneva Conference have enhanced the prospects of an eventual extension of Communist control over the area by means short of largc-scale military attacks. Although Diems government will probably survive the present crisis of Hinhs insubordination, and may achieve greater strength and popular support, it will continue to be threatened by Vietminh activity, and hampered by French indecision. Diem appears to be the only fio-. ure now on the political scene behind whom genuine nationalist support can be mobilized. However, his ability to crcate a government that could reverse the current trend in South Victnam depends at a minimum on an early and convincing demonstration by the French of their wholehearted support.

This is not the View of General Ely or his most experienced' and objective observers who see General Vy as preferable because of his character and experience, although lacking in Hinhs vivacity of- intelligence. At the same' time, being a man of action himself, General 01Daniel is impatient with the O hesitancy and weakness of thc Diem Government. purpose to comment upon these measure by thc Embassy as wel it is not my views, which arc held in some . The problem arises in the I Generals tendency to believe that all matters can be portrayed in sharp black and white and can be solved by forthright and direct act'on. General 0Daniel is handicapped by his own straightforwardness and honesty of character, which make him .. an easy target for those who wish to take him in, and by an unfortunate impression that he is a master of tact and guile ------------------------------------------------------------ 10 situation in question developed following when I discussed the sy on Sunday morning, September 12, ent political crisis which had reaahe a particularly dc.licate point with members of;the Embassy star representatives of another goVernment agency, and General 0Daniel.

I agreed that, while ideally the solution might be for Diem and Hinh to bury their differences, the matter was a little more difficult and I believed that at this moment neither I nor others should get in touch with Hinh. Before undertaking anything of'this sort, it would be necessary for me to see Diem, which I did not plan to do until the following day. It had been clear for some time that General ODaniel was eager to take a hand in the problem and he had previously offered "to be anybody's messenger" should the need arise. This knowledge was one of the reasons that I stated definitely that no one should see Hinh at this time. Unfortunately, despite my admonition, General O'Daniel, accompanied by his aide, went that afternoon to call on General Hinh at General Hinhs house and had a two-hour conversation with him concerning the political crisis. This conversation was reported in summary in my telegram 981. In essence, it appears that General O'Daniel inquired as to Hinh's attitude toward the President and as to his personal political ambitions and received the usual story from Hinh depicting himself a loyal, patriotic soldier without political ambitions and only too ready to cooperate with the President. It would appear clear, as has been indicated by ODaniel himself, that O'Daniel then suggested that, since Hinh felt that way, he should convey such a message to Diem in the hope that the' matter could be set right by a clear understanding and differences between the two men thus be settled. Hinh made a phone call immediately in O'Daniel's presence to the Secretary of State for Defense Chan, who promised to convey Hinh's message to the President. It is probable also that O'Daniel discussed, at least in general terms, his own solution for the Hinh-Diem conflict, which included the promotion of Hinh away from direct command of the army and placing him in the presidential palace as the supreme military adviser to the President. ODaniels intentions in this action which he took were certainly good. The fact remains, however, that he took this action in direct contravention of my instructions, indulging his tendency to take matters into his own hands and to mix into political situations without proper clearance from the Chief of Mission. This is not the first time that O'Daniel has taken hasty direct action himself with regard to a political problem. When difficulties began to shape up between Diem and Hinh and I had received a request from Diem to look into the possibility of having General Hinh invited to the United States in order to re- move him from the scene while the President established his 754  . J ? ' I SENSITIVE  Section   r authority over the-National trmy, I discussed the matter with . 0 lRt r.li General Odaniil was very much opposed to the idea 1 of rcttcing Hinh and 'to t tin manner of doing it. He expressed 1 himncif an nroforring Hinh to Diem, should he have to make a choice between the two menFollowing our conversation, and without indicating his in-tentiots to me, Gcoral ODaniel went to see Hinh and, as he put it, "sounded him out" on his attitude toward Diem and on whether or not he would consider visiting the United States atthis time. General O'Daniel returned to tell me that he was convinced of the sincerity and -patriotism of Hinh and of his willingness to co- operate 'loyally with the President. O'Daniel also said that Hinh would not consider visiting the United States at this time. This incident was reported in my telegram 706 of August 2f. Following his most recent'two-hour conversation with Hinh, O Daniel immediately tried to get in touch with me to report. As I vas absent at a special church service, he gave an account of his conversation with Hinh L Counselor Kidder. The following day, -September 13, I showed to ODaniel the draft of a telegram which I had prepared reporting this matter in detail to ths Department. ODaniel insisted that he had not heard my instructions and upon this assurance I destroyed thc telegram. It is possible that O'Daniel actually did not hear my instructions, as at the time he may well have been immersed in his own single-minded thoughts. General Trapnell, who preceded General 0Daniel as Chief of MAAG, remarked to me at one. time that the latter seldom listened when he was told something, particularly if he had any. scheme or idea of his own in mind. iiy relations with 0Daniel have been excellent an I expect them to contintU to be so.- ODaniel normally works in friendly and respectful. cooperation; I believe that he will not again in the immediate future indulge in political free-wheeling, but in the long run his impftuous temperament, which drives him to take action even in situations where action is inadvisable, will pro-, bably reassert itself. It is for this reason that I wish to be on record in this matter. .Donald R. Heath 755 .     THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF washington, D. C. 20301 t 22 September 1954 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE . Subject Retention and Development of Forces in Indochina ' 1. In response to a memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, dated 10 September 1954, subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit the following views and recommendations. 2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the provisions of the Geneva Armistice Agreement and the latest National Security Council policies for the Southeast Asia area. 3. The restrictions imposed by the Geneva Armistice Agreement on Cambodia are minor and can be overcome to a degree suffi- cient to carry out generally the U.S. national policies in that area. The restrictions on Laos are major and permit training, assistance and supervision by French instructors only. In Vietnam the cease fire agreement constitutes a major obstacle to the introduction of adequate US MAAG personnel and of additional arms and equipment. 4. Although the French have not submitted for U.S. study any plans they may have for withdrawal of French forces from Indochina, some informal and general information has been obtained as to their present intentions. Based upon this information and taking into account the estimated capabilities of the three nations of the Associated States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that those forces listed in the Appendix hereto shoId be retained or developed in Viet Nam and Cambodia. The estimated costs thereof, listed in the Appendix hereto must be reexamined in view of the lack of data related to condition and quantities of equipment and clothing, quantities of ICC, ammunition and arms to be reissued by the French. 5. Under the terms of the Geneva Armistice Agreement the training of Laotian armed forces may be conducted by French personnel only. However military equipment can be furnished in specified quantities for the defense of Laos through the French. 756. C-joU      6. The development of the proposed forces for Viet Nam and Cambodia will require extensive and detailed training which will extend over a period of 3 to 5 years. The French should relinquish over-all command of the Armed Forces of Viet Nam as rapidly as possible with complete removal of forces when the Vietnamese are capable of exercising command of an effective force. The Vietnamese capability along these lines should be developed by intensive training and by progressive promotion of Vietnamese officers to posts in command of larger units and to positions of increased responsibility. 7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that prior to the assumption of support of the forces of the state of South Viet Nam, a definite agreement should be obtained from the French Government with respect to the timing of their programmed phased withdrawal. The phasing out by the French should be correlated with the ability of the Vietnamese to take over this responsibility from the French, and at the same time assume command. 8. Although introduction of military equipment into Viet Nam above the levels existing at the time of signing the Geneva Armistice Agreement is prohibited, it is estimated that sufficient materiel is available in Viet Nam from that which was previously delivered to Indochina for the French Union Forces. The primary problem pertaining to materiel would be to insure that the French, while executing their phased withdrawal from Indochina, leave in Indochina the materiel and equipment required, insofar'as available, for the use of the Viet Nam Armed Forces. It should also be emphasized that this materiel and equipment should be left in good operating condition. 9. The supply of items such as pay, food, uniforms, and POL, should be furnished by the Associated States to the maximum extent of their capabilities. However, it is fully recognized that, due to economic conditions in the associated states, they would require extensive support concerning these items. Such support as may be supplied by the United States should be furnished out of Mutual Security funds administered by Foreign Operations Administration. 10. Indochina is an important part of Southeast Asia and merits limited U.S. support in implementation of national policy in that area. The United States is supporting military programs in this area, which possess a capability of producing effective military forces. In view of the uncertain capabilities of the French and Vietnamese to retrieve, retain, and 757 SENSITIVE      reorganize the dispersed forces of Vietnam, it may be several years before an effective military force trill exist. Therefore, U.S. military support to that area, including the training and equipping of forces, should be accomplished at low priority and not at the expense of other U.S. military programs and should not be permitted to impair the development through MDA programs of effective and reliable allied forces elsewhere. 11. In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note with concern the unstable political situation presently existing within the state of South Viet Nam, and, accordingly, consider that this is not a propitious time to further indicate United States intentions with respect to the support and training of Vietnamese forces. For the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Signed) ARTHUR RADFORD, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Enclosure Appendix 758      io? SENSITIVE THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF washington 25, D. C. 22 September 1954 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject U.S. Assumption of Training Responsibilities in Indochina. 1. This memorandum is in response to the memorandum by the Acting Secretary of Defense, dated 31 August 1954, which requested the comments and recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the State Department views on establishing a MAAG in Cambodia and a training mission in MAAG, Saigon. It also responds to the memorandum by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA) dated 15 September 1954 which transmitted additional State Department views on Cambodia to be considered in connection with the memorandum of 31 August 1954, and to the memorandum by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense . (ISA), subject "Training for the National Police Force of Vietnam," dated 21 September, 1954. A 2. In their memorandum for you dated 4 August 1954, subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff set forth certain conditions which they considered should be met before the United States assumes responsibility for training of the Armed Force of the Associated States. In their memorandum for you, dated 12 August 1954, subject "Message to the French Prime Minister" the Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterated two of these preconditions in their recommendations concerning the proposed message to the Prime Minister of France. From a military point of view, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that all of the previously expressed preconditions are still valid and desire to point out that conditions in South Vietnam fall short of meeting these preconditions. In the light of Presidential approval of the message to the Prime Minister of France and in light of Presidential approval of Sections II, III, and IV of NSC 54292, the Joint Chiefs of Staff offer no further objection in the establishment of a MAAG in Cambodia. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note with concern the unstable political situation presently existing within the state of South Vietnam, and  I 759 . SENSIT1VE .     accordingly consider that this is not a propitious time to further indicate United States intentions with respect to the support and training of either the Vietnamese regular or police forces. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs ofStaff recom-mend against the assignment of a training mission to MAAG, Saigon. 3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that special provisions of the bilateral agreement between the United States and Cambodia provide that all French advisors ultimately be withdrawn in order that the United States may deal directly with the Government of Cambodia, completely independent of French participation or control. The Joint Chiefs of Staff further recommend that no commitment be made at this time as to the size or composition of armed forces to be trained and supported, nor to the size and composition of the proposed MAAG in Cambodia, until further study can be given to these matters.

There is attached a letter from the Secretary of State which refers to two memoranda from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dated 22 Sep-tember 1954, on the subjects "Retention and Development of Forces in Indochina" and"U.S. Assumption of Training Responsibilities in Indo-china." These memoranda were made available to the Department of State by a letter from the Secretary of Defense, dated 28 September 1954. 2. In the attached letter Secretary Dulles raises two related aspects of the military situation in Indochina force levels of in-digenous forces, and U.S. training responsibilities for Vietnamese forces. He points out certain political considerations which he feels affect both these subjects. , .  3. In the light of the views expressed in this latest letter from the Secretary of State, it is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit their comments and recommendations with respect to the levels of forces that should be developed in Viet-Nam, Lajos and Cambodia, including their concept of the objectives of such forces from the U.S. military point of view and an estimate of the annual operat- ing cost of training and maintaining such forces. 4. It is further requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit their comments and recommendations concerning, a U.S. commitment to train Vietnamese forces, in the light of the considerations pointed out by the Secretary of State in his letter. In view of the special emphasis placed on an urgent determination of a U.S. course of action toward the training question at a meeting of the Operations Coordinat-ing Board on 13 October, the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this subject are requested as a matter of high priority.

No one is more aware, than you that the neutralist world, no ung the course of the future, will eventually make.a choice between Coramunisa and freedom. The ultimate fate of the frcc portion of Indochina will become a critical element in that choicc for the vast millions living in the uncommitted regions of Asia and the Middle East. The loss of the rest of Indoclrina in con. sequence of the 16 elections or otherwise, would inevitably sway many of these trillions to Mtnuni cm.

On the other hand, the lack of a basis for t tderstanding between the indigenous people in Indochina and the French' has r L been one of thc- primary reasons for thc free worlds failure in Indochina, We havc hesitated to face up to making dccisions regarding proposals for Indochina . because wc are not confident that uc can defeat the Communist at their own Thc methods we have tried to reach the minds'of the actual and potentialpro- freedom leaders in Indochina have not been successful.

Herbert summary This will be an oral report on the subject by the Chairman of the OCB, . Toover, Jr., or someone designated by him. It will probably include a of the recent U.S.-French discussions on Indochina as well as of the current situation there. C 2. The OCB, at its 6 October meeting, requested its special Working Group on Ind'pchina to prepare a program of economic and military aid to the three Associated States to include both dircct aid and aid to be granted in coordination with the French, these aid programs to be based on the tcntative force goals developed by the JCS. This program is now being developed. The JCS recommended force goals are attached as TAB A; State comments thereon as TAB B. r 3. At its meeting of 13 October, the OCB agreed that State and Defense, as a matter of urgency, should develop guidance on U.S. training of Free Vietnamese forces for approval by the Board at its meeting on 20 October. Mr. Cutler has expressed "considerable concern at OCB meetings over the failure on the part of the U.S. to get a military training program underway in Vietnam. The JCS, however, have been dubious regarding this sort of U.S. military involvement in Indochina because of the unstable political situation and the limitations on the- size of the MAAG imposed by the Geneva Agreement and recommended- against such training unless political considerations were overriding (see TABS C and D). At the COB meeting of 20 October, State said political considerations are, in fact, overriding and the OCB is, wc understand, directing immediate commencement of U.S. military training in Vietnam. The OOBs draft recommenda-.ions are- at TAB E.' .  4. This OCB action may have broken the log-jam of inactivity regarding  'r . Vietnam which has gripped the U. S. Government since Geneva. However, there are many, other possible psychological and political action programs which may deserve . a try in a real effort to keep free Indochina from being assimilated by the .. Communists. Therefore, continued, streamlined efforts by the Departments and Agencies concerned, given highest priority, seem necessary. RECOMMENDATIONS .  . 5. It is recommended that you suggest that the Council; a. Discuss whether the current U. S. approach to the problems of Indochina, is yet fully adequate to achieve our objectives there. b.

REPORT OF THE VAN FLEET MISSION TO THE FAR FAST SUMMARY OF GENERAL AND POLICY OBSERVATIONS Chapter 5United States Position in the Far East An Appreciation 1. The Problem ' The problem before us is the failure of U.S. leadership in the Far East. In the light of enormous communist gains in Korea and Indochina, and the generally deteriorating situation throughout the area, the national security policies we have been following are pointing towards ultimate defeat. We must exercise necessary leadership and develop opropriate policies for that role2. The Enemy1 s Design So long as the Chinese Communist regime exists, . it will not abandon its goal of conquest, or dominance of East and South- ast Asia. For the next several years, Communist China is a greater menace to the Free world than the Soviet Union itself3. Implementation of the Design Since the end of World war II, the Chinese Communist regime has waged a relentless war against the free world, specifically the United States. The conquest of China, Korea and Indochina have been stages. Geneva is but a first installment. It appeal's certain that Communist China will press on towards the objective of controlling all of Southeast Asia. Her further aggressive aims have been publicly announced ("liberation" of Formosa Ho Chi Minhs intention to take over all Vietnam). Communist China regards the Korean armistice only  as a deferral of the ultimate aim of control of all Korea. 4. The Common Enemy The common enemy in the Far East is Communist China, aided and abetted by Soviet Russia. Communist China has pursued a middle course -- pushing forward her program of conquest, but never to the point of precipitating unlimited war with the U.S. we, by our actions and inactions, have transformed a once weak communist regime into a world power. Peace with freedom cannot be restored to Asia as long as the Chinese Communist regime continues to exist. Unless we stop her now, the results will be catostrophic and we will be forced to intervene eventually anyway to restore the balance. 5. Implications of Free world Defeat Further defeats could lead to a chain reaction and loss of the whole area, including India, to the Communist orbit or its neutralization. Communist control of Asia would be an important step towards control of Europe. "we must recognize that the defeat we . have suffered in Indochina is merely a part of the price we are paying for weakness in Korea -- for the Red Chinese victories in Korea that our selfimposed limitations forced on our commanders, for an armistice that relieved Red China of the strains of war . The future will reveal other prices we. must pay for the free world defeat in Indochina." 794      "Toward the last stages of the war in Indochina, those who opposed intervention . expounded the principle that two conditions were necessary to justify our intervention First, that the local government must exercise e'fi'ective control; and second, that the local population must be friendly to the United States. In reality, this principle is largely a paraphrase of the position developed in the State Department's 'China white Paper ... to explain our failure to prevent the loss of the mainland of China to the Communists. Moreover, it must be pointed out that it is a very dangerous doctrine that invites explanations for future failures and defeats. Its greatest danger is that it overlooks a prime responsibility of leadership, i.e., to strive to create conditions favoreble for positive action." 6. Defeat Unnecessary --Our defeat is unncessary. There are large indigenous material and human resources in the areh -which can be developed and harnessed in the event of hostilities with Red China. Twice we let slip the "decisive strategic opportunity" of subtracting Communist China from the Soviet orbit, and thus beginning the rollback of Communist power in Korea and Indochina. When Chinese communist aggression starts again, as it undoubtedly will, we must be prepared to strike back and seize that strategic opportunity. 7. Free World Assets Considered separately, the problems of Korea, Formosa, Japan and the Philippines appear insoluble except through ultimate defeat; for these countries are in the line of march for communist conquest. On the other hand, considered as a regional area, linked to U.S. influence and power, they have assets of great present value, and even greater potential value. General Van Fleet then analyzes the actual and potential strengths of these countries, emphasizing the role they might play in a united offensive with the U.S. against Communist China. 8. Failure of Leadership Despite the real and potential free world strength in Asia, we have continued to suffer one defeat after another. Our failure in the Far East is one of leadership; it is a failure to consolidate Free World resources of the Far East and make of those consolidated resources an instrument of Free World power and influence. We have failed to create conditions for the development of a strong, friendly role by Japan, we have failed to solve the Jananese-Korean problem. We have failed to solve the Japan-Philippines reparations problem. Our technical assistance and economic aid programs have been inadequate. Our educational and exchange programs have been weak and inadequate. Above all, we have failed to develop for ourselves a firm policy for the Far East, to decide what sort of a position we wish to build there. Under our present national security policies in the Far East, we are in no position to solve the dilemna, save by compromise built on compromise. Equally, we cannot redress the balance in Asia if we give Britain and France a veto over our policies in the area. 795 G i      SENSITIVE 9. Halting the Shrinkage in the Free World We are doomed to ultimate defeat in the Far East if we continue to be precluded from taking strong action. If the shrinkage of the'free world is to be halted, we must begin the rollback of communist power, we must exert constant pressure against China to undermine her position. In the event of Communist assault on Formosa, we should take the offensive against China proper. Communist attack on the offshore islands would present us the opportunity of destroying a large part of the Chinese Communist air strength, and furnish the occasion for the start of the rollback which might profitably begin with the recapture of Hainan. American opinion will support such a strong rolicy in Asia. Chapter 6. Observations of the Chief of Mission 0. This policy would have two aspects to be concurrently followed ,1) defensively, the development of increasing strength and stability in East Asia, (2) the maintenance of continuous pressures against the -Communist apparatus. A regional, multi-national organization, integrating the assets of the nations in question, will insure the phased development of military, political and economic strengths. In particular, "Under the conditions extant today, Formosa represents an asset which transcends considerations of pure defense. It constitutes the most important springboard for the projection of all manner of operations against the Chinese Communist mainland. It is the potential rallying point for the totality of non-communist Chinese in Asia, under a liberal political platform which could have a profound appeal to the Chinese masses. It houses a vehemently anti-communist government which could contribute significantly to a regional organization designed to solidify the free nations of Asia as a pre-requisite to action calculated to undermine and weaken the Communist bloc." Chapter 7Explanation of Approach to Survey 11. "Cursory examination revealed that there were no positive and consistent United States policy statements . with respect to East Asia and its component countries. Similarly lacking were clear and unmistakable prime military missions for the forces of the several countries . Consequently, certain hypothetical policies were established in order to secure a quantitative measure of the forces required for the support thereof" The first envisages an intermediate policy designed to develop increasing strength among the free nations of Asia while maintaining pressures to undermine and weaken Asian communist regimes and being prepared to exploit by offensive action the situations created by such pressures. This policy, he states, is geared to the announced intentions of the Administration, although not adequately reflected in current national security policies. The second policy considers preventive war. The third policy considers a distinctly defensive posture.      L 1 1 -UkU General Van Fleet's analysis and recommendations as to the mission, size and composition of military forces for East Asian countries are apparently based primarily upon the first assumed policy, as illustrated by General Van Fleet's statement of the general mission of the expanded and improved East Asia indigenous forces stated in his "Summary of Recommendations the Area as a whole" on (D (2) (3) (4) (5) Maintenance of internal security; Defense against external aggression; Exertion of constant pressure- against the Communist enemy; Exploitation of opportunities arising from the cumulative effects of constant pressure against the enemy, and Development of an adequate base for maximum mobilization in the event of war with Communist China or a general war. 797      SUBJECT n-l NOV Indochina.

Ke said that he had not been instructed to make a demarche but had come on his own initiative to express his misgivings and deep anxiety with regard to the course of events in Indochina. He said that the information he had received officially, and in personal communications from General Ely, led him to feel that the chances of Diem succeeding in forming a government of national unity and of acquiring authority were very slight. He said that General Ely, in whom he had unbounded confidence, had done everything he could to bring about a settlement of the Diem-Hinh quarrel. He had succeeded in obtaining from Hinh the undertaking that he would limit himsol entirely to military affairs and would stay away from politics. He had brought H5nh to the point where he had agreed that he would take orders from Diem. However Dic-m had on his part been adamant and is insistingon .getting rid of . Hinh. .THis" deadloctcTias created a dangerous situation in which so younger officers behind Hinh are beginning to agitate to the point i of the here the <0 O'? N possibility of civil disorder cannot be excluded. Should this happen, the French Expeditionary Force would in no circumstances go into action against Vietnamese troops but would only look toward its own security.  The Ambassador commented in a rueful tone that "France now had everyone against her in Indochina." He said that tha President's letter to-Diem had --created a sensation in Saigon and was bain 7-1.. fl . Copy No(s) J Destroyed in       2Washington agreements, by which Ambassador Heath need no longer consider himself bound. It was felt that the President's letter had given Diem full rein without requiring of him as a preliminary condition that he should first succeed in forming a strong a.nd stable government, even though this-p.lirdnarycondition had been part of.the basis.pfth1T'ashington agreements. ' A further aspect of the Presidents letter which is giving the French concet-. is the use which the Viet Minh could make of this step in relation to the Armistice agreement. The Ambassador said that thc Viet Minh would doubtless I wish to exploit this possibility, especially if the situation were to deteriorat furthe . In addition to the French Expeditionary Force now located in Southern Viet hem, there was the matter of the troops in Haiphong, which were not to be evacuated until May 1955- All this added up to a very delicate situation, potentially da all good faith .nd of uncertain prospects. ador said that in and despite the best vdll in the world to make the Diem experiment work, the outlook seemed to be deteriorating rapidly. He was also concerned by what seemed to him to be a lack of Franco-American coordination with regard to the course of action to be taken in Indochina and said he hoped it would be possible for us to consult each other again-more closely, and bring our positions The Secretary said that he was giving the situation in Indochina the greatest attention, and he agreed that it was a difficult and delicate problem He pointed out that Diem needed all the support that he could get from every quarter and that it was not enough to say th was going to support Diem but that he hadnt much chance. The support must be positive and continuous in order to be effective. The Secretary said that he had had a talk with Premier Mendes-France in Paris on Indochina and that he would shortly be sending him. situation there. EURWEWRTylermt       November 17, 1953  MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT Subject General Collins' Recommendations Regarding Military Force Levels in Viet-Nam % General Collins has submitted a report and his recommendations regarding force levels in Viet-Nam. A breakdown of the proposed forces as recommended is attached as Tab A. In summary, the main points of his report are as follows 1. It would be disastrous if the French Expeditionary Corps were withdrawn prematurely since otherwise Viet-Nam could be overrun by an enemy attack before the Manila Pact Powers could act. 2. The United States should continue to subsidize the French Expeditionary Corps during calendar year 1955, at least to the degree of one hundred million dollars, to encourage the French to retain sufficient forces. (The current rate of U.S. subsidy is four hundred million annually). 3. The Vietnamese National Army, now totaling 170,000 should be reduced by July 1955 to 77,000. It should be placed under Vietnamese command and control by that date. It would be organized into six divisions, three of which would be field elements designed to reinforce the balance of the Army which would be stationed in regimental and battalion garrisons throughout the provinces. A small Air Force and Navy is provided for. The cost to the U.S. would be two hundred million dollars annually. (This is less than current costs)    SENSITIVE 24. The United States should assume training responsibility for the Viet-Nam National Army by January 1, 1956 with French cooperation and utilizing French trainers. 5.

Stasten told French Ambassador Bonnet that the United States would contemplate,, subject to an agrcement being rcachcd bc-tween Generals Collins and Ely? and subjcct to discussions with certain Congressional leaders the following futurc aid to France with respect to Indochina ' , (a) Thc sum of 100 million dollars for support of the French Expeditionary Corps during the calendar year 1955, Any counterpart French francs accruing after January 1955 front any U, S. aid with respect to, Indochina would be applied in discharge of this commitmcnt if such commitment is actually made. Likewise,, any savings effected as. indicated in Sub-diyision (b) bclow in expenditures of the 1954 budget programs v.'ould bc applied against this commitment if and when made and not be an addition to it0 ' . .' r (b) The programmed 1954 budget expcnditures in rcspcct-to the French Expeditionary Corps would bc continued but would only cover supplies,, equipment, etc. ac tual ly- sent to Indochina on or prior to Decembcr 31s 1955. As stated abovct if this arrangement resultcd in any savings below the original 785 million dollars programmed for this French budget support,, such savings would be first applied against the foregoing 100 million dollar commitment and not be made available to thc addition thereto. ,. I had had no notice of this mooting prior to today when I arrived at the airport on return from th s 1 French in 200 P.M Now York City where I .attended the Navy League Dinner last night. The time of my return was dictated by thc fact that I was traveling by commercial transport and no scats were available until the 1220 P.M. plane from New York City. The notice of the meeting to the Defense Department as distinguishcd from me personally v5- 802 .     was not received until 100 P.M. today. Both Stassens office and the State Department disclaim responsibility for the lack . of notice, but Molting of Statc indicated to me over the tcle-phono that the meeting was known tothe Statc Department since last Saturday, .> Orally at thc mooting, I stated that the Department of Defense had not had any opportunity to check tho details of ' the 100 million dollars mentioned for FEC support during the . calendar year 1955. Through pcncillcd notcs? I informed ; Stassen while he was talking that the Departmcnt of Defense had never agreed to the original position paper in that rcspcct which was based on a recommendation from Gcneral Collins without any details showing the basis of his calculations. In addition, such notes made clear to Stasscn that I had called Livingston Merchant on Monday November 22t and asked him whcther and when any meeting would be held with thc French on thc subject of financial aid to the FEC and othcrwise in Indochina stating that Defense had some idcas it would like to present, I told Mr. Merchant.that I did not feci it Nas i Defenses job to gct in touch with the Frcnch, that I assumcd State would take the load in that rcspcct and that State would get in touch with Defense so that we might compare notes before any meeting, Mr. Merchant agreed with that position but did not at that time mention the fact that any meeting was scheduled, with the French for Wednesday NoVcmber 24O Ambassador Bqnnet at the meeting indicated that the 100 million dollar support for the FEC during calendar year 1955 was far bclow. the amounts which the French had cxpcctcd to receiVe from the United States in that respect and that if the United States remained firm at that figure,. Gcneral Ely would probably have to make a substantial revision in his estimates as to the numbers of men in the FEC to be retaincd in Indochina, Ambassador Bonnet statcd that he would com-nunicate Stasscn5s statements to the French Government and that it would probably take some days beforc any reply could bc made. Stasscn endeavored rather briefly to argue with Bonnot.that ICO million dollars would bc sufficient in the absence of any war activity- pointing out that only 256 million dollars had boon utilized by the FEC (based on bills received to date) under the Laniel-Navarre Plan which required much greater activity on the part of the FEC. Bonnet rcplied that all of thc bills are not yet in and that whilc he could not make any calculations, he was confident that the 100 million dollars would not meet the current Ely program with respcct to the FEC803 o      f . .' . .; . < During the mooting I examincd the picce of papcr from which Stassen was reading. It was a singlc sheet which I had never seen before and on it was indicatcd that certain . , details had been received from Collins with rcspcct to.his , ICO million dollar calculation for thc FEC during calendar 1955. I have never seen such dctails and do not know whether they have been made available to my office. Fur thermorc,. ( the typewritten portion of such shcct stated that no budget , I ' support would be granted to supplies,. cquipmcntT etc. not receiVed in Indochina without spccifying any' limiting date. r The idca of a limiting date in this respect of Dcccmber 31s I 1955 was inserted in pencil. ! .' I After the meeting, I complaincd to Stassen about our lack of notice of the 300 P.M. mccting today. He rcplicd that he personally had not rcceivcd any longer notice than '  I had and that the cntirc comraitmcnt as phrased was bascd on the Dulles dcsire to communicate as promptly as possible .. to the French that their expectations of receiving budget support in the amount of $300 million for calendar year 1955 were without foundation and that the 100 million dollar commitment as made was based on the recommendation from General Collins. I replied that I was fully aware that Secretary Dulles did not want to give the French a valid ' . excuse for pulling out of Indochina completely and leaving . thc problem in our hands without the French available to bcar r, any responsibility, but that Defcnse had not agrccd5 insofar as I knewc to the original position papcr on this subject and had accepted thc Collins rccommendation of $100 million subject to an opportunity to check thc basis of his calculations. I further explained that I had told the State Depart- meat (I belieVe it was Livingston Merchant but it might have been Nolting) during thc Mcndcs-France and Dulles talks ! that I believcd we should express any statements made about ICO million dollars for the FEC as a maximum and give thc impression that it might be reduced. Such was not done by . C Stassen and apparently my cx'pression of opinion had never been communicated to him, ' I further made thc point that Dcfense had a substantial interest in these matters that Defensc approval should be . sought in advance of any discussions with the French or at least Defense be given an opportunity to express its opinion and that any meeting scheduled should only be after adequate      .     , i Copy 1 of 10 copies. t DEPARTMENT OF STATE Memorandum of Conversation DATE December 7,' 1994 SUBJECT Vietnam and Southeast .Asia T" PARTICIPANTS Senator Mike Mansfield Assistant Secretary Walter S.

The prospects for helping Diem strengthen and uphold look very dim given the best.cf circumstances. Any elections will probably favor the Communists. in 1?$6 2. Nevertheless, the United States should continue to exert its efforts and use its resources, even if it will cost a lot, to hold Vietnam as long as possible. Any other course would have a disastrous effect on Cambodia, Laos and Southeast Asia. The Senator strongly opposed the idea of abandoning our effort in Vietnam. That course of action would lead to-the absorption of Cambodia and Laos by the Communists 3. Therefore 40950  This Doc DCR Contra! I 1 806 7GG1 .     23. Therefore, he felt we should continue to do whatever was possible to support the government of Diem. Senator Mansfield sees no alternative Prime Minister. While recognizing Diens weaknesses as an administrator and manager, Senator Mansfield feels we ought to continue to back Diem, strongly encourage him to make Dr. Quat Minister of Defense immediately, and urge Diem to delegate as much as possible of the day-to-day operations of the government to others. Senator Mansfield was of the opinion that General Collins 1 time limit of two to three weeks was playing with "political dynamitet because it Was giving Diem such an awfully short time in which to show results or ba replaced f. With respect to Mr. Robertsons point that the French would subject the Secretary to great pressure on immediately finding a replacement for Dien, Senator Mansfield took the strong position that this line of action would only confound the already groat difficulties in Vietnam. It would add much confusion, take time, and probably increase the divisions within Vietnam beyond what they are today. Senator Mansfield was certain the refugees and many of the Catholic bishops and church officials would oppose the replacement of Diem. The Senator felt, that Diem represented what small hope there may be in building something in Vietnam. He was against relinquishing even the small chance we have with Diem for some unknown and untried combination. ' 9. Senator Mansfield agreed with General Collins recommendation that Embassy Paris urge Bao Dai to cease the long distance wirepulling from the Riviera and to give Diem complete backing and initiative to run the govern-went without interference from Bao Dai Senator Mansfield strongly urged that it was so important to get this idea across to Sao Dai that Ambassador i Dillon himself should make the approach assuming the publicity of such a meeting could be kept to a minimum. The Senator also felt very strongly  that Bao Dai should not return to Vietnam. 6. In addition to the above, Senator Mansfield said that Dr. Quat  in his opinion was an able man who could do much to help bring the army under control and into loyal support of the government. He hoped Diem would appoint Quat right away . The Senator said that the remarkable aspect of Diem was unlike most of the Vietnamese, he really was honest, incorluntible and a devoutly dedicated nationalist as well. However, the ' Senator expressed the personal view-that in politics one often has to make . some compromises in order to get results. He thought that Diem should be r encouraged net only to delegate responsibilities to trusted and capable ministers, but should also give in to a certain amount of compromise. The ' Senator suggested that Dr. Fishel would probably be the best person to work out with Diem the problem of delegation and political adjustments. It was clear that the Senator had great confidence in Dr. Fishel. He hoped that the Department and the Embassy would give the latter full leeway and since he appeals to have the complete confidence of Diem. On Nr. Robertsons point t ... that i r r  ' 50951 ' ---------- 8u'     3 1 that the French and the British would continue to push very hard for Tam, Senator Mansfield was firmly opposed to our accepting Tam or exerting any pressure at all on Diem to include Tam in his cabinet. Senator Mansfield agreed with Mr. Robertson that to co so would compromise the cabinet and provide the Communists with a ready made argument for ' charging the Diem government with being a puppet of the old colonial . regime.

RaPtr FROM TiHS      SECRET Refer to 1=16,521 . C-R 1-8270 (Unci)' Dec 14 1954 Dear Mr. Chairman . The Secretary of Defense has requested that I reply to your letter 01 17 November 1954 to the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration requesting a report on the military aid situation in Indochina. t . The facts of the military aid situation in Indochina insofar as the Department of Defense is involved follow a. The value of MDAP shipments to Indochina (in millions of dollars), including value of equipment furnished from excess U. S. stocks, as of 31 October 1954, is Total Army Navy Air Force i $1,085-5 $764.2 $154.3 $167.0 Regular MDAP ' 948.0 633.1 151.7 163.2 Special Military Support 123.7 U7.3 2.6 3-8 Common Use 13.8 13.8 0 0 I b. No official reports of losses of aimament and equipment have been released by the French. However, it is estimated by U.S. officials that the following items of equipment, valued at approximately $1.2 million, fell into Viet Minh hands at Dien Bien Phu. 8 4 20 30 12 150 15,000 M-24 Tanks 155mm Howitzer Guns 105mm Howitzer Guns 8lmm & 120mm Mortars 75k1 Recoilless Rifles Machine Guns Small Arms In addition to the equipment lost at Dien Bien Phu, small quantities of small arms, machine guns, ammunition and personal troop equipment have been captured by the Viet Minh during the prolonged military operations in IndochinaCOPY SECRET 818 .     f E ' ' SECRET c. The Department of Defense has not supplied any fixed assets north of the 17th parallel. d. Since the signing of the Geneva Agreement, all shipments of materiel to Indochina have ceased except those items required to alleviate suffering, prevent disease, and assist in the evacuation from North Vietnam. e. The Department of Defense plans to initiate direct aid to Vn-tnam and Cambodia on 1 January 1955- The details of the military plans and MDA programs to implement such plans are under active study and development by appropriate agencies of the U.S. Goverrmfent. There are no pl ns to give military aid to Laos at this time because under the terms oi the Geneva Agreement, no U.S. military advisors are admitted in the country. The form of the aid for the two Associated States is to be concentrated on training a force capable of maintaining internal security and to eventually develop an army capable of fighting a delaying action in case of invasion from the North. It is hoped that the French Expeditionary . Corps will remain in the area until native troops can be trained to replace them. " f. Negotiations with the French are being conducted at this time with the view of returning to U.S. custody all materiel no longer required in Indochina. g. When the GenevtAgreement was signed, there were 211,000 long tons of MDAP materiel in French depots north of the 17th parallel. As of 20 November 1954, over 50 of this equipment had been evacuated. Fifteenhundred long tons per day is the target for evacuating the above materiel. The daily averages of evacuation to date indicate that the French are more than meeting this target and it is estimated that all depot stocks will be evacuated from the North by 1 March 1956 and returned to depots in the South. Equipment issued to the various military units is evacuated with the units. The materiel in the South is being inventoried and upon completion, a determination will be made as to the equipment that is no longer required for operations in Indochina. Materiel that is not required will be returned to the custody of the U.S. for distribution to other areas. As an indication of the thoroughness of the French evacuation of military equipment, all pierced-steel planking used on airfield runways and taxiways have been dismantled and shipped to the South.

With anticipated eppesition frem the sects and scene from Diem himself, who is leatho. tO disband his Own private fcrce (national guard), it will take stronger leadership frera Diem and Minh than either hss shewn to date tO reduce and amalgamate these forces.  4.

When I tcld Diem recently that cur FOA pecple Were having difficulty in getting dOwn t-O businsES With the Vietnam agriculture officials, Diem reminded, me that the Minister Of agriculture is a Hca Hao and the Eca Heo are fearful Of the effect of land refOrm on their extensiVe cantrOl Of rice lands.

L- ..       STATEMENT OF POLICY by the NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL ' . onCURRENT U. S.POLICY IN THE FAR EAST GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  1 The primary problem of U. S. policy in. the Far East is to cope with the serious threat to U. S. security interests Which has resulted frcm the spread of hostile COmmunist power on the continent of Asia OVer all of Mainland China, North Korea arid,, more recently, over the northern part of Viet Nam2, In its five years of power, the regime in Communist China has established and consolidated effective . control over the mainland and has maintained and developed close working relations with the Soviet Union. While there is now no reason to anticipate an early collapse of the regime nor any means of seeing when one might occur, inherently such regimes have elements of rigidity and instability vzhich sometimes produce crises. We should be ready to exploit any oppOrtunities which might occur as a result of inherent internal weaknesses. NSC 54-295  1. 837 .      3. The task of the United States in coping with this ituation is further complicated by , a. The vulnerability of the non-Communist countries in the area militarily, and in Varying degrees, politically, economicallyj and psychologically, to further Communist expansionist efforts. b. The deep-seated national antagonisms and differ ing assessments of national interest wtich diVide those I countries from each other and seuerely hamper efforts to combine their collective resources for their own defense and welfare. c. The intense nationalistic feelings, fed by residual resentments against European colonialism coupled with a Widespread feeling of weakness and inadequacy in the face of the worldwide power struggle, which inhibit many of these countries from cooperating closely with the United States. d. The divergencies on Far Eastern policy with our European allies, principally with respect to our posture toward China, which limit the extent of political and economic pressures which can be maintained against the Asian Communist regimes without diVisiVe effects on the basic United States-led coalitionNOTE In addition to the foregoing general considerations, attention is ' directed to NIE l35h, "Communist ' China's Power Potential Through 1957," r . published June 3> 1954-, and NIE 10-7-5h, "Communist Courses of Action in Asia Through 1957," published NoVember 23, 195h-. NSC 54295        OBJECTIVESb -V' h. Pursuant to a policy of being clear and strong in its resolve to 'defend its vital interests, if necessary at the L risk of but without being proVocative of war, the principal objectives ofthe United States in the Far East should be a. Preservation of the territorial and political ,  integrity of the non-Communist countries in the area against further Communist expansion or subVersion. b. Progressive improvement of the relative political, economic and military pOsition of the non-Communist countries Vis-a-vis that of the Asian Communist regimes. c. Reduction of Chinese'Communist power and prestige, or' securing by reorientation a GOVerntnent on the mainland of China whose objectiyes do not conflict with the Vital interests of the United States, d. Disruption of the Sino-SoViet alliance through actions designed to intensify existing and potential areas of conflict or divergence of interest between the USSR and Communist China sr L e. Creation in Asia of political and social forces which will zealously spread the greater Values of the Free World and simultaneously expose the falsity of the Communist ideological offensive. COURSES OF ACTION 5. In order to preserVe the territorial and political integrity of the area, the United States should NSC 5U295 TUP SECRET 833       . a. Maintain, the security of the Pacific off-shore ' island chain (Japan, Ryukyus, Formosa and the Pescadores, r J the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand) as an ele- ment essential to U.S. security; assisting in deVeloping  . such military strength in each area as is required by  U.S. security and is consistent with each areas caps- A .  bility and maintenance of domestic stability. L. b. In the eVent of unprovoked attack on the Republic r . of Korea, employ, in accordance with Constitutional pro- cesses, U.S. armed forces against the aggressor. While supporting the unification of Korea by all peaceful r. means and maintaining appropriate safeguards against ROK <offensiVe action, continue military and economic assis- tance programs consistent with U.S. security interests and subject to continued ROK cooperation.  c. Ratify the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic ) of China coVering Formosa and the Pescadores, and jointly ? agree upon appropriate safeguards against Chinese National. ist offensive action.

The Secretary decided we should proceed as schcduled and "take . the plunge" on January 1. Mr. Robertson and I stated the pros and cons. Mr. Robertson pointed out our prestige would be considerably more committed in the three Associated States and our ability to disengage made more difficult by this step. On the other hand, I pointedout-it would give us more leverage, put our missions on a direct footing and carry out the understanding reached with the French and the thrce Associated States last September and October. I explained to the Secretary that Governor Stassen had set up an operational mechanism which would keep our direct aid fluid and flexible so that it could be tapered up or down quickly depending on ; developing circumstances. Mr. Robertson stressed that no amount of aid  would be announced at this time or conveyed to the governments concerned.' The Secretary ihdicatcd his approval of this general line or approach, and,' that the program would be subject to discontinuance at any tine, as at present.C; 2. With respect to the JO'S prerequisite on elimination of the French in Cambodia, the Secretary stated that it was much too legalistic and unrealistic. It is the kind of thing that could get us into a great deal of complication without sufficient compensating advantages. He felt that this was the sort of problem which could bc only handled in time and by various methods. To attack it so directly would only create much more of a problem. Kenneth T.

In a recent cable (DA IN 105690) General J. Lawton Collins indicated that Premier Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam doos not have the capacity to unify the divided factions in Vietnam and that unless action is taken to achieve such unity the country will be lost to Communism. He further stated that if measures to strengthen the government were unacceptable to the U. S., or were unsuccessful, the U. S. should reevaluate its plans for assisting Southeast Asia. In addition, it is apparent that if the 1956 Vietnam elections are held, the Communists wil! probably emerge victorious. The political decision with respect to General Collins recommendation has not yet been made. 2. In message No. 2585 dated 24 December 1954 to the American Embassies in Paris and Saigon, the Secretary of State was more optimistic and expressed the view that progress had been made in South Vietnam during the past five months. 3. Referenced communications indicate a delicate and unstable situation within South Vietnam. Under these circumstances, it is necessary that the Department of Defense be prepared for any eventuality; hence it is prudent that all the implications of possible courses of action be examined. Accordingly, it is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff' submit their views and recommendations on the following points as well as any other which they deem appropriate. a. Assuming aid is cut off, the effect of this action upon the ability of the armed forces and the Government of Vietnam to maintain internal security in South Vietnam. b. Assuming minimal aid is to be given, the nature and extent of the military aid required, and the period for which it should be granted. c.

The revised programs extent to which these changed circumstances and will effect the discharge of U. S. obligations under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty. 4.

' 1. In response to your memorandum, dated 5 January 1955, subject as above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit the following views and recommendations. 2. In answer to the eight specific points raised in the above memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it appropriate, in view of the complexity of the problem and the difficulty of considering any of the questions in isolation, to forward a discussion of the points raised. This discussion is attached as the Appendix hereto. .3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the eight points mentioned involve only a portion of the over-all problem in an examination of the implications of possible courses of action. Accordingly, in response to your request to submit views and recommendations on any other points considered appropriate, the following courses of action are considered available to the United States in the light of the current situation in South Vietnam. a. To continue aid to South Vietnam as currently being developed with the cooperation of the French and Vietnamese. b. To institute a unilateral program of direct guidance to the Vietnamese government through an "advisory" system. Under this course of action, the amount of U.S. aid should be dependent upon Vietnamese adherence to U.S. direction. c. In the event the courses of action in subparagraphs a and b above, are not sufficient to insure retention of South Vietnam to the Free World, to deploy self-sustaining U.S. forces to South Vietnam, either unilaterally, or as a part of a Manila Pact force. 862      TOPS SENSITIVE d. To withdraw all U.S. support from South Vietnam and concentrate on saving the remainder of Southeast Asia. Included in the discussion attached hereto are some cf the advantages and disadvantages of each course. 4. Although national policy prescribes making every possible effort to prevent South Vietnam falling to the Communists, the degree to which the United States is willing to support this policy in men, money, materials, and acceptance of additional war risks is not readily apparent. Prior to consideration of military courses of action with respect to this area, a firm decision at national level as to implementation of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia is mandatory. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended previously against a "static" defense for this area and therefore reiterate the previously recommended adoption of a concept of offensive actions against the "military power of the aggressor".

Free Vietnams ultimate security lies in the military and moral support it may receive under the Manila Pact Strong affirmation by the signatories, to thc Manila Pact of their determination to react if hostilities were renewed in Indochina nay bc an essential factor in deterring the Viet Minh from launching an open attack. Moreover such a declaration would greatly strengthen the Diem GoVernments position. The Viet Minh have loft elements throughout South Vietnam which constitute a continuing threat to the nations security. On the other hand tho Viet Hinh have serious economic problems in the North semi-configcatory taxation and other acts of repression havc created much dissatisfaction. Knowledge of those adverse conditions oj? life in the North, as it reaches Tree Vietnam, is beginning to have a salutary effect on the attitudes of people in the South and may have considerable bearing on the election,, if they are held in 196. 'the Attitude and intentions There is considerable doubt in my mind as to the real intentions and objectives of France in Indochina. There is strong evidence that thc French faVor a new Vietnamese Government tchich will offer no serious resistance to the Viet Hinh -or- to French direction. Without French support, and that support is far from assured, the surViVal of Free Vietnam is problematical. c) Attitude and Intentions of the Sects religious armed groups called thc Cao Dai, Hoa Hao are anti-Communist in orientation, but feudalistic in all other respects. At present they have an Al Too Secret V e, r. The politico-and Binh Xuyen .      f f L effective veto power over government action. This povor they use to block reforms vhich might threaten their preferred military, economic ond political status". They will retain their power to threaten and harass the government until the National Army is strong enough to- neutralize their forces. d) Loyalty and Effectiveness of the Vietnsmc se Armed Forcer When 1 arrived in Vietnam thc Government was terrorized by a rebellious Chief cf Staff, General Hinh. Hinhs departure and dismissal shortly thereafter cleared the way for steps to render the Army subordinate to the Government. Diem now has a fair measure of control over thc armed forces. The Army is 9inE deployed throughout the country to carry out a so-called "Natlonal Security Action" program designed' to combat Viet I-Iinh infiltration' and restore civil government throughout the country. The Armys degree of effectiveness in executing this program Will have a decisiVe bearing on the success or failure of the Diem Government. It is too soon to predict whether Or not the National Security Action program will succeed but agreement by the United States to assume training responsibility and to grant financial aid to a reorganised and revitalized national army should have significant stabilizing effects. e) Economic Aspects of Free Vietnam Free Vietnam is capable of maintaining a viable economy, at modest levels. The territory is now self-sufficient in food and formerly produced a substantial rice export surplus. Rice and rubber are traditionally the principal sources of Vietnamese foreign exchange. As security improves, export availability of these, products should increase, thus contributing toward "stabilization of the economy. ,  i i f) Ability of Eicm to Secure Broad Popular Support; There is still a serious question in my mind as to whether Diem will be able to establish broad popular confidence in, and support for, his Government. However, he has enjoyed some recent successes in his dealings with the sects. This and his retention of actiue U.S. support have tended to enhance his prestige. However, Diem has much yet to learn about practical politics and public relations. 'While at times he corweys the impression of being well oyer his depth, recently he has evidenced greater flexibility in handling peo.ie and increased self-confidence in dealing with his ministers and public issues. On balance I believe that Diems integrity, strong nationalism, tenacity, and spiritual qualities render him the best available Prime Minister to lead Vietnam in its struggle against Communism. 2. In ordeh 'to assist the Diem Government to capitalize       Toi? Secret on its advantages and to overcome the obstacles to its success, 1 have directed the principal efforts of the United States in. Vietnam, in cooperation with the French,- toward aiding the Vietnamese, to develop and execute a series of emergency programs covering the military establishment, agrarian reform, refugee resettlement, fiscal management, and the establishment of a national. assembly. Some progress, of increasing momentum is being made in all these fields, with corresponding increase in the stability of the Government. The least successful aspect of my mission has been my failure thus far to induce Diem to bToaden his Government by including other able, experienced 1 aders, such as Dr. Phan Huy Quat, former Defense Minister. 3. Considering all factors, although the situation'in W etnam is not bright, I believe that if Diem has firm U.S. support and guidance and active French cooperation, or at least acquiescence, his Government.has a reasonable prospect of success. While the atmosphere in Saigon has improved demonstrably since NoVembcr, owing to the departure of General Hinh and thc backing which the United States Government has giVen to Diem, I have been unable to determine the extent of improvement in the countryside and villages of free Vietnam. There the Viet Minh will maintain a significant degree of control until thc National Security Action program is well advanced. Hor-eover, thc sects, although displayin. some uneasiness that their days of political, and financial independence may be numberody remain devoid of any of national conscience and still hove the capacity to do great harm, Likewise the prospect of national elections in 1956 hangs as a threat, over free Vietnam. This threat may reach the stage of crisis by July 1955, the period when under the GeneVa Accord the two sides are to begin discussions leading to elections. Nevertheless, in my judgment, there is at least an even chance that Victnhm can be saved from Communism if the present programs of its Government are fully implemented. k. n< Best available estimate of the costs for Cy 55 of financing programs of military and non-military aid that I recommend are lst Half 2nd Half Military $ 152.3 $ 130.9 lion-military he 2 583, Total Costs 206<i 189.2 Less Vietnamese Contribution 34->2 . 32 Remaining Requirement for U.S. Fundsyl72o3 5 15.0 b.

In View of the importance of Vietnam to all of Southeast Asia, I am co wl need that tho United States should expend the funds, materiel, and effort, required to strengthen the country and help it retain its independence. I cannot guarantee that Vietnam will remain free, even with our aid. But I know that without our aid Vietnam will surely be lost to Communism. If the chances of success are difficult to calculate, the results of a withdrawal of American aid are only too certain, not only in Vietnam but throughout Scut.'east Asia. Such a withdrawal would hasten the rate of Communist advances in the Far East as a Whole and could result in the loss of Southeast Asia to Communism. In my opinion, the cha we cannot afford to of success is not only worth the gamble free Vietnam go by default. Collins ' Special Representative of thc United States in Vietnam 0      I I Ml x.,...1 X < J SUPPLElFIT TG THE REPORT ON VIETNAM . by A GEN. J. LAWTON COLLINS- POST-CENEVA 011313 I'd yiETikiTg, a. Ori pin of the Cri sis. The immediate cause of the crisis in Vietnam Which reached an acute phase in thc fall of1954 was the Geneva Accord. This agreement ended seven years of war by dividing Ue country at the 17th parallel and awarded administration Oj. Tonkin and northern Annam to a Victorious Communist army and regime. Under French leadership Vietnam had participated in the war under conditions which tended to perpetuate the e sentid feci tunes of colonial rule. These conditions discouraged thc- growth of institutions which might have constituted a bulwark against the Viet i-Iinh in the South even after the enemy had prevailed militarily in the North. Vietnam emerged from the war with nominal independence, but this dxerted less popul&r appeal than the anti-colonial slogans of the Viet Minh. Its so-called National Army at thc moment of defeat was neither national nor.an army. Its civil administration was demoralized. Its government lacked effective control and was faced with the prospect of national elections in 1956 which could reunite the country under Communist con- )trol. HoweVer, this government, headed by Ngo Dinh Diem since June 1954, vns the first nationalist government of Vietnam and vith its moral force resolutely opposed thc Viet Minh.  ts=S b. Diem and his Opposition. (1) Because of its Eanti-Vitt Minh and nationalist character, the Diem Government was unpopular vith nearly the entire range of French officialdom. Some French elements hoped for an accommodation between North and South which would permit the French to continue to L do business with the entire country. Others nourished the illusion that 0 quasi-colonial regime could be established r and perpetuated in Cochinchina. Under pressure from both sides, the French Government through, its representatires in Paris, Washington and Saigon, made repeated representations r- to the U.S. Government, which had publicly stated its support of the Diem Government, to the effect that Diem he-.d had his chance, had failed, and should be replaced. Thc negative reply to these overtures was based on the U.S. contention that Diem, owing to circumstances beyond his control, had not had a real chancetd prove himself; that to replace him without- removing tire impediments to his success would only lead to another failure; and that the men suggested by the- French to 869 ' .     ri place Diem were unacceptable for being either French puppets or crypto-Viet Hinh. J (2) The opposition to Diem,, in addition to the Communists and a large element of the French, included the Chief of tic Victnumese General Staff and thc sectarian religious groups. These sects have long been more concerned with maintaining thcir priv te armies and domains than with vorking for the common national good. Thc sects finally joined the Diem Government, to protect their own interests. However, General Hinh, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, vtith some tacit support from the sects, precipitated a prolonged crisis by threatening for about two months To overthrow the Government by force. .Although this officer was a French citizen and a lieutenant colonel in the French Air Force, no effective French pressure was brought to bear on him to desist from threetuning the Government. On the contrary, it appeared that a Vietnamese Neguib (or Nasser) would not have been un-v-elcome to the French if he had been able to estcliish a military dictatorship responsive to French direction. c. Situation as of November 1954. (1) As of the date my mission arrived in Saigon, General Hinh, the Chief of Staff, continued to threatenthe Government, even though he hod been ordered by the Chief of State to proceed to France. Thc sects, although represented in the Government, were openly working toward their own objectives, without thought of the consequences of their action upon the nation. The Viet Minh were in cifctivc control of most of the rural areas and Villages under nominal authority of the National Government. French representatives '.Tre pressing for the early removal of Riem and hie replacement by one of their own stooges or else bv a Viet Minh, sympathizer who might reach some kind of under- t-ntfiug, perhaps tacit, with the- Viet Minh. The latter coursethey felt, would facilitate the work of Sainteny, then negotiating in Hanoi with the Viet Minh to the end that French businesses might continue to operate under normal conditions in Viet, i'inh territory. At the same time .the Government was faced with the crushing problem of moving, caring for end relocating anti-Ccmmunist refugees from the North who no?.f number nearly one-hall million and may in the end total one million. This undertaking, which could newer have succeeded without the devoted serVice of the French Army and the American Navy and the financial support of the U.S. GoVernment, will long tax the resources of the nation, involving asit does r one of the no. tsignificant population movements of moderntimes.870'       L E E (2) From nearly every point of view, "free Vietnam appeared headed toward absorption by thc Viet i'inh, whether through a French-managed accommodation vith the Com-muriists or through the restoration of a scarcely-veiled colonial systtn in South Vietnam which could have been sus-tair-d against thc Viet Minh only by the weight of arms which, paradoxically, the French had made clear they had no intention of using. 2. PUnFQSr OF COLLI? 3 Ml SSI ON. In his letter of November 1, 1954, instructing me to undertake a special mission to Vietnam, the President said he was ordering me to Saigon for a limited period to coordinate end direct U.S. activities in Vietnam in support of U.S. policy objectives. To that end, he gave me broad authority to direct, utilize and control all agencies of the U.S. Government in that country. My immediate task was to attempt to check a rapidly deter-iorc.ting situation in Vietnam and to help Diems Government establish internal security and political stability throughout its territories. Thc emergency, rather than the long-range, aspects of U.S. policy in Vietnam were designated the principal task of my mission. ri  c  . L 3 8 EVEN? QIN T PR 0 C-R AM. a. 1 was soon impressed vth the fact that the National Army was the key to success or it lure in Vietnam. The Army was under the command of an avowed enemy of the Diem Government. So long as thc Government could not rely on the Army, it was powerless not only , against th& General Staff but also against the sects, each with its private army and special interests, and even more importantly against the Viet Minh who stood in a fair way to win Vietnam south of the !7th parallel through subversion. Accordingly, my initial efforts were directed toward preparing recommendations on the National Army which had to be dealt with before any of thc other urgent problems of Vietnam could be solved. Fortunately, shortly after my arrival, General Hinh obeyed thc- orders Bao Dai htad been prevailed upon to issue, and left Vietnam for France, as I had urged him to do. Hinhs departure removed some of the aspects-of crisis from the National Army progrant but did not rob it of its importance as the nations most urgent problem. b. In accord with the French Commissioner General Ely, 1 proceeded thereafter to draw up a seven-point program of action to which I proposed to devote the limited period of my mission in Vietnam. I had consulted Ely in detail as this program was being drawn up, end had obtained his con-' currence and the cooperation of his staff members who worked      closely with mine. Cur Clone collaboration was confirmed in recon, er by the secretary of Stete antLthe French Prentier after" their meeting in FJashingtonThe seven-point program we evolved was as follows (1) Vietnamese Armed Forces (a) .rccment to be reached with French and Vietnamese on .the size, composition and mission of thc forces. (b) Assumption by HAjAQ of .full responsibility for training Vietnamese Armed Forces. (c) Full autonomy to be granted to Vietnamese Armed Forces. (d) National Army support, and subordination to, Vietnamese Government to be assured. (e) Employment of National Army in National Security Action (pacification and .anti-subVersion program). (2) Strengthening and broadening of Diem Government.. (3) Relocation of refugees and their absorption into the national economy. (f) Agrarian reform, particularly those phases designed to get refugees onto the land and restore all unbilled lands to cultivation. (5) Establishment of a National Assembly. (6) Financial and economic measures designed to strengthen the economy, meet U.S. requirements for receiving direct American aid and to support other points of the program. (7) Education and training, particularly in the field of public administration. d. it was agreed that as progress was achieved in each field a calculated effort would be made to give major credit to President Diem for such progress. Diem .Would make the public announcements through an improved and expanded Vietnamese Public Information Service. 1 charged the chief of our USIS with'the implementation of this most important aspect of our program.      -5- 4-5 hi." rx, n  4- PROGRESS IN II-PI-oNTIHG SEVEI-FOINT PRCC-RAM. a. -Vietnnricse Armed Forces.' (i) Un December 13 General Ely and 1 agreed on a force structure for the Vietnamese Armed Forces and on the assumption by MAAG of full responsibility for" training these forces under the OVerall authority o.C the Commander-in-Chief in Indochina. Delay by the French Government in approving our agreement on this subject has held up implc-mentettion of this aspect of the program. ' (2) The same agreement referred to above provides that the Vietnamese Armed Forces will be fully autonomous, that is staffed and commanded solely by Vietnamese officers, by July 1, 1955' ' f  r L C n ' c 1 E 1 C . (3) Additionally, on January 19, 1 reached agreement with President Diem and the Vietnamese Minister of National Defense on a slightly modified force structure and on a program for reorganization of the Vietnamese Armed Forces, in which General Ely concurred. This agreement is contained in an exchange of letters between the Vietnamese Government and me. >  (4-) The structure of the Vietnamese Armed Forces (shown in Enclosure A) is designed to accomplish a two-fold mission the establishment and maintenance of internal security; and thc capability of providing sufficient initial re-sistancc to external attack to prerent the country from being rapidly overrun before outside assistance can be brought to bear. To Accomplish these missions the Army is to be organized into six divisions; three territorial divisions, essentially existing regional commands; and three field divisions to constitute a mobile battle corps to reinforce proVincial units end proVide e delaying shield in eVent of aggression. (5) This structure is based on the concept that a relatively small force, properly trained, equipped and led, can perform the abate missions more effectively and at less cost than a larger force which would be disproportionate to the economic and manpower capacities of the country. In any case, the Viet Minh enemy, backed by its Coninunist Chinese ally, could always maintain the capability of matching and exceeding whateVer number oi divisions free Vietnam could put into the field(6) Thus the Vietnamese Armed Forces described aboVC, end the concept upon which their structure is based, do not in themselVes insure the security of free Vietnam in the event of external attack. Such security must depend ultimately on the Manila P.act Powers and the action they would. 873      be prepared to take, to which Vietnamese forces themselves 1- would-make a vital contribution .  .   (7) Significant progress has been made in attaining National Army su;port of, and subordination to, the Vietnamese Jovemhent following the departure of General Minh.' While it may be too early to say that the National Army is now in tilt, senses the military arm of the. goVernment, I believe L that this aspect of the urogram is on the right path and with p tient application will be fully realized(8) The deployment of the territorial force- of the national Army to thc provinces has already begun. The o' jectives and methods of the National Security Action Program h-.ve been explained to military and civil authorities having responsibilities throughout the country. This program too is of long range character and .rill take some months to execute. A good start has been made. a i b. Strengthenin', and Broadening- of Diem Government. Little progress has been made toward strengthening and broadening L the Diem Cover me nt. This failure, is attributable to the fact that more than half of the present 'cabinet ministers represent the sccts and are opposed to accepting into the cabinet any man who might threaten their position there or thc place of their respective sect in the society. Prime Minister Diem contends that he wishes to broaden his Government but dares not do so until the National Army has been rendered capable of neutralizing c the private'military forces of the sects. The failure of Diem to accept Dr. Phan Huy Quat in the GoVernment was a major r- set-back. Thore is still' an urgent need for an effective Minister of the Interior, and the Ministries of Information and Agriculture particularly need strengthening. Considerable  improvement has resulted from the appointment of Ho Thong Minh as Defense Minister and Diems relinquishment to him of authority 4- to direct and control thc Defense Ministry. The new Commissioner of Refugees, rham Van Huy on, also represents an improvement. I fear that no further progress on this front, howeVer, Will L be made for some time to come. r Relocation of Refugees. This is likewise a long range and complex problem." It has been under urgent study by members of USGM and the appropriate ministries of the C-overn-nent. Some progress has been made in developing plans to absor-b the hundreds of thousands of refugees into the productive f life of the nation, particularly in the field of agriculture. r d. Agrarian Reform. President Diem intends to announce in his hew Years message 7 January 2h) an agrarian reform program L . f " . ; 874 ' ' l  .     f-)  r  f r r L L L covering landlord-tenant relationships, conditions of land tenure, and an emergency program whereby refugees and military personnel demobilized as a result of the reduction in the Armed Forces can be placed, upon land abandoned by its owners dr not now in use. Tile program Will pro Vido that "after three years, if certain conditions are met, thc refugees can obtain permanent possession of the land on which they are placed. p. Es t abl i shm ent o f a I la t i o n al A s s er fol, y. Vietnamese experts have oraTtcd, aud with tne close cooperation of members of thenbassy staff, revised a decree establishing a national assemb.y. This assembly will bc provisional, will have some elective character, and Will have only limited powers. This assembly will prepare for thc later establishment of a const!-tuent assembly but Wil1 i t s elf have no constituent powers. This point is important since to establish the permanent form of the government necessarily involves defining the role of the present Chief of tate Bao Dai. Th inclination of the present government is tc throw over Bao Dai, but I feel that as long as the national government is unable to cope with the sects and other splinter groups without his aid, it would be both premature and dangerous to rcmove Bao Dai from his position as Chief of State. f. Financial and Economic' Measure. s to Sti eng then the Economy. (1) Vietnam now has its own national bank and is independent of the previous quadripartite system. American experts of the USOM and Embassy staffs arc working With Vietnamese Government officials to establish procedures acceptable to the United States with' regard to foreign exchange, import, controls, and related matters. Much time has been consumed in explaining American requirements but thc Vietnamese officials have displayed good'will and I belieVe- that they will meet our objectives in this regard. (2) During CY 199, tax receipts of the national government of Vietnam will be approximately 1139 million, cf Which fill 6 million will hove to be used for ordinary civilian expenditures of the government. This surplus on the civilian side of the budget, dlus borrowing and other extraordinary receipts of the national government, will permit the Vietnamese Government to contribute approximately 068 million to the extraordinary expenditures of the GoVernment, including military, refugees, and economic aid. The balance of necessary expenditure of approximately 0327 million will have to be met by United State aid. For FY 196 it is estimated that receipts will increase and expenditures decline, so that aid needed Will decline to approximately t28 million. CO 01 .     f t f E C  (3) Requirements for United States economic aid ere expected to increase from approximately U3!. million in . FY 1955 to ido million in CV 195, and to' 466 million in FV 196, or at approximate doubling from FY 1955 t'o FY 1956. The major increase is in transportation and communications, with smaller increases in agriculture, education and public administration, and public health. (If) As shown by the above figures, during 1955 aid 1996, economic aid re uirements will increase and military aid requirements will decrease.

PROBS;;-' OF THE SECTS. The normal problems of a divided country are enormously comnlicate'd by the existence in free Vietnam of two religious sect? (Cao Dai and Hoa Hao) and a powerful band of "nationalistic" free-booters (Binh Xuyen). Each of tnese groups is rendered dangerous by its possession of armed forcos and its control of a considerable portion of the national territory. The sects and the Birth Xuyen, although they have ah various times clayed an anti-French role, are vestiges of the colonial- policy of divide and rule. While no reliable statistics are available, thpse groups claim to embrace about one-tenth of the population of free Vietnam and to have forces variously ermed totalling hr090,000. Thc French have incorporated some thousands of these armed forces into their Expeditionary Corps and hr-.vc pro Viced the financial means for the perpetuation of tho sects as semi-independent principalities. French subsidies to the sects, however, Which haVe steadily diminished over recent months, will, according to General Ely, bo entirely suspended as of January 31. This dcvelopment, while dangerous in the immediate future, is of long range advantage to the Vietnamese Government in that it offers thc opportunity, if properly exploited, to end once and for all the acute threat of the sects to an orderlv central governent. Lacking French support the sects will be obliged to turn to the national government. If the government handles then skillfully, they can bo brought into line and shorn of their power to create serious trouble. However, if the government does not proceed cautiously i'n this natter, there is a possibility that the sects, or fragments of them, may resort to open banditry at 'a' time when the national government and army are not prepared to meet this new menace    6. U.S. RELATIONS wITd FRENCH III VIETNAM. One of the crucial roquiremonts of U.S. policy and operations in Vietnam -is to determine precisely -.chat French intentions toward the country arc. It is clear that the French-in Vietnam do not speak With a single voice. I hate entire confidence in the integrity of General Ely and have no doubt that he believes what he has said to me curing the ocurse of cur association in Saigon. However, the presehce in Ilanoi of the Sainteny mission, the conversation I had with Sjainteny in Elys presence, and excellent analyses made by our Embassy in Paris, lead me to believe that enoral Ely is not the sole representative in Vietnam of the French Govemn.arit, This viev is reinforced by a continuing and undisguised trench desire to renove Prime Minister Diem .in favor of one of their own candidates. I believe that the Fre .ch are preparing tWO possible courses of action a. If free Vietnam, should be taken over by the Communists, the French Wish to bc prepared to make a deal with Ho Chi i-linh in order to continue trade and cultural relations with Ho under some form of- "co-existence". b. If, on the other hand, free Vietnam, largely through U.S. aid and support of the-. Manila Pact, can be saved as an indeendent state, thc French still Wish to retain their special economic and cultural status, claim a large measure of credit for such success, and thus, perhaps, hold free Vietnam in the French Union. The French Government, however, is still undecided as to tho outcome, and so testers back and forth between these two policies. I feel that our government should have this matter out with the French Government once, and for-all, Witn full and faithful support from the French, Diem has a fair chance of success. without such support, particularly if instead thcre should be covert obstructionism from the French in the form, of support of rival leaders, perhaps with Bao Dais connivence, Diems chances will be materially lessened. 7 PRIME MI LISTER DIEM, a. Diems virtues lie in his. widely acknowledged proKiTy "and nationalism. His disadvantages as a head of government are his lack of executive experience, his conspiratorial past Which tends to make him suspicious of those who do not onenly support him, his. naive- trust in those willing to flatter his ego", his lack of xnoW hon" in selling himself to his people, his narrowness of view, his tendency to exaggerate his Insight into the problems of Vietnam, and his great stubbornness. Moreover Diem has surrounded himself with members of his family whose defects tend to intensify rather than offset his own,      -10 r b. However, since my arrival in.Saigon I hate observed some improvement in Diem's conduct of public affairs, and I believe .tr th continued staunch American support he may be able to . It should be noted that thc problems he faces Would daunt t experienced statesman. No one else is in sight at the time wlo could usefully replace Diem. However, as a last resort, it may become necessary to call upon the personal presence and support of Bao Dai to enable Diem to. solve the complex problem of his relations with the sects and-the ultimate position of these grows in the national society. This would have to be done, hovtover unde certain guarantees, firmly agreed to in adVance by Bao Dai, as indicated in pertinent telegrams I have sent the Department. p      S >s > .

These additional costs will be   (1) The financial support given by the Vietnamese Govrh-inent to the sects, which Will increase when the French c ase t.xeir financial support of the sects on 31 January-1955. Diem will probably have to continue the subsidies he now gives the sects and' assume at least part of the sttpport now provided by the French for the time being, and until he is in a post-t' m politically and militarily to cut off their subsidies. It is difficult to estimate the amount of support the Viet-' names Government will feel required to furnish. However, based on present Vietnamese and French payment figures a total of a. proximately dp, 000, 000 nay be required in FY 196. iKpenditord of this sum would reduce the Vietnamese contribution to its own military end economic aid programs and in-arease the requirement for U.S. funds accordingly for Ff 1996. (2) Another incalculable cost will arise if the refugee evacuation toward the end of the 300-day period (May, 1955) exceeds expectations. There may be a requirement for an additional 119,000,000 in this fields 1 therefore recommend that the cost estimates cited as requirements for U<S. funds be considered as minimum figures, and that sufficient additional funds on the order of 120,000,000 be made available for FY 1956 to permit flexibility in coping with thc above contingencies, if necessary    L BACKGROUND..AND.SUMMARY 1. General Collins will be present to discuss his written report of 20 January 1955 (seo TAB A). The principal points in this report are a. Because Free Vietnam security lies in the military and moral support it may resolve under the Manila Pact, the determination to react in the event of a renewal of hostilities in Indochina should be strongly affirmed by the signa- tories at the forthcoming Bangkok conference. b. There is a real doubt as to French intentions and objectives in Indochina. Although General Ely is cooperative in Free Vietnam, the Saintony mission in north Vietnam appears eager to coexist' with the Communists. The U. S. Government should have this matter out with the French Government once and for all. c. Diem is the best available Prime Minister. d. The principle efforts of the U. S. at present are to aid the Vietnamese to develop and execute a series of emergency programs covering the military establishment, agrarian reform, refugee resettlement, fiscal management, and the establishment of a rational assembly. Agreement by the U. S. to assure training responsibility and to grant financial aid to a reorganized and revitalized national army should have a stabilizing effect. e. The prospect of national elections in 1956 hangs as a threat over Free Vietnam. f. The U. S. should expand the funds, material, and effort required to strengthen the country and help it retain its independence. Without our aid, Vietnam will surely be lost to Communism. If Diem has firm U. S. support and guidance, and French cooperation, he has a reasonable prospect for success. This chance of success is well worth the gamble. COMMENTS 2. The Planning Board has discussed the report, and the following are its comments a. It concurs in the desirability of a strong affirmation at Bangkok of allied determination to imploment the Manila Pact, should the need arise. b. The State Department contends that we have had this matter out with the French at various high-level conferences and that the French have agreed in principle to our position in writing. The Planning Board believes we should      now insist that the French implement this agreement, in practice as well as in prirciple,in all respects. For example, we should insist that they remove the expensive FOA-financed machinery from the coal minas north of Hanoi. This mine plays a largo role in the economy of the area, providing power for the region, and at present is being worked by the Communists for their benefit. Despite French assurances, nothing is being dons to remove the machinery. c. It concurs that Diem is probably the best available Prime Minister. d. It concurs in the present emergency subject to screening in detail by the departments and agencies concerned. e. It concurs that guidance regarding the 1956 elections is necessary and that this should be developed and sent to General Collins within the next month or six weeks. r f. It concurs in the order of magnitude of the cost to the U. S. of the military and non military for CY 55 ($327.3 million) and CY 56 ($195.6 million). There appears to ba no insurmountable obstacles to the financing of these programs. The force goals for thc Vietnamese armed forces have already been approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. RECOMMENDATIONS ..3. It is recommended that a. You approve the report of General Collins and express the apprecia-tion of the DOD for his work in Indochina. b. You support the Planning Board positions regarding the above major points in the event the Council is asked to act on them.      t . MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE L ' Subject Concept and Plans for the Implementation, f if Necennary, of Article IV, 1, of the L Manila Pact. 1. This Is in response to.a memorandum by th' Deputy Secretary of Defense, dated 6 January 1955, rubjcct an above, in Which it was requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff 'eOcammend a concept and broad outline plants for the application of U.S. military povcv under the Manila Pact with a primary objectiVe being the deterrence of . overt aggression by China or other Communist nations." 2. Thore are three basic forms in which aggronoion in South-p cant Ania can occur; a. OVert armed attack from outside of the area. b. OVevt armed attack from within the area of each of . the Sovereign States. c. Aggression other than armed, i.e., political Warfare. E or subversion. 3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff conalder that their viem pvo-L Viously exprenned in a rtemornnciitm for the Secretary of Defense, ' elated 8 October 1954, rubject 'llllltary Consultation Under the E Southeast Ania Collective Defense Treaty," in v;hlch the Joint Chief of Staff stated that 'U.S. ccrmilmcnts to FoToSa, Japan and Korea, Which natleno have been excluded from the treaty, r make it imperative that the United States not be rm trio, ted by force co;iltmcntG in the Subject treaty area" remain Valid. U. Tn order to retain thin frocuom of action it la conaidored Ethat the United Staten should not enter into ccmblned r.lllio.vy planning for the defenne of the treaty area with the other'. I'-ntla fact pdA-mn nor should Ootailn of Uni tact SUtton tin 5.1atoval plnnS for military'action in the crent of Coruniat nggtconton in Southeaot Ania be disclosed to the other powora.     5. Honed on the aboVe cons.idcratlong, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the following as a concept and broad outline pltli for the application of U.S. military power under the- Manila Pac t a. Continued oevelofncnt of combat effoctlVe indigenous forces, with their structure and training mutually coordinated to develop local lendevtshlp and prcstigc, and with lnproVcd capabilities to create a cohesive fighting force through integration of their operations with adjacent indigenous forces and with support by operations of forces of other Manila Pact members. b. Readiness to retaliate promptly vtluh attacks by the most effective combination of U.S. armed forcers against the military potter of the aggressor. S. Encouragement of other Ubnila Pact countviea to maintain forces in rcadineaS to counter aggression. cU DiOCVGSicn, in general terms, of unilateral military plans by the Illlitary Representatives to the Council to the extent neccrsavy to InatH-e-maximum participation and cocporation by other member nations but'not to the extent that U.S. Strategic plane or the availability of U.S. forces for implementing cuch plans might be reVcaled. c. Periodic visits by U.S. forces into the area ao demonstrations of intent, and for joint and combined training . exercises. f. Availability of appropriate mcchanibm for the employment of U.S. forces in support of friendly indigenous forces in the general area. 6. The concept of prompt retaliatory attacks does not enVisage attacks on targets within the aggressor country other than, on military, targets involved in the direct ruppovt of the ngg'cesSor action. If authorized, atomic veaponn mould be uned, even in a local situation, if such une will bring the aggression to a swift and posltive cesc-ntlon, and if, on a balance of political and military consideration, such use will bent adVance U.S. Security interests. Under the alternatiVe assumption that authority to use atomic Weapons cannot be asnuved, the aboVe concept would not require change, but this assumption would not permit the roost effective employment of U.S. armed forceo, and consequently might require greater forces them the U.S. would be Justified in proViaing from the over-all point of view. E r I.      . 7. In the event general wav should develop, U.S. forces Will be deployed indicated in emergency war plans, and with the i . principal effort d .'Voted tostrategic areas considered more vital than Southeast Asia. Honevcv, should aggvcssion vcsu.lt in r a prolonged localized conflict of limited objectives,, additional U.S. forces couJd be deployed to the area if required. The application of thin additional U.S. nUitary power, in conjunc- . tion with the military poWev of other, Fer.tbov nations of the Manila Pact, Would involve the movement, deployment, and support c of U.S. forces not v.ithin presently approved force levels, and t j mobilization of the defense effort of the Manila Pact nations. In oxder for the United States to support this additional effort, the mill tary budget and personnel ceilings vould require conoidenable increaaea. t i 8. The abovc ccnnidevations are baced on currently planned U.S. military capabilities end on the eunumption that the United r- Statea will not enter into specific agreements with other Manila Pact countries in regard to corrAttm.cn t dr earmarking of U.S. forcen for employment in the Southeast Asia area or Western Pacific. Such a position rill permit the United States, in the event of further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia, freedom of action in determining th'e type of U.S. forces to bo employed and the method of their employment, and can be no implemented 03 to retain the support of member nations of the , Manila Pact and other friendly or neutral countries in the general area. It must be fully understood that the United States cannot guarantee the territorial integrity of any mcmber nation, but nt moot can help secure the independence of tbote countries whore peoples desire it and who are willing to underr- take the reSponSibilities of self-government.. 9. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that oucceco in imple-. menting the above concept will be dependent on the resolution With Which future U.S. decisions concerning the Urmila Fact are made and envvied out. HowoVer, frequent pronouncements by high government officials to insure better public understanding of our object!Ven and nccecnavy coursea of action will materially Iassist in obtaining success. For the Joint Chiefs of Staff     By NWD Date 201 I DEPARTCENT OF DEFENSE CONTRIBUTION TO Department of Defense contribution to and participation in the Bangkok Conference consisted of two phases of activity.- the prclitni-ary phase and the conference phase. During the preliminary phase the Department of Defense provided nenbership on the International Working Group which net in Washington during the period 30 November .19547 February 1955 In addition to representatives of the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, the t-ambership of the International Working Group consisted of the Ambas-sadoi's of the seven other signatory countries who, in turn, were supported by their political and military advisers. The primary function of the International Working Group was to develop and give consideration to the problems which would be discus-cod at the Bangkok Conference, and to agree upon an agenda to be submitted for the approval of the Council. The report of the Working Croup in the form of a proposed agenda was completed cn 7 February and submitted to the Council for consideration at the first closed session of the Council Conference, at Bangkok, on 23 February 1955 (TAB A) During this pcricd, the Department of Defense drafted, and obtained agrecment of the International working Group to the position paper on the organisation of the Military Advisers to the Council Members which Was adopted by the Council at Bangkok. (TAB B) Further, prepared nine considered of These were as during this preliminary phase, the Department of Defense position pippers for the U.S. Delegation cn matters primary Department of Defense interest.

U.S. position on the Ucc of Military Forces to Supprcss Subversive Activities Combined Commands for Forces of the SEACDT Countries Military Advisers to the Council of the Manila Pact The positions outlined in the above papers with the exception of that pertaining to the initial meeting of the SEACDT Council Military Advisers (TAB G), provided adequate guidance to the U.S. Delegation. As a question of tactics, and in order to offset pressures by the Asian signatories for a NATO-type organization, the Defense Reprcsen- tative proposed to the Secretary of State, prior to the first closed session, that thc U.S. take the initiative and recommend a meeting of the Military Advisers during the Bangkok Conference. This proposal was acccpted by the Secretary of State. During the second or conference phase, it became obvious that the Asian nations signatory to thc Treaty would strive for a U.S. commitment of forces for the defense of the Treaty area. Again as a question of tactics, and in order to providc thc assurance that those countries were sceking with respect to U.S. intentions regarding the defensc of the Treaty area against Communist aggression, thc Dcfcnse Representative proposed to the Secretary of State that he clearly outline such U.S. intentions and provide information as to US'., forces currently stationed in the Far East as a deterrent to Communist aggression. Thc Sccrctary of State accepted this proposal and in his remarks at thc first closed .session of the Conference on 23 February, stated the U.S. intentions so specifically that the anticipated forcing tactics on the part of thc Asian nations in relation to this matter did not develop. All of thc Council members, with the excertion of Hr. Bonnet of France acccpted the Military Advisers paper with minor, revisions. Howcvcr, the French Delegation took exception to certain terminology used in outlining the functions and responsibilities of thc Military Advisers on the basis that this terminology was not easily translatable into French. It subsequently became obvious that the question of semantics was not the primary cause for conccrn on the part of the French but that they were disturbcd ovcr what might be construcd by the French Government as a French delegation agrccrccnt to force commitments within the scope of the planning responsibilities of the Military Advisers. During the period between thc morning and afternoon session, the French and U.S. Delegations, on an ad hoc basis and with D-fense representatives of both countries participating, revised the language of the Military Advisers' paper in order to overcome French apprehension. Thc revised paper was later accepted by all members of the Council and thc Military Advisers immediately convened in a scparatc closed session    v . SECRET . V The Military Adviser to thc host country, Ge neral Jira Vichitsonggrara .presided but .after opening the meeting proposed that he vacate the chair in favor cf thc Military Adviser of the United Kingdom delegation, Field Marshall Sir John Harding, the senior officer prescnt. With the concur-, rence of the other Military Advisers, Field Marshall Harding accepted. An a matter of tactics it had been agreed within the U.S. Delegation that Admiral Stump would, in his opening remarks, demonstrate U.S. sincerity in aiding in the determination of mathods for the implementation , of the SEACDT by taking the initiative in arranging for an early conference of the Military Advisers Staff Planners to be followed by an early meeting of the Military Advisers. A copy of Admiral Stamps opening remarks is attached as TAB L.  L During tnis initial mceting of the Military Advisers, agreement was reached on thc following matters  Dates and locations of the first meetings of the Military Advisers and Staff Planners Agenda for first meetings of Staff Planners and Military Advisers Responsibility for preparation of position papers Procedural arrangements Communique EThc Philippine Military Adviser during this initial meeting pro-posed that a military organization similar to that of NATO be establishcd for coordination of military action within the Treaty Area. However, the Philippine Military Adviser acceded to the unanimous rcquest of the other Military Advisers that this matter be included on the agenda as a matter appropriate for consideration by the Staff Planners at their first meeting. L The second and final meeting of the Military Advisers was held on 25 February and was notable for the same degree of unanimity which existed at the first mooting. A record of decisions reached at this meeting is attached as TAB M. r In conclusion, it is considered that U.S. military objectives wore attaincd during the conference. H-vever, it is further considered that there will be two major factors, with military implications, to contend with in future,meetings of the Military Advisors or Staff Planners. They are 890 SECRET      The obvious desire'of the Asian nations to establish a NATO-type SEACDT organization with everything that it implies in the ' nature of force commitmentsThe obvious anxiety on thc part of the French pcrtaining to ccmnitments of to participate in any type in support of the SEACDT yet their desire ell policy and planning activitics.

We have been working on problem of elections in Viet-Nam, in great detail over last several weeks, NSC has asked Department submit policy for consideration by mid-April and we sure that elections will be discussed during proposed U.S.-French talks Washington April 20. The British have offered give us their views on elections prior these talks. We feel best solution is for us be in position inform French British our views prior talks and believe it best we can nut such forward as support of policy of Free Viet-Nam rather than as unilateral U.S. recommendations. Our proposal is based on Edens plan put forward at Berlin-Conference ' for all German elections and has already been approved by France for use Germany and rejected by the Communists. The basic principle is that Free Viet-Nam will insist to the Viet Minh that unless agreement is first reached by the latter's acceptance of the safeguards spelled out, that no repeat no further discussions are possible regarding the type of elections, the issues to be voted on or any other factors. After we have Diems general acceptance we can proceed inform UK and France of this plan which we think only formula which ensures both satisfactory response to Geneva Agreement and at same time plan which is unassailable in intent but probably unacceptable to Communists because of provisions for strict compliance to ensure genuinely free elections. END FYI. v ..      r ' ? ' J S' " b 'I 2 <;a CmUhlt. 1 r L f  ! E 1  f f L You should speak to Diem privately regarding elections,vithout showing him formula outlined next telegram. We are not now attempting secure his approval as such to our position but to assure he understands our viewpoint and accepts it to degree we can proceed with French British on broad assumption Free Viet-Nams position similar our own. Believe best way accomplish this is to remind him of his and foreign % ministers conversations with Secretary on this subject and to continue that in specific cases of elections in Korea and Germany Free World has stood I firm on issue of guarantees of genuine free elections, supervised by body having authority guarantee elements free elections PARER outlined last paragraph following telegram UNPAREN. In. each case Communists have refused accept these safeguards which we think basic and fundamental. We believe unless such guarantees previously agreed upon would be dangerous for Free Viet-Nam be drawn into further discussions of other issues of election. I e Ask Diem if we can assume our thinking is alike on this point. Since time exceedingly important, hope we can have affirmative answer soonest.

TRANSFER NATIONAL POLICE AND SURETE FROM BINH XUYEN. TWO POSSIBLE METHODS OF DOING THIS DEPENDING ON WHETHER OBJECTIVE IS TO SAVE FACE FOR DIEM OR BINH XUYEN, POINT ABOUT LATTER BEING TO SECURE THEIR PEACEFUL COOPERATION WITH NEW GOVERNMENT. A. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR DIEM TO RESIGN AND PREVENT BINH XUYEN FROM CLAIMING VICTORY IN PRESENT CRISIS, WE WOULD INSIST AS PRIOR CONDITION ON TRANSFER OF POLICE TO GOVERNMENT BY ORDINANCE ISSUED BY DIEM, BUT OPENLY SUPPORTED BY BAO DAI AND POSSIBLY FRENCH AND U.S. HIBLIC SUPPORT BY BAO DAI PROBABLY ESSENTIAL TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED. IN THIS CASE BINH XUYEN MIGHT BE FORCED TO BOW BUT MIGHT TRY TO SABOTAGE NEW GOVERNMENT IN VARIETY OF WAYS. (I SHOULD NOTE THAT FRENCH FULL OPPOSE THIS STEP. ALTHOUGH HE ONCE FAVORED IT, ELY HAS NOW SAID HE COULD NOT AGREE TO IT. FRENCH FEAR BLOODSHED IF BINH XUYEN LOSE CONTROL OF POLICE UNDER DIEM AND BELIEVE NEW PRIME MINISTER SHOULD HAVE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE OF REGAINING CONTROL OF POLICE FOR GOVERNMENT). B. IN ORDER INDUCE COOPERATION OF BINH XUYEN WITH NEW GOVERNMENT, IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLE TO OFFER BAY VIEN A CHANCE TO SAVE FACE BY HIS "VOLUNTARILY" PROPOSING THAT CONTROL OF POLICE BE TRANSFERRED TO NEW GOVERNMENT.

DO SAID HE FELT THAT WITH PROPER APPROACH, THIS MIGHT WELL BE POSSIBLE. HE INSISTS IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR DIEM TO ACHIEVE THIS. DO FULLY AGREES THAT ANY NEW GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OVER POLICE CONTROLS, BUT FEELS STRONGLY THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SHOULD BE DONE TO SECURE COOPERATION OF BINH XUYEN WITH NEW GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE THAT IF BAY VIEN WERE CONVINCED AHEAD OF TIME THAT U.S., FRANCE, BAO DAI AND ANY NEW PREMIER WOULD INSIST ON GOVERNMENT TAKING OVER POLICE, HE MISHT WELL AGREE TO MAKE THIS OFFER HIMSELF. I BELIEVE THIS METHOD PREFERABLE TO 1A ABOVE UNLESS WASHINGTON FEELS DIEM'S PRESTIGE AND PERHAPS OUR OWN MUST BE PROTECTED BY FOLLOWING METHOD 1A. 2. PERSUADE DIEM TO RESIGN, OR IF HE REFUSES, HAVE BAO DAI RELIEVE HIM. A. BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE RESIGNATION BY DIEM. IF METHOD 1A ABOVE IS FOLLOWED, DIEM COULD BOW OUT SOMEWHAT GRACEFULLY "IN ORDER TO HEAL THE WOUNDS" CAUSED BY RECENT EVENTS. WE COULD POSSIBLY DRAFT A STATEMENT FOR HIM. B. DISTASTEFUL AS IT WOULD BE TO USE BAO DAI IF DIEM WILL NOT RESIGN, I SEE NO OTHER LEGAL METHOD OF REPLACING HIM. C. FOR TIMING AS TO NOTIFICATION OF DIEM, SEEPARAGRAPH 3F BELCW3.

THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE THROUGH PARIS. D. BAO DAI WOULD THEN SUMMON THE NOMINEE TO PARIS FOR CONSULTATION. IF POSSIBLE, THIS SHOULD BE DONE SECRETLY. IF QUAT WERE THE CHOICE, IT MIGHT BE DONE WITHOUT A LEAK SINCE HE HAS MADE A COUPLE OF TRIPS TO PARIS WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. E.

THESE CONSULTATIONS SHOULD COMMENCE WITH DISCUSSIONS WITH ELY AND ME, WHO WOULD INFORM HIM AS TO NATURE CF PROGRAMS W1UCH U.S. AND FRANCE WOULD SUPPORT. ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, HE COULD THEN PROCEED WITH CONVERSATIONS WITH PROSPECTIVE MINISTERS, REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES, AND LEADERS OF THE SECTS. F. I FEEL THAT AS SOON AS NOMINEE HAS ACCEPTED, DIEM SHOULD BE INVITED BY BAO DAI TO RESIGN OR ELSE BE RELIEVED. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD DIEM BE TOLD OF PLAN BEFORE FRENCH AND U.S. HAVE APPROACHED BAO DAI AND GAINED HIS ASSENT TO INFORM HIM COULD GIVE HIM DAMAGING MATERIAL FOR HIS "WHITE PAPER". EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE BY BAO DAI TO HAVE DIEM REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR IS PREPARED TO TAKE OVER.

WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN PREPARING A STATEMENT WHICH HE MIGHT ISSUE AS INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 2A ABOVE. 4. REACH AGREEMENT BETWEEN U.S., FRANCE, AND NEW PRESIDENT ON PROGRAM FOR SOLUTION OF SECT POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROBLEMS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT AN AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE REACHED BETWEEN ELY, THE NEW PRESIDENT, AND MYSElff, ON A PROGRAM FOR SOLUTION OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY PROBLEMS OF THE SECTS. THIS WOULD REQUIRE A PRIOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN FRENCH AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS ALONG THE LINES OF OUR PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN EMBASSY TELEGRAM 4373. THESE PROPOSALS ARE BEING ACTIVELY STUDIED NOW BY GENERAL ELY'S STAFF. WE EXPECT TO COME TO AGREEMENT HERE WITHIN 48 HOURS. APPROVAL WILL STILL BE REQUIRED FROM WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY AS TO ADDED COSTS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN THE INDUCTION OF MORE SECT PERSONNEL THAN ORIGINALLY COUNTEMPLATED, SEVERANCE PAY FOR SECT PERSONNEL TO BE DEMOBILIZED, AND LARGER AVERAGE STRENGTH OF ARMED FORCES FOR FY 1955, CAUSED BY SLOW-DOWN IN DISCHARGE OF VIETNAMESE ARMY PERSONNEL AS A RESULT OF PRESENT SECT CRISIS. 5. OBTAIN AGREEMENT OF SECTS TO PROPOSED SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEMS. A. NEXT STEP WOULD PROBABLY BE FOR NEW PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH LEADERS OF SECTS AND OBTAIN THEIR AGREEMENT TO SOLUTION ARRIVED AT UNDER PARAGRAPH 4 ABOVE. HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE CLEAR TO SECTS THAT THIS WAS BEST PROGRAM THEY COULD POSSIBLY OBTAIN AND THAT IT WAS ONLY WAY TO CONTINUE AMERICAN AND FRENCH FINANCIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT, WITHOUT WHICH THE COUNTRY COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SAVED FROM VIET MINH AI COMMUNISM WHICH SECTS PROFESS TO DETEST.

SUCH AN APPOINTMENT WOULD BE FATAL AND IT'MUST BE MADE CLEAR TO NEW PRESIDENT THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD WE AGREE TO THIS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BINH XUYEN WOULD SETTLE FOR SOME ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR COMMERCIAL VENTURES.

OWING HIS SPECIAL SENSE OF MISSION, DIEM WILL PROBABLY PUT UP WHATEVER RESISTANCE HE CAN TO BEING REMOVED, BUT I DOUBT HE WILL FIND SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT IN ANY QUARTER. IN END HE WILL PROBABLY RETIRE IN OUTRAGE FROM SCENE AND VOICE HIS PROTESTS AGAINST BAO DAI, FRANCE AND U.S. IN SOME KIND OF "WHITE PAPER" A. CERTAIN VIETNAMESE NATIONALISTS WOULD SEIZE ON DIEM'S REMOVAL TO FAN ANTI-FRENCH SENTIMENT, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE DIEM'S REMOVAL WOULD RESULT IN POPULAR VIOLENCE AGAINST FRENCH EXCEPT POSSIBLY SPORADIC INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS. B. I BELIEVE DIEM WOULD ULTIMATELY ACCEPT REMOVAL AS STATED PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE. I THINK HE IS TRUE PATRIOT AND WOULD NOT TRY SABOTAGE CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM OF NEW GOVERNMENT. I DO NOT AGREE THAT HE STILL HAS "CONSIDERABLE POWER" EXCEPT SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND U.S. I HAVE TRIED TO CONVEY TO DEPARTMENT HOW SLENDER BASIS OF DIEM'S PRESENT SUPPORT NOW IS. IF FRENCH AND U.S. SUPPORT IS WITHDRAWN, DIEM TOLL BE HARD PRESSED TO MUSTER ANY ALLIES, AND FEW IF ANY OF THESE ARE LIKELY TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE IN HIS SUPPORT. 3. NATIONAL ARMY LOYALTY, WHICH DIEM DOES NOT FULLY COMMAND, IS NOT COMPLETELYTRANSFERRABLE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, ARMY LOYALTY COULD BE SECURED BY NEW GOVERNMENT MORE BROADLY BASED, NOT RIVEN BY POLITICAL JEALOUSIES AND CRISES LIKE DIEM REGIME, AND FULLY BACKED BY FRANCE AND U.S. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL BATTALION COMMANDERS IN CENTER VIET NAM WHO MIGHT LEAD GROUPS OFMEN TO DEFECT.

IT SHOULD BE SAID HERE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD GENERAL MINH BE ALLOWED RETURN TO VIET NAM NON. HE RETAINS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN ARMY AND COULD BECOME ONCE AGAIN MAJOR DISRUPTIVE INFLUENCE. 4. COMPILATION OF ASSETS OF STRENGTH DIEM FAY HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE. WITH RESPECT TO POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN CENTER VIET NAM, THIS HAS BEEN FALLING OFF PARTLY AS RESULT OF POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF DIEMS BROTHER NGO DINH CAN, AND OPPOSITION HAS TAKEN FORM FOR EXAMPLE OF RECENT INCIDENTS AT BA LANG. THERE IS NO PROPER GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT OF ANY LEADER IN VIET NAM, LEAVING ASIDE HO CHI MINH. DIEMS VIRTUES AS ANTI-FRENCH LEADER HAVE BEEN TARNISHED BY HIS I DEPENDENCE ON HIS BROTHERS WHICH HAS LED TO QUITE GENERAL FEELING THAT A NGO FAMILY DICTATORSHIP IS IN EFFECT BEING ESTABLISHED. FEW NATIONALISTS OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY AND IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE WOULD LIF A FINGER IN DIEM'S DEFENSE. HOW GREAT HIS FOLLOWING IS IN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IS HARD TO SAY. DIEM HIMSELF CLAIMS HIS SUPPORT IN CENTER, FOR EXAMPLE, COMES LARGELY FROM NON-CATHOLICS. IN ANY EVENT CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IS NOT POLITICALLY ORGANIZED AND REPRESENTS LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF POPULATION. CERTAINLY MANY REFUGEES FROM NORTH WERE ATTRACTED BY FACT CATHOLIC HEADS GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH, BUT POLITICAL AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF REFUGEES IS ONLY A POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOITATION AT A LATER DATE. IN NATIONAL ARMY, SCARCELY ANY LEADERS ARE ENTIRELY PRO-DIEM, EVEN CHIEF OF STAFF TY; SOME ARE HOSTILE, AND THE MAJORITY ARE PROBABLY NO MORE THAN LUKE-WARM. I BELIEVE THERE IS NO REASON TO ANTICIPATE SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTION IN ARMY AT LARGE. IF DIEM IS REMOVED THROUGH ORDERLY PROCESSES. 5. VIET MINH REACTION TO DIEM'S REMOVAL WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE TO EFFECT THAT FREE WORLD HAD SUFFERED DAMAGING SETBACK. APART FROM STEPPED-UP PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AND PUBLIC GLOATING OVER DEFEAT OF AN ENEMY, I DO NOT BELIEVE VIET MINH REACTION WOULD BE DANGEROUS. IN OTHER WORDS, I DO NOT ANTICIPATE VIET MINH WOULD ATTEMPT TAKE MILITARY ADVANTAGE OF DIEM'S REMOVAL. HOWEVER, VIET MINH, PLAYING MANY ANGLES AS USUAL, MIGHT ATTEMPT BUILD UP ANTI-FRENCH AND ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT, CHARGING OVERTHROW OF NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT TO FRENCH AND U.S. "IMPERIALISTS."

IT WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO MAKE CHANGE AFTER BANDUNG TN ORDER AVOID GIVING VIET MINH PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE FOR EXPLOITATION AT CONFERENCE. HOWEVER, SINCE DIEM IS STILL THREATENING TO TAKE INDEPENDENT ACTION TO REMOVE SANG AFTER EASTER WEEKEND, OVER STRONG FRENCH OBJECTIONS, IT MAY BE DESIRABLE EFFECT CHANGE AS SOON AS U.S. AND FRENCH HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON CASE TO BE PRESENTED TO BAO DAI. WHILE I RECOGNIZE DIFFICULTIES THIS CRISIS CREATES FOR U.S. IN VIEW OF OUR WELL-KNOWN ASSOCIATION WITH DIEM, I FEAR CONTINUED DELAY WILL LEAD TO EVEN GRAVER PROBLEMS OF DETERIORATING FRENCH-U.S. COOPERATION IN VIET NAM, INTENSIFICATION OF CIVIL DISORDERS CULMINATING, POSSIBLY, IN CIVIL WAR, AND NOT IMPROBABLE ULTIMATE LOSS OF ALL VIETNAM TO VIET MINH. THIS EVENTUALITY WOULD BE DAMAGING NOT ONLY TO U.S. PRESTIGE BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM CONVINCED, TO U.S. SECURITY. MECHANICS OF POSSIBLE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I ABOVE. 7. OUR AGREEMENT TO REPLACEMENT OF DIEM ADMITTEDLY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO AMERICAN AND WORLD PRESS. I WOULD SUGGEST SOMETHING ALONG FOLLOWING LINES A. DIEM HAD MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO HIS COUNTRY AT A TIME WHEN HIS PARTICULAR QUALITIES WERE MOST VALUABLE. HE MAINTAINED CALM AFTER GENEVA, CONTRIBUTED TO EXODUS OF REFUGEES FROM NORTH WITH ITS GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT, SUCCESSFULLY MUSTERED WORLD OPINION IN SUPPORT OF AID TO THESE REFUGEES AND WITH SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND U.S. DEVELOPED SOUND AND PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY ; 905 PERMANENT  v RECORD COPY      r.raiO lTi IF  V j- I ;  t  -2- 4448, APRIL 9, 10P.M.

PERHAPS IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS WOULD DEVELOP DEVISIVE INFLUENCES AMONG THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM, WHO HAVE ONLY RECENTLY GAINED THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY HAVE HAD LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN MEETING THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS WHICH THEY FACE, SUCH AS RECONCILING DIFFERENT INTERESTS OF SECTS AND VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN CLASHES OF PERSONALITY, WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE CURRENT CRISIS, INVOLVING THE "UNIFIED FRONT" ORGANIZATION. RESULTANT BLOODSHED, EVEN THOUGH NOT EXTENSIVE, HAS CREATED DEEP WOUNDS WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR PRESENT GOVERNMENT TO HEAL. C. DIEM WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO TAKE INTO HIS GOVERNMENT MEMBERS OF VARIOUS OPPOSITION PARTIES. ONLY WITH BROAD SUPPORT CAN THE PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMS DEVELOPED BY DIEM BE MADE EFFECTIVE. THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS,HEADED BY A MAN WHO HAS HAD EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND WHOSE PERSONALITY IS SUCH THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET OTHER STRONG MEN TO WORK WITH HIM. HE HAS ADOPTED THE SAME BASIC PROGRAMS WHICH DIEM INITIATED ATO WHICH HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF BOTH U.S. AND FRANCE. DECISION AS TO WHO SHOULD HEAD GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM IS, OF COURSE, ONE TO BE MADE BY THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE UNDER THEIR OWN SYSTEM. WHILE CHANGE IN PRESIDENCY INVOLVES TEMPORARY LOSS TO VIETNAM OF A GREAT NATIONALIST LEADER, IT DOES NOT IN ANY SENSE MEAN A CHANGE IN THE POLICIES OF HIS GOVERNMENT WHICH HAVE DRAWN U.S. SUPPORT. WITH THIS SUPPORT AND THE COOPERATION OF ALL ELEMENTS OF VIETNAM, THE COUNTRY CAN BE SAVED FROM COMMUNISM. KIDDER LFS32 . Note Read by Mr. Yound (PSA) 230 p.m. 4955 FMH 906 , ( I' prMr'iTnC  J LI V d I I I V      TOP W T i 4511 2 DEPARTMENT OF STATE r SENT TO Amembassy SAIGON NIACT 4438 Apr 9 1955 LIES ONLY AMBASSADOR FROM SECRETARY Have this morning discussed situation with highest authority. We are disposed to back whatever your final decision is but before you a tually finalize we want to be sure you have-weighed all of the factors which concern us here. We feel that what has happened does not reveal anything new about Diem but rather a basic and dangerous misunderstanding as between France and the U.S. We have always known the qualities which Diem possesses and those which he lacks. Nevertheless our two countries agreed to support him in default of anyone possessing better qualifications. The only alternatives now suggested are the same persons who were regarded as unacceptable substitutes some months ago. What has happened is that whereas the United States has been proceeding on the assumption that Diem would be backed as against any who might challenge him assuming that he had the capability, apparently the French have given their support only on the assumption that the Binh Xuyen would also be supported on an autonomous authority and that when they challenged Diem he would not be allowed to use force to assert his authority over it. We can appreciate the reluctance of the French to see force used but if it cannot bemused then what is the point of our supporting at great cost the national army which I thought it had been agreed was primarily to be an army for domestic security rather than an army to fight external aggression L       r L  r E f C f r C-L I 1 I. 1 1 1 t L L 1 ' U.S. recognizes that Cao,Dai and even the Hoa Hao are genuine sects with cultural religious and political roots which cannot be forcibly torn up without grave consequences which should be avoided but we do not believe that any central government can exist as more than a figurehead if it does not have control over the national police and if this control is farmed out to a gang which exploits its privileges to protect vice on a vastly profitable scale and which exists by virtue of the backing of the self-exiled Bao Dai and the French. We cannot see that replacement of Diem by any persons you mentioned will of itself correct this situation and indeed we have had the impression that Quat was less acceptable to thc sects than is Diem. There are two other factors to be-borne in mind. One is that it is widely known that Diem has so far existed by reason of U.S. support despite French reluctance. If, however, when the showdown ccmes the French view prevails then that will gravely weakne our influence for the future both in Vietnam and elsewhere. Removal of Diem under these circumstances may well be interpreted in Vietnam and Asia as example of U.S. paying lip service to nationalist cause and then forsaking true nationalist leader when QUOTE colonial interests UNQUOTE put enough pressure on us. The French constantly assert that the U.S. has a primary responsibility in this part of the world but it is difficult to have responsibility without authority. In essence, will not the ouster of Diem on the present conditions mean that from now on we will be merely paying the bill and the French will be calling the tune. Any successor of Diem will clearly know where the real authority lies. COPY       I E t I L i J b si The second factor is that there will be very strong opposition in the Congress to supporting the situation in Indochina generally and Vietnam in particular if Diem is replaced under existing circumstances. We do not say that this opposition may not in the last .instance be overcome, par-ticularly if you personally can make a case before the Congressional com-mi ttees but Mansfield who is looked upon with great respect by his colleagues with reference to this matter, is adamantly opposed to abandonment of Diem under present conditions. I wonder whether there is not some intermediate C c f E. solution between the present extremes now discussed and that Diem can be allowed to regain his damaged prestige by an assertion of authority over the Binh Xuyen and at the same time other elements be brought into the government under conditions which will assure a real delegation of authority. I feel that as with most Orientals Diem must be highly suspicious of what is going on about him and that this suspicion exaggerates his natural disposition to be secretive and untrustful. If he ever realIy felt that the French and ourselves were solidly behind him might he not really broaden his government? We must I think have some sympathy for his predicament as he is constantly called QUOTE the Diem experiment UNQUOTE.  t In conclusion I want to reaffirm the very great confidence which we all have in you and in your judgment. You have done and are doing a wonderful job in the face of tremendous difficulties. Your 4448 has just arrived in Department but is not yet decoded. We will comment on it in subsequent telegram.

BAO DAI NOW BELIEVES THAT THE BINH XUYEN MUST GO EVENTUALLY BUT THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF REMOVING THEM FROM THE SCENE UNDER THE STRESS OF THE PRESENT CRISIS BY SIMPLY ISSUING A DECREE TO THAT EFFECT. THE DECREE WOULD BE IGNORED AND BAO DAI'S AUTHORITY LOST. DIEM HAD BEGGED FOR. FULL POWERS AND HAD TOLD BAO DAI THAT IT WAS WHAT THE UNITED STATES WANTED HIM TO HAVE. BAO DAI HAD GRANTED THEM AGAINST HIS ADVISORS. NOW DIEM IS INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING EVEN WITH THESE POWERS AND WISHES BAO DAI TO DO SO FOR HIM BY DECREE. IF BAO DAI WERE TO DO SO, HE WOULD BE EXPENDING HIS AUTHORITY FOR A CAUSE WHICH IS ALREADY LOST, WHICH HE IS UNWILLING TO DO. DIEM HAS NOT THE MILITARY OR POLITICAL STRENGTH TO CARRY OUT HIS ORDERS BY FORCE, AND IF HE ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS THE BINH XUYEN IN THAT MANNER, IT WILL LEAD TO CIVIL WAR WHICH WOULD IN BAO DAI'S OPINION RESULT IN FREE VIETNAM PASSING UNDER VIET MINH CONTROL IN SHORT ORDER. EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO BACK THE GOVERNMENT TO THE EXTENT OF FORCING THE BINH XUYEN OUT OF THE SAIGON POLICE (PRESUMABLY WITH OUTSIDE AID FROM THE FRENCH OR THE UNITED STATES), IT WOULD RESULT IN DIEM BECOMING "EMPEROR OF SAIGON" AND WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY UNDER CONTROL OF LOCAL SECT TROOPS AND, EVENTUALLY, OF THE VIET MINH. DE QUOTED BAO DAI'S SOURCES IN SAIGON AS REPORTING DIEM'S STRENGTH AS A "MOCKERY". AFTER THIS PROLONGED EXPOSE, WE ASKED DE WHAT BAO DAI THOUGHT SHOULD BE DONE. HE REPLIED THAT THE UNTIED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD ARRIVE AT AN IMMEDIATE AGREEMENT WITH THE FRENCH TO CREATE SOME FORM OF GOVERNING BODY WHICH COULD TAKE OVER PERMANENT v  910 THE EXECUTIVE RECORD COPY       S;"JiSlTjVF -2- 4396, APRIL 9, 5 PM (SECTION'THREE OF FOUR), FROM PARIS THE EXECUTIVE ROLE OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. WE ASKED HIM TO BE MORE PRECISE AND HE STATED THAT HE HAD IN MIND A FORM OF "SUPREME COUNCIL" OR "COUNCIL OF ELDERS" win CH WOULD SERVE AS A GOVERNING BODY. IT WOULD FUNCTION UNDER BAO DAIS OVERALL DIRECTION AS CHIEF OF STATE, BUT WOULD ENJOY THE SAME POWERS NOW ENJOYED BY DIEM. BAO DAIS CHIEF FJNCTION WOULD BE THAT OF "SUPREME ARBITRATOR". THE COUNCIL ULD HAVE TO INCLUDE. IF IT WERE TO BE EFFECTIVE, REPRE-SENTATION OF ALL (ALL) FACTIONS IN VIETNAM INCLUDING THE CATHOLICS WHO MIGHT DECIDE THAT DIEM IS THE BEST QUALIFIED MAN TO REPRESENT THEM. WE ASKED WHETHER IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE OUNCIL WOULD REPLACE THE GOVERNMENT OR SIMPLY ACT IN CON- JUNCTION WITH IT AND DE SAID THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE THOUGHT THAT BAO DAIS THOUGHTS WERE ALONG THE LATTER LINES BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT. THE ONE RESTRICTION OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE THAT ALL ITS MEMBERS BE ANTI-COMMUNIST. WE ASKED WHETHER BAO DAI HAD ANY VIEWS ON RETURNING TO VIETNAM AND WERE TOLD THAT HE HAD NONE FOR THE MOMENT BUT WAS PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING THAT WE AND THE FRENCH FELT WOULD HELP TOWARD A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. DE STATED THAT BAO DAI HAD WANTED TO RETURN MANY TIMES DURING RECENT MONTHS WHEN IT BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT DIEM WAS INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY DIEM HEMSELF WHO ARGUED THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS OPPOSED TO BAO DAIS RETURN AND THAT IT WOULD BE INADVISABLE FOR HIM TO COME BACK FOR THERE WAS GREAT OPPOSITION TO HIM IN VIETNAM AND THAT HE, DIEM, WAS "PRESERVING BAO DAI'S INTEREST". BAO . DAI WAS NOT IMPRESSED BY ANY OF THESE ARGUMENTS EXCEPT THAT THE UNITED STATES DID NOT WISH HIM TO RETURN, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED TO HIM BY LA CHAMBRE. HE HAD NOT PRESSED THE ISSUE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT, AS IN THE BINH CASE, HE MIGHT ACTUALLY WIELD MORE INFLUENCE FROM AFAR WHERE HE WAS REMOVED FROM PETTY LOCAL SQUABBLES AND COULD EXERCISE HIS AUTHORITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AS HE HAD IN THE HINH CASE.

I ASKED ELY HOW HE COULD PROVE SUCH IS WILL OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE IN ABSENCE OF ANY ASSEMBLY. STATEMENT CAN ONLY REPRESENT ELYS ESTIMATE. HE REPLIED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE WISH TO BE RID OF DIEM.

I REPLIED THAT CRISIS HAD BEEN CAUSED BY SECT MINORITY LOOKING AFTER OWN SELFISH INTERESTS. SAME GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM UNDER ANOTHER PRIME MINISTER WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE LED TO OPPOSITION FROM SECTS.

ELY SAID HE KNEW HE COULD NOT PROVE HIS STATEMENT, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT TO MAINTAIN DIEM AGAINST POPULAR WILL WOULD BE TO DIMINISH VALIDITY OF EXPRESSION OF POPULAR WILL WHEN ELECTIONS BECOME POSSIBLE. I SAID THAT, ON CONTRARY, MODIFIED THOAI PROPOSAL WO0LD WORK ONLY IF ACCEPTED BY CONSIDERABLE BODY OF VIETNAMESE OPINION. (#) BAO DAI IS FRANCO-U.S. CHOICE. I SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER PROPOSAL WOULD WORK, THAT I INTENDED TO HAVE FURTHER CONSULTATIONS TODAY AND ONLY ASKED ELY NOT TO PREJUDGE OUTCOME. ELY SAID THAT, IN HIS VIEW, NO SOLUTION COULD APPEAR TO BE MORE MARKED AS FRANCO-U.S. SOLUTION THAN MAINTENANCE OF DIEM. I SAID I COULD NOT AGREE WITH THIS SINCE PLAN WOULD NOT WORK UNLESS GOOD MANY VIETNAMESE AGREED TO IT. 8. ELY SAID THAT HE MUST MARK THIS AS A POINT OF DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US SINCE IF PLAN DID WORK IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF MY PUTTING PRESSURE ON VIETNAMESE. I AGREED THAT THOAI PROPOSAL, AS MODIFIED, WOULD WORK ONLY IF U.S. AND FRANCE BACKED IT, AND IF THE BASIC ELEMENTS WERE AGREED TO BY DIEM, DO, QUAT ET AL AND BY BINH XUYEN. I REMINDED HIM WASIUNGTON HAD NOT YET AGREED TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FROM DIEM, AND THAT IF IT DID AGREE TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT, SUCH WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR SECRETARY AND ME TO EXPLAIN TO AMERICAN PEOPLE. ELY SAID HE WAS UNABLE TO SEE HOW ANYONE WAS JUSTIFIED IN MAINTAINING DIEM IN OFFICE AGAINST BEST JUDGMENT OF PEOPLE ON THE SPOT. WITH RESPECT TO POSSIBLE WORKING OUT OF PROPOSAL, I TOLD ELY MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD VOTE DIEM OUT OF OFFICE UNLESS HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO CHANGE HIS METHODS OF OPERATION. ELY SAID THIS WAS A DIFFERENCE OF POINT OF VIEW BETWEEN US, EXPLAINED BY FACT THAT HE HAS SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO CRISIS WHICH HE FEELS CANNOT BE SOLVED AS LONG AS DIEM IS IN OFFICE.

Refer to 1-126915 22 April 1955 Dear Walter I refer to the current situation in South Vietnam and the probable necessity for review of the basic policy in that area. An analysis of the problems has been made by my staff in the attached staff study. I think it is an excellent study and I highly recommend you and your staff read it. while I realize these problems have no easy solution, to me the basic issues are quite clear. I believe there are three major areas of weakness in South Vietnam as follows a. The need for a solution of the problem of how we can achieve our ends in South Vietnam and yet live with the French. b. The need for a solution of how we can achieve internal order with particular reference to the sects, the lack of internal communications, and the lack of strength in the central government. (During my recent trip I conferred with Diem at which time he stated that if his government could become strong he felt the people would rally to it, and that at present Ho Chi Minh offered the only strong rallying point to the people of South Vietnam.)' c. The need for a solution of how we can achieve a suitable government of South Vietnam, with particular reference to its relationship to Bao Dai, the broadening of its base, and the participation of capable people within the government. (I feel that in the past we have made a mistake in building the government upon one man.) In view of the probable nature of the problems to be discussed with General Collins during his visit, I consider that this information may be of value to you. Sincerely yours, (SIGNED) H.

The difficulties inherent in developing, implementing and sustaining a program designed to produce a stable, viable government in South Viet-Nam, under the limitations imposed by current U.S. national policy, are recognized. However, recent recommendations from the field for revision of such programs must be considered in the nature of delaying or interim actions which can % be justified only if they are undertaken with a positive objective, i.e., to gain time for consolidation or development of a favorable situation in the same area of elsewhere. Although proposed interim notions in Viet-Nam may be justifiable from the point of view of mi nimi ng the psychological impact of the eventual loss of the remainder of Viet-Nam to the Communist Bloc, it is considered that ultimate failure of U.S. policy in Viet-Nam, -even though limited by the extent of the U.S. commitment, would have the effect of furthering the loss of U.S. prestige in Asia. SUBCONCLUSION Interim or delaying actions in South Viet-Nam should be accompanied by development of a favorable situation in the remainder of the Far East in general and in Southeast Asia in particular as pertains to Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. 2. The implementation of current U.S. policy and programs in South Viet-Nam and to a great extent in Cambodia and Laos is effected by the ability of the French to negate within these countries the accompllshment of U.S. objectives. The complex and flexible policies currently being followed by the French will not insure the continued cooperation and support necessary for the succe'ssful accomplishment of U.S. programs. France is pledged to and is supporting a policy of internal sovereignty for the Copy 6 o f 4 c opi e s 927 . W SOW SENSITIVE     NND 63.316.  Associated States, with full independence within the French Union. The French Union is an ultra-national, commonwealth-type arrangement, as yet loosely defined and subject to further legal development. The statements of French leaders to the effect that "France intends to maintain its presence in the Far East" allude to the concept of the French Union. Further, the French are capable of negating U.S. programs by (a) working to bring about the downfall of the Diem Government through an internal coup or through influencing Bao Dai to dismiss Diem; (b) refusing to cooperate in the training of the Vietnamese Army; (c) withdrawing completely from Indochina, thus forcing the U.S. to increase suhstantial 1 y its political, financial and military commitments in the area; (d) unilaterally reaching a rapproachement with the Viet-Minh; and (e) insisting on executing their obligations under the Geneva Agreement by working towards holding the elections now scheduled for July, 1956. The basic factors on French policy with regard to Indochina are x. an as follows (a) The French desire to maintain a maximum of influence in Indochina. (b) The French believe, because of their financial investment and their historical position in Indochina, that their interests should be the determining factor in political developments in Indochina and they are Jealous of what they regard as'U.S. intervention. (c) French acceptance of the Geneva Accords recognized their military inability to defeat the Viet-Minh, and the consequent need for a political settlement of the Indochina problem on a basis which would minimize French V political, commercial, and prestige losses resulting from such a settlement. Copy o f copi e s. 928 SENSITIVE I      .   NND 63.316.  (j) In the final analysis, they will retain a position of flexibility in order to follow whichever course o'f action appears most likely to assure them the most advantageous position, whether that should be to continue to support U.S. policy, to seek a rapprochement with the Viet-Minh, or to withdraw completely from Viet-Nam. SUBCC'CLUSION The successful accomplishment of U.S. programs for South Viet-Nam cannot be assured through French implementation of such programs as tl t French will only accept the concept of these programs insofar as they further French policy in the area. I 3. Bao Dai, in his position as Chief of State, has the authority to f appoint or dismiss the Cabinet in Viet-Nam at any time. His attitude has recently been favorable to the U.S. but his, vulnerability to the influcence i ' and intrigue of the French and anti-Diem Vietnamese could sway him at any time to dismiss Diem and eliminate the Government on whose existence the U.S. predicates its policies. This factor tends to weaken the basis on which current U.S. programs are established. SUBCONCLUSION The influence of Bao Dai in his position of Chief of State is a constant menace to the successful implementation of U.S. programs in South Viet-Nam. 4. Diem has proven to be an individual who, in addition to being guilty of nepotism in his government and of being reluctant to utilize the capabilities of some of the more dynamic Vietnamese personalities available to him, has demonstrated a marked inability to understand the political, economic and military problems associated with Viet-Nam. The concept of making U.S. support dependent exclusively on Diems continuance in power is not valid 930      L DO c. -th OiE CCLT-'J to portray hii.i as being inLlisncnsablc, Which should not be 11, U continued undcr rticularly if a more dynamic, ticl pprcstigc) were placed, in control capable leader (albeit Former Foreign Minister j should. he given adequate itbirawir.g U S. support should, not be If the Diem cxpcrimcnt faile, and not consider continual support to South Viet-Nam a; of action which would, be adopted. of a Communist take over in These include effort licit would work out a settlement' with the on orations to hinder the consolidation of Cc-u control; to develop ant and (d) other political. ir se programs of to tn mist government should be given a-ieev a t c 1 C cannot longer reasonably support Dien nted. on in recent corn on t. n coursej of action available in r  Section 3 3    relation to.these dissident factions it is bovious that their only considcration r elation to the National. err a retention of power and.

Should they do so, l tiierc is no reason to doubt at this time that they would win easily in the' . 1956 elections  In connection with the above, thc issue of unification would be a popular ' r ' ' ' eno in Vict-Naa, despite thc probable consequences of Conunict dominationIt would be dangerous to assume that South Viet-Nam would reject . unification with the North. The South Vietnamese Government will not be opcrating in a propaganda vacuum in tho South; Viet-Minh propaganda is .still more intensive and successful than that of the Dicu Government. Further, r I. there is no guarantce taut the paeplc of thc South will reject unification, particularly if the referendum is relatively free and supervised by an international commission. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the people of the north would approve unification under any circumstances which r Ik t r will prevido them with the opportunity to take ovcr thc territory of the South, politically, ccor.ouicolly and. militarily.

DATE April 30, 1955 FROM PSAKenneth T. Young, Jr. SUBJECT Report on Collins Visit and Viet-Nam Situation . 1. Collins arrived Thursday, April 21, and left early Friday morning, April 29. He had lunch with the President-April 22, saw the Secretary for the first time at a long luncheon meeting April 25. We also met with the Secretary Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We spent all day Friday, April 22, meeting with Collins with Defense and CIA represented. He reiterated even more vigorously and firmly his view, strongly backed by Sturm, that Diem must be replaced and that a plan of action should go into effect immediately. They both favored Quat. None of the questions or alternate considerations expressed by any of us at that or any subsequent meetir-s changed Collins view. Monday morning, April 25,' we had a working meeting with him at which I proposed basic question, do we or do we not support some political change in Saigon, and (b) a specific plan of change. The reports at that time from Saigon showed Diem was steadily slipping. In the fa.ce of the adamant view of Collins and Sturm most of us reluctantly accepted the nced for a change, but we all insisted that we stay with Diem at least for the first innings. Collins and particularly Sturm, rejected our proposition in any shape or form. The basic shift in our approach was taken at a long luncheon meeting with the Secretary. Unfortunately neither Bob Hoey nor I were invited to attend. Bill Sebald can fill you in on this. The Secretary took the position we would support Diem until and unless genuinely Vietnamese elements turned up with another acceptable solution. Collins and Sturm later told the working group this was an impossible condition. 2. The rest of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday we spent working up two long and complicated telegrams to Paris and Saigon; At a full meeting with the Secretary, Mr. Hoover and Allen Dulles late Tuesday afternoon they were approved. Collins fully endorsed these telegrams after he and Sturm had eliminated our proposal to try again to keep Diem as head of a coalition government. These telcgrams envisaged a gradual and rather complicated shift of our position in carefully worked out stages. As we suspected at the time, they were immediately overtaken by events. None of us really . believed in them but we were faced with Collins strong recommendations and the fact that he had been to the White House the first day after his arrival. In any event, this shift has never been carried out. Although the telegrams were sent to Paris and Saigon, we have put out a stop order holding up action on them indefinitely3. Wednesday, April 27, Diem changed the police- chiefs and Thursday the Binh Xuyen began military action against the government. Ely and the French have been putting the full blame for this situation on Diem, as they tried to do for the Mar-ch 29-30 incident. Events have moved very      4 v A 'L -A'I f 2 rapidly since then. The national army has seemed to be winning, groups are rallying to Diem, Bao Dai is getting set to fire Diem, and the French have in effect withdrawn their support from Diem. All reports from Saigon indicate there is a revolutionary feeling developing against Bao Dai and the French. Some of this is instigated by the Diem group but some of it may be spontaneous. As of this writing, we may be faced with a choice between Diem and Bao Dai. In view of the fighting, we have felt in State it was best to continue support for the government under Diem and see what happens. But as this crisis develops we are being forced to take a more and more unequivocal and strong stand, for Diem. 4. Senator Mansfield issued a long statement in support of Diem on April 29. If Diem is forced out, Mansfield would have us stop all aid to Viet-Nam except of a humanatarian nature. Senators Knowland and Humphrey have also backed Diem. A large number of members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee after hearing Collins have informed the Department through Congresswoman Kelly that they would not favor the State Department withdrawing support from Diem. Collins met with the Far East Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, separately with Senator Mansfield and with about a dozen of the House Committee. While he and Sturm felt these legislators would give no trouble, Sturm informing us after seeing Senator Mansfield that there was nothing to it, Bob Hoey and the rest of us here were much less sanguine about legislative feeling. In fact there is going to be real difficulties on the Hi.11 if Diem is forced out by what appears to be French-Bao Dai action. 5. During the past ten days the French have been quiet with us, but working behind the scene. Kidder reports Ely as almost hysterical. Bao Dai has been active, as he has submitted one plan to us and has also taken another action publicly. Both of these are almost identical with plans or ideas which French officials had submitted to us several weeks ago. If there were any notion that Bao Dad acts independently of the French and Ely, that should now be dispelled. However, Prime Minister Faure has indicated to Dillon that he does have no stomach for going off independently of the US in Free Viet-Nam. They will follow our lead even though they dont like the idea, providing the situation is not so bad in Saigon that they have to move out French military and civilian personnel. We have asked for pretty fundamental reassurances on basic French intentions in Viet-Nam, we got them orajly for whatever they may be worth. 6. We are in a bewildering, fluid situation. I believe more strongly than ever that we should stick with Diem now. Collins says he is a terrible administrator and it will wreck Free Viet-Nam if we leave him in. That may . be true but that is not the issue at present. If Diem can lead the nationalist forces to a conclusive settlement, even to the point .of rendering Bao Dai ineffective or annulled, we should continue to support him. The key questions are M  41047 U 3 t.      a) Will the Vietnamese National Aniy as a group stick with . Diem? b) Will the Binh Xuyen be broken up into isolated remnants? c) Will enough nationalist groups including sect leaders rally to the government even against Bao Dai? d) will Bao Dai fire Diem, even if the answers to the above three questions are clearly enough in the affirmative. what I am afraid of is that the combination of continuing forces coalesced around Diem on the one hand and Bao Dai on the other may not enjoy preponderant strength. 7. There are possibly serious anti-French overtones in the Vietnamese political situation. These also include anti-Bao Dai feelings. We must not take any action which would tar us "with the same accusations. General ODaniel, our three Attaches, and Lansdale informed us on April 30th that "any change in leadership or command at this time could result in chaos". 8. There are some personal aspects that I would like to take up with you privately. 41048 FEPSAKTYoungJr;c st      FE BVR 3S jUR JR o FROM!

WE POINTED OUT THAT THIS DECISION WOULD CCME AS GREAT SHOCK TO AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION WHO LOOKED UPON HINH AS REBEL AGAINST GOVERNMENT. HE HAD HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM SAIGON FOR THAT REASON. IT WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A SIGN THAT BAO DAI W. ! SENDING HINH AS MEANS UPSETTLING NATIONAL ARMYS LOYALTY TO GOVERNMENT. BAO DAI SAID THESE WERE INTERPRETATIONS HE COULD NOT HELP AND THAT CIRCUMSTANCES NO LONGER PERMITTED HIM TO BE INFLUENCED BY THEM. FACT WAS, HE SAID, THAT HINH ENJOYED MOST SI PPORT IN VIETNAM MILITARY CIRCLES OF ANY VIETNAMESE GENERAL. HE HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM VIETNAM BY BAO DAI AT CUR REQUEST IN ORDER GIVE DIEM FREE HAND IN ESTABLISHING HIS AUTHORITY OVER THE ARMY AND IN REESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER AND A GOVERNMENT OF NATL UNION. BAO DAI REMOVAL OF HIM WAS BEST EXAMPLE OF EXTENT OF EFFORT TO GIVE DIEM EVERY CHANCE. DIEM HAD CONSISTENTLY FAILED. NOW IT WAS BAO DAIS PURPOSE TO END PRESENT BLOODSHED BY REMOVING DIEM FROM SCENE AND THUS PREVENTING NATIONAL ARMY FROM TAKING FURTHER ARMED ACTION. AT SAME TIME, HE MUST MAKE CERTAIN THAT SECTS WOULD DESIST FROM SIMILAR ARMED ACTION. HE HAD ALREADY TAKE STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH FORMER BY DECREE. ONLY WAY HE COULD ASSURELATTER WAS BY FORCE HIS OWN AUTHORITY BACKED UP BY THAT OF MAN WHO HAD GREATEST INFLUENCE. MAN WAS HINH. HINH WILL CARRY BAO DAI'S ORDERS FOR INTEGRATION OF SECT FORCES INTO NATIONAL AR14Y AND BAO DAI GUARANTEES SECTS WILL OBEY HIM AND MESSAGE HINH CARRIES IF DIEM IS REMOVED FROM SCENE. 15. AT THIS STAGE OF INTERVTEW, BAO DAI BECAME SO EXCIETED THAT AT TIMES HE COULD BARELY TALK. HE SAID THAT NO MAN HAD EVER ENJOYED THE POWERS WHICH DIEM HAD HAD FROM VERY BEGINNING. BAO DAI HAD TRANSFERRED ALL HIS POWERS TO HIM. HE WAS FULLY BACKED BY BOTH FRANCE AND U.S. HE WAS GIVEN LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND HIS MILITARY FORCES WERE CLOTHED, FED AND EQUIPPED BY FOREIGNERS. HE WAS CONSTANTLY HELPED BY FOREIGNERS TO DO THINGS HE WAS INCAPABLE OF DOING HIMSELF. GENERAL COLLINGS AND ELY AND BAO DAI HAD ALL BEEN IN HIS SERVICE. EVEN CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE VIETNAM ARMY WAS REMOVED FROM SCENE BECAUSE DIEM DIDN'T 953        . E -3- 4746, APRIL 30, 8 PM, FROM PARIS (SECTION 2 OF 2) DIDNT LIKE HIM. NOW THINGS HAD GONE TOO FAR AND CONSIDERATION HAD TO BE TAKEN OF WHAT WAS BEST FOR VIETNAMESE PEOPLE AND NOT WHAT WAS BEST FOR DIEM AND HIS FAMILY. VIETNAM WAS SUPPOSEDLY AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY SHE MUST THEREFORE MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS. BAO DAI WAS CHIEF OF STATE, AND INTENDED TO CARRY OUT HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS SUCH. 16. WE ASKED WHAT BROTHER LUYEN WAS STILL DOING IN CANNES AND WHETHER HE WAS SERVING AS INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN BAO DAI AND DIEM. AT THIS POINT BAO DAI REALLY EXPLODED AND STATED THAT BROTHER LUYEN HAD COME TO CANNES NOT FOR ANY PATRIOTIC PURPOSE AS "DIEM UNDOUBTEDLY HAD TOLD AMERICANS IN SAIGON," BUT RATHER ON SECRET MISSION FROM DIEM TO ATTEMPT TO BUY BAO DAI. SOME DAYS AGO BEFORE ANY ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SUMMON DIEM TO FRANCE OR OTHERWISE BAO DAI SAID LUYEN ARRIVED UNINVITED IN CAINES, BAO DAI KEPT HIM WAITING AND WHEN HE FINALLY RECEIVED HEM, LUYEN OFFERED BAO DAI THE SUM OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION FRANCS IF HE WOULD AGREE NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHICH WOULD AFFECT STATUS OF DIEM OR PREVENT HIM FROM ESTABLISHING HIS AUTHORITY BY FORCE. BAO DAI COMMENTED WITH INDIGNATION THAT, OF COURSE HE HAD REFUSED AND "THROWN LUYEN OUT OF THE HOUSE" BUT HE WAS STILL "GROVELLING" AROUND. HE STATED THAT LUYEN HAD MADE VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF HIS CLOSE RELATIONS WITH "AMERICANS" IN SAIGON. 17. AT END OF INTERVIEW BAO DAI ASKED IF WE COULD GIVE HIM ANY FURTHER WORD ON WASHINGTON'S REACTION TO PLAN SUBMITTED WEEK AGO. VIE EXPLAINED ONCE MORE THAT GENERAL COLLINS WAS. LEAVING WASHINGTON THAT DAY FOR SAIGON WHICH WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF WASHINGTON'S RECOGNITION OF EMERGENCY NATURE OF SITUATION THERE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT NO DECISIONS WOULD NOW BE REACHED UNTIL GENERAL COLLINS HAD ARRIVED IN SAIGON AND COULD CONFER THERE WITH EMBASSY AND ELY. IN MEANWHILE VIE INFORMED BAO DAI THAT HIS OBSERVATIONS WOULD BE PASSED TO DEPT IN THEIR ENTIRETY. 18. BAO DAI SAID HE WOULD SEND DE BACK TO PARIS MONDAY IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH US AND TO RECEIVE ANY OBSERVATIONS WASH-INGTON CARED TO MAKE TO HIM. AT SAME TIME HE WOULD INSTRUCT DE TO KEEP US AU COURANTE. DILLON PAF32 NOTE MR. HOEY (PSA) INFORMED 630 RM 43055 CWOFED 954           SECRET THE PROBLEM- To assess the implications of recent developments in Saigon and to estimate the probable actions of interested parties in the current crisis. THE ESTIMATE IMPLICAT1ONS O, CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SA1GON 1. The success of Premier Diem in operations against the Binh Xuyen, and in his stand against Bao Dai, the French, and General Vy, has created a new and potentially revolutionary situation in Vietnam. While the situation in Vietnam is extremely fluid, Diem appeal's to hold the initiative in thc phase that . is about to begin. In this phase, the interested parties particularly the French and Bao Dai will have to adapt themselves to a radically new political situation dominated by Diem or by more extreme nationalist elc-mcnts. If they do not adapt and if there are any substantial efforts by Bono Dai or the French to frustrate Diems government, the chances of anti-French violence and the de-posal of Bao Dai would be greatly increased. 2. Diems relations with the Revolutionary Council which has been actively injecting itself into this situation have not yct been clarified. This council, designated by a selfappointed assembly, takes a more extreme position than Diem, particularly in regard to the withdrawal of French forces and the im-niediate deposal of Bao Dai. It is dominated by Cao Dai generals Trinh Minh The and Nguyen Thanh Phuong and by Hoa Hao Gcn-eral Ngo and includes a number of extreme nationalist politicians. -General Ely now charges that the Council is Communist infiltrated but so far has not produced evidence to substantiate this charge. We have no signincant evidence to indicate that any of the members of the Council are Communist. In a proclamation the Council announced a broad program couched in social revolutionary terms but including a denunciation of red colonialism in North Vietnam. Its ac-tivitics have been denounced by the Communist radio in Hanoi as have those of Premier Diem. % PROBABLE COURSES Or ACTION OF INTERESTED PARTIES 3. Premier Diem. The virtual expulsion of the Binh Xuyen from Saigon-Cholon has increased Diems prestige throughout Vietnam. The confidence of Diem and his supporters in their own strength, judgment, and popular appeal has been considerably enhanced. In this situation, Diem will almost certainly continue to resist any efforts to remove him from office. 4. Kis actions and those of his followers have taken on an-increasingly nationalistic, antiFrench tone over the past few days and Diem may now be convinced that a continuation of this anti-French policy is essential to the rallying of popular support. Nevertheless he has exercised a moderating influence on the anti-French and ajlti-Bao Dai position of the Revolutionary Council. However, if he believed the French were continuing their efforts to depose him, he would almost certainly permit intensified anti-French manifestations. Such a course would carry grave dangers of anti-French violence, particularly in Saigon. S E C R E-TE . mOU 1 .     SECRET 2 5. So far, Diem and his principal Vietnamcse National Army (VNA) leaders havc appeared % desirous of maintaining good relations with the French. Diems attitude toward Bao Dai has been less clear and there have been in. dications that he has been considering the suggestions of the Council that Bao Dai be deposed. He may be using ultranationalism to bring pressure against Bao Dai and the French. If Jie is thwarted in his objectives by thc French or by' Bao Dai, he will become more susceptible to pressures toward extreme action. 6. Diem has rallied additional support during the current military phase, and from this position of strength, Diem will almost certainly continue to gain adherents, including defections from among the Binh Xuyen and the sects. 7. The Vietnamese National Army. Aside from the French Army, only the VNA presently has the capability to enforce Bao Dais authority in Saigon or to back Dicm in tiefiance of Bao Dai. There are some VNA ofli-cers who dislike Diem and who are concerned by the developing rift between Diern and Bao Dai. On the other hand, there is considerable pro-Diem, nationalist sentiment in the army; Diem has gaincd additional support as a result of clearing the Binh Xuyen from Saigon; and most importantly, the VNA units in the Saigon area appear to be loyal to Diem. 8. If Dicm should move precipitously to depose Bao Dai, or if Bao Dai attempted to oust Diem, some elements of the army might remain loyal to Bao Dai and attcmpt to overthrow Diem. We believe such eHorts would be unsuccessful, however, even if General Hinh had entered the country to rally support for Bao Dai. 9. Bao Dai. As a result of Dicms stand against Bao Dai and because of the latters involvement in what many Vietnamese nationalists considcr. to be a French-inspired political maneuver, Bao -Dais prestige has been greatly reduced, whatever the outcome of the present crisis. Bao Dais authority can only be enforced at this juncture by the force of French arms and any such action would almost completcly discredit him in Vietnam. 10. There appears to be considerable sentiment for the deposal of Bao Dai, and if Diem . gives his consent such action may be taken at any time. For the present, Bao Dai apparently feels that the tide is running with Diem, and is attempting to preserve the institution of thc- monarchy by accepting the continuation of the Dicm government. U. The French Government. The French will find it difficult to accept Diems success which came despite then strong and well-publicized opposition. We believe that fear.of large-scale violence and of adverse domestic and world reactions will cause the French to refrain from overs action in Saigon to restrain the VNA or to remove Diem, unless the situation should threaten serious loss of French lives. However, the extent, to which the French permit the VNA freedom of action and the nature of their dealings with the . Binh Xuyen and Bao Dai can still have an influence on the outcome of the 'immediate situation. Furthermore, we believe that the French will continue pressures for Diems removal; some French elements in Vietnam are likely to continue their covert assistance to Diems enemies. If the French believe that Dicm will succeed in consolidating his position, they may decide that they have no choice except-to repair their position with Diem as best they can while making plans for accelerated withdrawal of their forces.1 12. The Binh Xuyen. The military potential of the Binh Xuyen will depend on the extent of support they receive, directly or indirectly, from the French and the Eoa Hao. It appears that the morale of the Binh Xuyen troops is low, a number have already defected, and that many of the troops may be susceptible to peace The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State, believes that the last sentence of this paragraph understates the difficulty the French would have in accommodating to a strong, antiFrench government in South Vietnam, and therefore believes the sentence should read If these eorts are unsuccessful and Dicm appeared to be consolidating his position, the French in the end may decide that they have r.o choice except to step up the withdrawal of their iorc-v from Vietnam. SECRET 85 7     By NWD Dale 2011 SECRET  3 offers from the government. We believe that a considerable number of the Binh Xuyen may attempt to resume their life of piracy and extortion. The.VNA should be able to reduce the Binh Xuyen to the level of a local nuisance. 13. The Sects. We believe that for the im-mediate future the Cao Dai military forces under Generals The and Phuong will continue actively to support Diem against the Binh X' cn and Bao Dai. The Moa Hao are un-likely to play an important role in the immediate situation, although the Ba Cut forces m? continue their terrorist operations. 14 The Viet Minh. The Viet Minh probably fear that Diems continuation in office would limit the prospects of a peaceful unification of Vietnam under terms favorable to the Com-munists. They will probably continue covert efforts in South Vietnam to keep the situa-tion agitated. The Communists almost certainly will not invade South Vietnam in the near future. GENERAL OUTLOOK 15. In present circumstances, we do not be-lieve that Dicm could be persuaded voluntarily to resign. If he were forced from office, many of Diems followers would probably undertake revolutionary opposition, including maquis resistance, to the successor regime. Some VNA elements in Saigon and in central.Vict-nam would probably join these elements in resisting the new government. 16. Assuming that the US continues to sup-port Diem, and that the French acquiesce, we believe the situation will stabilize in Saigon ; under Diems control. Diems talents as an i administrator are unlikely to improve. His success, achieved largely on his own initiative i and with his own resources, is likely to make ; him more independent and less amenable to policy guidance. Diems government will still be confronted with manifold internal prob- lems e.g., integration of the sects, resettle-' ment of refugees, land reform, extension of government authority in the provinces, and training of the army. Although Diem has improved his position, we believe that it will j still be extremely difficult, at best, for Diem or any Vietnamese government to build sufn-cient strength to meet the long-range challenge of the Communists.

HE REFERRED TO CHINA AND TO FACT THAT FRANCE WAS NOW IGNORING GOVT WHICH HAD IN HANDS FATE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLION OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HER RECOGNITION OF FACT THAT US VIEWS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

DIVISION OF COUNTRY HAD GIVEN SOUTH VIETNAM DISADVANTAGE IN COMPETING WITH NORTH BUT WHAT SOUTH LACKED IN AREA AND POPULATION WAS COUNTER-BALANCED BY HER ECONOMIC SUPERIORITY. ' FRANCE BELIEVED THAT SOUTH COULD WIN OVER NORTH IN ELECTIONS IF SHE COULD PRESENT MORE ATTRACTIVE REGIME TO PEOPLE. THIS COULD BE DONE ONLY WITH NATIONALIST, STABLE AND BROADLY BASED GOVT. TIME WAS OF ESSENCE FOR DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO ELECTIONS WHICH WOULD OPEN NEXT JULY AND ELECTIONS THEMSELVES IN JULY 1956. THERE WAS NO AMBIGUITY IN FRENCH POLICY BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM. PRESENCE OF FRANCE IN NORTH COULD NOT BE ERASED BY STROKE OF PEN. IT IS FRENCH DUTY TO PROTECT HER CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC PRESENCE THERE. SAINTENY MISSION IS DESIGNED FOR ONLY THAT PURPOSE. FRANCE HAD GIVEN UP THOUGHTS OF MIXED COMPANIES AS RESULT OUR OBJECTIONS AND HAD NOW SURRENDERED COAL MINES. SAINTENY MISSION WOULD BE MAINTAINED ON ITS PRESENT TERMS. IT WOULD BE NEITHER ENLARGED NOR CHANGED. LAFOREST CONTINUED TO SAY THAT FRANCE HAD LOYALLY SUPPORTED GOVT OF DIEM FROM BEGINNING. ANY ALLEGATION TO CONTRARY IS UNTRUE. FRENCH CONSTANTLY TRIED TO REENFORCE DIEM GOVT. FRANCE REACHED AGREEMENT WITH US LAST DECEMBER TO PERSUADE "OR COMPEL" DIEM TO ENLARGE GOVT.

Diem is only means US sees to save South Vietnam and counteract revolution. US sees no one else who can. Whatever US view has been in past, today US must support Diem wholeheartedly. US must not permit Dierf to become another Karensky. Regarding Bao Dai, Secretary said in his view he had irretrievably lost capacity to be anything but titular head of government if even that position could be saved for him. and that this was solution Secretary preferred until election (of Rational Assembly). Bao Dai should support Diem and not take away his power. Cao Dai and Hoa Hao could be used but no Binh Xuyen. Secretary expressed opinion that with support two governments Diem could sit on top of revolution. Dien is only force of moderation., FEC a certain stabilizing influence. US was giving funds to support Vietnamese Army and could not see anyone else to give funds to but Dicm for that purpose. Concluded by stating that support of Diem was only way he could see to deal with common problem pointing out that time was running against us and no successful results could be achieved unless two countries worked together. Meeting was then joined by British for whom Secretary resumed US position as summarized above adding that in US view present revolution is not yet dominated or influenced by Communists to any appreciable degree. He remarked that prior association with Communists was not in itself sufficient reason to believe that man was a Communist now, citing that Bao Dai himself could be considered a Communist on this reasoning. Support of Diem did not indicate US non-recognition of his weaknesses. US had not taken part in his original selection and had been and remained ready to slipport any other man who might be presented by orderly process of law. He remarked that just before outbreak of fighting US was prepared to consider alternatives but he was not sure now that it would have been practical. Secretary remarked he was told last March by Collins that we had already reached point of no return on Diem. COPY      There was no practical way of getting rid of him. Secretary wished to do everything to get Diem to enlarge government. It might be possible to change government at the time of forthcoming elections but question remains "who is better than Diem." If there is a better man US is ready to consider him but re-submits no one has been suggested. Although Collins had reached agreement with Ely in early April to change Diem he now believes we must . support himFaure replied that he thought it best that he speak himself. He wished to state that France is not in agreement with US views. In the past we have concealed this fact from each other but now it is time to speak frankly. Diem is not a good solution. Joint efforts to prove he is have resulted in failure. France is convinced that Diem is leading to catastrophe. Diem took advantage of Collins absence to effect a "coup de force" which won primary victory but which has not contributed to any lasting solution. His anti-French sentiments are extreme. France does not object to his being anti-French if he is capable but being anti-French is not a sufficient quality in itself. Faure will not continue with him for, one way or another, he will bring on a Viet Minh victory. He is surrounded by Vietnam elements and there is not time to lose. Diem is not only incapable but mad (fou). He ruined our chances for a possible solution just when it was in the offing. France can no longer take risks with him. He could yield to the revolutionary groups. Continuing with Diem would have three disastrous results; . (1) It would bring on a Viet Minh victory, (2) It would focus the hostility of everyone on French, and (3) It will begin on a France-US breach. Everyone believes that the US is backing Diem and encouraging him in his anti-French sentiments even if the French Government knews US is not. Faure continued that much of France-US difficulty grows out of fact that we have never admitted our true thoughts from beginning. Last September we might have had an agreed solution if we had expressed our doubts but we did not. Bao Dai is a "bad card" but by means of him something is possible but with Diem failure is certain. We might have been able to save situation on eve of coup de force if we had had three-sided agreement (US, France, Bao Dai) but again we failed. Bao Dai has faults but he can serve a useful purpose and should be used for that. He cannot be excluded as a possibility for bringing about a more productive solution but as long as Diem is there the view is obstructed and no situation is possible. To resume, Faure said, Diem is impossible and there is no chance for him to succeed or to improve the situation. Another man might not be able to improve the situation'either and, in fact, there is.no one specifically in mind but at least with . another man there is a chance.

US INFORMED "COUP DE FORCE" WAS ENGINEERED BY BINH XUYEN WHILE FRENCH SAY OTHERWISE. SECRETARY HIMSELF HAD HAD DOUBTS THAT DIEM COULD SURVIVE. IT WAS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER ARMY WAS LOYAL TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CONTROL THE NATIONAL POLICE. LOYALTY OF FRENCH GOVT ITSELF IN SUPPORT OF DIEM WAS NOT QUESTIONED BUT THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS RADIO FRANCAISE-ASIE. US DOES NOT AGREE WITH FRENCH OPINION OF DIEM.

IT IS ASSUMED THAT FRANCE WOULD NOT FLESH TO DO SO BY FORCE. DIEM IS STRONGER NOW THAN WHEN BAO DAI FIRST WITHDREW HIS POWERS. WORST ASPECT IS THAT PROBLEM INVOLVES DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN FRANCE AND US. VIETNAM IS NOT WORTH QUARREL WITH FRANCE. COMMON INTERESTS ARE TOO GREAT TO BE JEOPARDIZED BY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON VIETNAM. SECRETARY AGREED WITH FRENCH STATEMENT THAT IT MUST NOT AFFECT FRANCO-US RELATIONS IN OTHER AREAS. IF IT WOULD SOLVE PROBLEM, US WOULD WITHDRAW AND DROP ITS SUPPORT OF VIETNAM. FRANCO-US DIFFERENCES MUST BE RESOLVED NOW FOR SECRETARY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT US CONGRESS WOULD CONTINUE WITH ITS PRESENT AID PROGRAM OTHERWISE. SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF 4 TO 5 HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARE INVOLVED. CHOICE OPEN TO US IS TO HAVE DIEM SUPPORTED OR TO WITHDRAW.

French position determined by two factors (1) Elys responsibility for safety FEC and for French lives and property; and as signatory of Geneva Accords; (2) French desire retain cultural and economic presence and to retain Vietnam as part French Union. B. Friction between French and Vietnamese'has reached serious proportions. It springs from two major sources; (1) Ely, to meet his responsibility for the safety of French lives and property, has established a French controlled security zone which includes large portion residential and business zone of Saigon proper. He has introduced new French battalions to protect this zone. Presence these forces,-reported refusals to permit VNA units to move through French Zone, and sanctuary provided to three Binh Xuyen posts located within security zone are constant irritants to Vietnamese nationalists. (2) Anti-Diem propaganda such as broadcast by Radio France-Asia and allegations of French support of sects, particularly Binh Xuyen, which widely credited by Vietnamese, have added oil to fire. C. Ely and French authorities here have finally concluded Diem must go. Increasing French bitterness toward Diem and their sensitivity to "anticolonialist" propaganda has to some extent been extended to US whom they blame for not joining with them in pressing Diem to seek cease-fire. French likewise tend blame US for recent bloodshed because we did not agree with them in finding political solution to governmental crisis some three weeks ago.  D. Strong anti-French aspect of Revolutionary Committee has great appeal to large segments of population which beneath surface has long nourished hatred and contempt 'for French. COPY .    By NWD Date 201 1 L c c c  E r E  I k r r L E E. Quite regardless of future developments, episodes of last week, featured by increasing strain in French-Vietnamese relations, cannot help but severely jeopardise France's long range interests in Vietnam. Of late one hears less and less mention of maintenance cultural and economic interests and influence and more and more of threats that France will drop responsibilities and withdraw FEC. ' We believe this to be passing phase, however. F. Reference the activities of Revolutionary Committee and States General local French.have same fears that we do. French are convinced that Revolutionary Committee is penetrated by VietMinh agents, but have so far been v tble to give us any conclusive proof They are also skeptical about the States General being able to modify radical resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee. ,  G I think it is fair to say that French are convinced that Diem desires overthrow Bao Dai and will continue efforts to do so irrespective of current activities of Revolutionary Committee. H. As indicated in recent telegrams, General Ely and the Commissariat General in Saigon have become so emotional in their bitter opposition to Diem and his entourage, that I fear they have lost some of their objectivity as to popular reaction to Diem's recent moves, his hold on the Army, and his ability to deal with the Binh Xuyen. They are quite convinced that serious warfare will be initiated by the Binh Xuyen, and that anti-French sentiment fomented by Diem and perhaps Viet Minh may still cause serious outbreaks in foreign sections of Saigon. KIDDER E Lli UiMME 3 SC8       t vDj DEPARTMENT OF STATE FROM Saigon TO Secretary of State NO 5O?4, May 5, 9 p.m. (SECTION FOUR OF FOUR) NIACT SENT DEPARTMENT 5074, REPEATED INFORMATION NIACT PARIS 1305 8. Conclusions;  A. It would appear to me that the essential steps in reconstitution of joint American-French approach to situation in Vietnam should be as follows (1) Diem government should be fully supported in bringing to a final and quick solution its conflict with the Binh Xuyen. (A) This will require on part of French, not only in Paris but more importantly in Saigon, that genuine acsistance rather than passive selfobstruction be offered to Vietnamese Government and armed forces. (B) Specifically, General Ely should be directed take active steps, to persuade Binh Xuyen to withdraw their forces from three police posts remaining within French security zone in Saigon, or if Binh Xuyen refuse, then to permit Vietnam armed forces to reduce these posts with minimum of casualties. (C) All echelons of French bureaucracy, including armed forces, should be instructed to desist from agitating against Diem government. (D) Official pressure, both in Paris and Saigon, should be brought upon Radio France-Asia, a semi-governmental institution, to cease its attacks on Diem government. (E) Such steps as may be possible should be taken to persuade French pressmen to cease their attacks, particularly in Saigon. (F) French garrison in Saigon-Cholon should be reduced without delay(G) There should be a public announcement by appropriate French authorities of their full support of Diem government in present conflict with Binh.Xuyen. possible to assist organization and training of essential logistical services of Vietnamese prmed forces so as to make them as independent as possible of FEC. This is under way in accordance with my instructions to MAAG.      (2) As soon as current crisis is over, decisive effort must be made to persuade or otherwise force Diem to reorganize his government and to establish a cabinet competent to implement broad programs of reform covered by the Collins-Ely seven-point program, plus a program for integration of sects into normal life of Vietnam. (3) If, after reasonable further period of trial, Diem is unable to constitute a government capable of implementing these programs, US should join with France and Bao Dai in assisting liberal Vietnamese nationalists to establish a competent government. B. I recognize that General Ely may irrevocably be opposed to supporting any Dicm government. If this should prove to be true, I would suggest we urge Faure government to replace him, preferably with man of caliber of D> inat, or perhaps Georges-Niact. At same time, it would probably be necessary to replace General Jacquat (who has incurred violent animosity of Vietnamese during Binh Xuyen affairs) with man like General Cogny. C. Reference step (3) above, I recognize also that it may be politically difficult to withdraw US support from Diem even if trial proves is capable of establishing an effective government. I still feel that even if Dien manages suppress Binh Xuyen, this will not change his own basic incapacity to manage the affairs of government. Hrs present successes may even make it harder for us to persuade Diem to take competent men into government, to decentralize authority to his ministers, and to establish sound procedures for the implementation of reform programs. I am still convinced Diem does not have knack of handling men nor the executive capacity truly to unify the country and establish an effective government. If this should become evident, we should either withdraw from Vietnam because our moneywill be wasted, or we should take such steps as can legitimately be taken to secure an effective new PremierD. Throughout all this I feel we must keep our eyes clearly on our main objective in Vietnam, i.e., to assist in saving this country from Communism. Ho matter who heads the government here, free Vietnam will not be saved unless sound political, economic and military programs are promptly and effectively put into action. This will require wholehearted agreement and coordination between Vietnamese, Americans and French. Difficult aS this may be to achieve, it is possible, in my judgment. If this tripartite approach is not secure, we should withdraw from Vietnam. KIDDER COPY     MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Indochina (Vietnam). L . 1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff submit herewith their views re ;rding the military aspects of the problem presented in Vy- the attached excerpt from a telegram from Hr. Dulles to the . Department of State. 2. The situation as depicted in the telegram from MrDulles appears to present the United States with a choice  between , e a. Continuing to support the" Dicm Government in Vietnam -- which would result in the withdrawal of French forces from that country; or b. Withdrawing United States Support from Vietnam --r . allewin" the French to deal with the situation as they deem fit. 3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the question as to Whether thc United States should or should not continue to support thc Dicm Government, or any other particular Vietnamese regime, is one for resolution at the governmental E level. Their ccmments relatiVe to the alternatiVes set forth above are, therefore, limited to their military implications. 1 1 E L 4. It is considered doubtful that the Vietnam National Army (VNA), in its present state of development and unassisted by other forces, can continue to maintain internal security under the conditions of near-civil war now prevailing in Vietnam. There is even less likelihood that thc VNA could offer more than a token resistance to external aggression. Further, it is open to question whether thc VNA world be loyal to thc Dicm Government under all circumstances. The presence and cooperation of an outside milltar;, force is therefore essential at-this time if Vietnamese security and intogrlty are to be aysured. Thc United States is debarred by the- proVislons of the Genova Agreement from providing Such forces, and could therefore give ho aSSuranccn regarding the protection of lives and property of French or any other foreign nationals. While thc withdrawal Declassified per Executive Ordcr 13526    of the French Expeditionary Corps in ultimately to be desired, -it is considered that a precipitate withdrawal now would be ' likely to result in an Increasingly unstable and precarious situation. This situation would undoubtedly be exploited to Communist adVantage, with the probable eventuality that South Vietnam would be lost to communism. 5. In the face of the strong anti-French sentiment which has developed in Vietnam, there now seems little prospect that France alone can provide either the leadership or the resources required to establish a stable Vietnamese government. Without United States moral and materiel support it cannot be expected that the VNA would develop into a cohesive military force or maintain even its present limited effectiveness. Without effective indigenous forces and without a Vietnam government which can command the loyalty and support of its people, the French Expeditionary Corps (FEC), judged by past performances, would be incapable of preserVing the security and integrity of Vietnam. It can therefore be expected that, following the pattern which led to the loss in the North, South Vietnam would, in due course, fall to the Communists. 6. For the foregoing reasons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that neither of the alternatives suggested represent acceptable solutions to the problem of Vietnam at this time. They feel it to be in thc best interest of France as well ao of the United States that CVery reasonable effort be exerted to preserve South Vietnam from communism. It in their opinion that thc present situation, inuolving armed resistance against the established governmental authority and the dangers inherent in the role assumed by the Revolutionary Committee, requires thc utmost in cooperation and energetic action by the Vietnamese, United States, and French Governments toward the restoration of internal order and governmental control in Vietnam. It is considered that this should constitute thc immediate joint objective. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that Hr. Dulles be advised that from the military point of View a. The government of Prirtte Minister Pgo Dinh Diem shows the" greatest promise of achieving the internal stability essential for the future security of Vietnam. b. The United States could not guarantee the security of the French nationals should the French Expeditionary Corps be withdrawn. ;  E      t p.

Enclosure i         EXCERPT FROM TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY DULLES"We met alone With the French,- being joined after a time by the British for discussion of Indochina. Faure proposed that in Vieu of the sharp differences of opinion which existed between our two QoVernments With reference to policy in Vietnam ' and in Vieu of his Government's total inability to support Diem, who had now become Violently anti-French, he proposed that the French should Withdraw their, forces from Vietnam. He raised the question as to whether in this event we Would be ' able to give any assurances vySrding protection of lives F 0 ' '. and property of remaining nationals. 1 replied that this was too serious a matter to . settle without deliberation, and that T agreed that Vietnam was not worth a quarrel betueen France and the United States. If wo could not agree, then one or the other should Withdraw from the scene, as t-ze could not afford to oppose each other in this area and adopt rival and competitive policies. I said that the United States Would be Willing to Withdraw, and indeed I could not have any good hope that Congress would appropriate the necessary funds for us to support the situation if we withdrew support from Diem and sought an alternatiVe which Faure himself said he could not nou define. My guess is that the French are not bluffing and that his proposal may be the agreed solution.11  74       .  p MEMORANDUM ' . SUBJECT Possible French Withdrawal from Vietnam 1M. Faures proposal to Mr. Dulles that the French Withdraw  their forces from Vietnam may, if properly played, permit a real reversal of the trend toward Communism in Southeast Asia. If the U. S. can and will make a deal wiOn Dicm, in which hc E pledges to protect French civilians remainingafter French troops leave, in return for our assurances of increased aid and the rapid . and effective training of his army, we should be happy to see the p French leave. 11 A move of this sort would clearly disengage us from the taint  of Colonialism derived from our support of the French and Bao Dai which has plagued us throughout .Asia. It would put us clearly in L our traditional role of supporting the "independence and legitimate national aspirations" of peoples. The repercussions of this throughout Asia and the Moslem world will be great and beneficial. A clear stand against French colonialism may greatly free our hands at some later date with regard to French North Africa where an explosion like Indo China seems inevitable. French withdrawal will also effectively stop the potential E double-dealing ue have suspected of the Saintenay mission in Viet Minh, where it appears the French have been insuring against the loss of Free Vietnam to the Viet Minh by compromising with the Communists so  as to retain commercial and other advantages after a takeover. At one time it was rumored the French might even accept a Communist Indo China in the French Union. A tacit assumption by the U. S. of the support of Free Viet Nara might, of course, eventually involve us in a substantial commitment. However, this is by no means certain, and there is a real likelihood training, technical assistance and moderate aid will be all that is required. We should not forget that we ere already committed under SEATO to defend Viet Nam against overt attack. The new situation would permit, in psychological terms, the all-out use of "Militant Liberty to help build Free Viet Nam resolve. As a final point to remember, the French declared at Gcneva that they woul'd withdraw their forces at any tine if requested by the Free Viet Ham Government..

It was recotmcnded that thc- Military Advisers Group approve the conclusions of this paper and make arrangement accordingly. 3- The French Delegation did not accept the recommendation made in this report. It questioned the usefulness at the mt tine of the creation of a permanent secretariat and held the view that coordination of studies can be satisfactorily carried out by the Staff Planners at their meetings. If it lgreed in the future that closer coordination was required it could best be achieved through the military liaison group without setting up a new body however small. It also suggested that ns a rulc ad hoc com tittces meet in a few places, centrally located in the Treaty Area.

SECRET PROBABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTH VIETNAM TO JULY 1955 (Supersedes Portions of NIE 63-7-54 on North Vietnam) THE PROBLEM To analyze the present strengths and weaknesses of North Vietnam and to estimate probable future developments and trends to July 1956. CONCLUSIONS 1. The immediate concern of the Demo-cratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) is to consolidate its control in the area north of the 17th Parallel and to gain control of South Vietnam. (Para. 14) 2. We believe that the DRV will experi-ence no great difficulty in maintaining effective control of North Vietnam during the period Of this estimate and will prob-ably retain a considerable measure of prestige and general acceptance. How-ever, passive resistance and discontent resulting from harsh control measures and poor economic conditions may increase toward the end of the period. If the situation in the South does not de-teriorate, the nationalist appeal of Ho Chi Minh emd the DRV wit probably be reduced throughout Vietnam. (Para. 23) 3. The DRV is confronted by serious eco-nomic problems Of which the current rice shortage is the most critical. Its present export potential falls far short of providing sufficient funds to pay for neces- sry. imports. However, the Sino-SoViet Bloc'will almost certainly provide sufn-cient economic and technical assistance to meet minimum requirements for stability and COntrol. With such assistance the DRV will probably make gradual progress in gaming control of the economy and in rehabilitating transporta-tion, irrigation, and industrial facilities. (Paras. 2430) 4. Since the Geneva Conference, the strength of the DRV regular army has been increased substantially by drawing on regional forces to form new units and by the receipt of new and heavier mili-tary equipment from Communist China. -DRV forces are capable of defeating all military forces, including the French, I now located in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. (Paras. 31-35) 5. The present DRV tactic with respect to South Vietnam is to pose as the champion of Vietnamese independence and unification, and as the defender of i SEC REyfx vU J  I      T r f  r r E SECRET  2 L r i . the provisions of the Geneva Agreement? The DRV probably still believes that it ' could emerge from free nationwide elcc- tions with control of all Vietnam. It will attempt to appear reasonable in any negotiations concerning procedures for elections. While the Communists almost certainly would not agree to complex and elaborate safeguards and guarantees, they probably would agree to some form of neutral" (but nOt UN) supervision. They would probably estimate that such election controls would work to their advantage in the South and, as manipulated, would not adversely affect their position in the North. (Paras. 44-45) 6. In the meantime, the DRV will continue its efforts, through sub Version, intimidation, and propaganda, to weaken the Diem government, and to bring to power in the South men prepared to ac-ccpt a coalition with the DRV. (Para. 46) 1. The Communists in their propaganda have revealed sensitivity to the implication of thc Manila Paet which incorporated Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lacs in its area of protectiOn. We believe that concern for Western, and particularly US reactions, together with general considera-; tions arising from over-all Bloc policy, 1 will prevent the DRV from openly in-' vading the South during the period of' this estimate. Similarly, the resumption of widespread guerrilla activities appears unlikely prior to the election deadline, unless the DRV should come to the con-cIusion that.South Vietnam can be won. -------- i '  v " 1 For an estimate of probable developments in South Vietnam, see NIE 63.1-3-55, Probable Developments in South Vietnam Through July 1955, to be published in August T955. only by force. Such a conclusion would become more likely should the Diem government persist in refusing to enter the.-election discussions, should election dis- 1 cussions not proceed favorably .for the . DRV, Or should the Diem government j succeed, with US assistance, in consolidating its strength to the point of bc-coming a nationalist alternative to the  Ho regime. Moreover, if during the 1 period cf this estimate little progress is ; made towards Relaxing tensions, Peiping  and Moscow might permit the DRV; greater freedom of action. Should the DRV decide to use force short 01 open ; invasion, it would probably attempt to  undermine the Saigon government by initiating a campaign of sabotage and terror, seeking fo formation of a new gov-emment more amenable to demands for a national coalition. Thesa tactics are likely to include the activation of DRV guerrilla units now in South Vietnam and their reinforcement by the infiltration in small units of regulars from the North. (Para. 47) . 3. The DRV will probably refrain from launching an attack with its own forces to seize Laos during the period of this estimate.2 It will probably continue efforts to convince the Royal Laotian government of the propriety of the DRV attitude toward Laos, while covertly strengthening the rebel Pathet Lac moye-ment. The DRV would probably infiltrate anned units into Laos to assist the Pathet Lao if Royal government .military action should seriously threaten the For an estimate of probable developments in Laos, see NIE 3.3-55, "Probable Developments in Laos Through July !S56. to be published in July 1955.

The Communists now have few assets in Cambodia and will probably be unable to develop a significant-internal threat in that country until their position is greatly strengthened in Laos or South Vietnam.3 In the meantime, the DRV will probo dy continue its efforts to promote DiSCUSSlON L C L r I. INTRODUCTION 11. Under the terms of the Gencva Accords, and with the final withdrawal of French forccs from the Haiphong area on 18 May 1955, a Communist regime known as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) has assumed full responsibility for the administration of the territory of Vietnam north of the l7th Parallel, pending a political settlement and thc unification of the country. 12. The DRV, known also as the Viet Minh, ,vas established at thc end of the Sccond World War when a coalition of Vietnamese of all political leanrags drew together under the leadership of the veteran Communist, Ho Chi Minh, and proclaimed Vietnamese independence. The DRV openly and frequently professed its solidarity with the Sino-Soviet Bloc aftcr 1949. Since then any loss by the DRV of its Vietnamese support has been offset by a considerable increase in organizational and material strength and by the prestige of victories over French forces. 13. Although the recent assumption of responsibility over 13 million people and several large cities has confronted the DEV with major problems, thesa problems are not en-tircly new or unrelated to previous DRV experience. During its years of resistance, which was conducted until 1950 with little or- . , For an estimate of probable developments in Cambodia, see NIE C3.2-55, "Probable Dcvelop-ments in Cambodia Through July 1956, to be published in August 1955. friendly relations and to secure Cambodian neutrality. (Para. 50) 10. We believe the DRV will be willing to continue political and economic contacts with the French. However, it 'almost certainly will be unwilling to make any agreement which in fact would permit the French to retain an economic and cultural position in North Vietnam. (Paras. 51-56) . no external assistance and under conditions of severe physical hardship and austerity, the DRV leadership was able to weed out the weak and timid, build an effective army, train a substantial number of experienced cadres and local aelministators, and obtain considerable experience in the techniques of political control. "Thus, when the DRV assumed'control of all North Vietnam in 1954, it possessed considerable advantages over the Diem government in terms of military strength and experience, organization and sense of unity and purpose. 14. While the immediate concern of the DRV is to consolidate its control in the North and to gain control of South Vietnam, its longer run objectives almost certainly are to build a strong Communist state in all Vietnam and to assist in the extension of Communist control throughout Southeast Asia. II. INTERNAL SITUATION AND TRENDS Siabiiiiy and Eneciiveness o? the Regime 15. The DRV is organized on the normal pattern of all Communist "peoples democracies. Although the government of the DEV ostensibly represents all elements in a united front grouping (the Lien Viet), actual power resides in the Communist party (the Lao Dong or Workers Party). Out of a total population in North Vietnam of some 13 million, the Lien Viet is estimated to have approximately S million members, including the Lao Dong, which SECRET      Submitted by the o o nt'a, The oTZowiny intelligence organizations participated in the preparation of this estimate Thc Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence organizations of the Departments oj State, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and The Joint Staff.

TOT SECRET l r r L r L r r L 1 E 1  CONSEQUENCES OF POSSIBLE US COURSES OF ACTION 4WITH RESPECT TO VIETNAM1 .   . THE PROBLEM To estimate the deterrent effect on the Viet Minh of certain US courses of ac-tiOn; to assess the consequences of a US failure to counter overt Viet Minh aggression2 and to assess the political repercussions of US arme'd interVention against Viet Minh aggression. THE ESTIMATE 1. INTRODUCTORY NOTE ably estimate that (a) Viet Minh forces alone 1. We continue to regard as valid the estimate made in NIE 63.1-55, namely that during the period of the estimate (to July 1953) "concern for Western and particularly US reactions, together with general considerations arising . from over-all Bloc policy, will prevent the DRV from openly invading the South. We also believc that the present Communist policy of reducing international tension makes unlikely the resort to overt aggression. II. DETERRENT EFFECTS ON THE VIET MINH OF THE US UNDERTAKING SUFHCIENT MIL1-TARY, POLIT1CAL, AND ECONOMIC STEPS TO CLEARLY CONVINCE THE COMMU-NiSTS THAT OVERT AGGRESS1ON BY THE VIET MINH AGAINST SOUTH ViETNAM Will BE MET BY SWIFT AND DETERM1NED US ARMED INTERVENT1ON 2. This assumed US course of action would render even less likely than at present any overt aggression by the Viet Minh against South Vietnam. The Communists would prob- The possible US courses of action considered herein were furnished the intelligence Communi-ty for the purposes of this estimate. "Aggression in this paper'is defined as a Viet Minh attack by overt armed forces across the armistice line, of such a character that it can clearly be labeled as aggression and is generally regarded as such by free world opinion. would not be able to capture South Vietnam in the face of swift and determined US armed intervention; (b) Chinese Communist assist-"ancc would have to be on such a scale as to seriously risk spreading the war beyond Vietnam; and (c) acquisition of South Vietnam would not be worth such a risk. Thesc con-siderations would lead the Communists to refrain from overt aggression even if they could see no prospect of winning South Vietnam by other means and believed they enjoyed a marked superiority in forces locally available. 3. The assumed US course of action would not in itself preclude either a Communist decision to initiate large-scale guerrilla action in South Vietnam or the clandestine support of such actions by the Viet Minh. 4. The deterrent effect on the Communists of the assumed course of action would be in-increased if the US made it clear that nuclear weapons would be used. If the US made it clear that nuclear weapons would not be used the deterrent eHect would be reduced. How-ever, the Communists would probably estimate that the US would not maintain such a position if faced with a deteriorating military situation. In the absence cf any clear indica-tion, the Communists would almost certainly base their plans cn thc possibility that nuclear weapons would be used.        2 III. CONSEQUENCES O.= A US FAILURE TO INTERVENE AGAINST AN OPEN VI FT MINH ATTACK AFTER HAVING TAKEN THE PREPARATORY STEPS ASSUMED IN II ABOVE 5. The Communists would vigorously exploit the opportunities in Asia created by the failure of the US to intervene in Vietnam. Although Communist China and the Viet Minh would probably not launch early ovcrt aggression against other countries, Chinese Communist diplomacy would probably become openly threatening, possibly supplemented by intimidatory troop movements near the Chincse Communist border with Burma and Inos or within Communist-held Vietnam. Communist policy would also be furthered by greatly increased support from overseas Chinese communities. 6. The Chinese Communists would probably apply strong pressure against those countries whose determination to resist Communist inroads had been most weakened. They would demand an accommodation to thc Bloc going beyond the benevolent neutralism that is thc current goal of Communist strategy in much of the area. Where more forceful action appeared necessary, Pciping would almost certainly encourage local Communist groups to resume and enlarge guerrilla operations and would support those operations more directly than in the recent- past. In some cases units of Chinese Communist troops, possibly of minority origin, might be assigned to reinforce local guerrilla units. Communist operations against the offshore islands might bc stepped up, but a full-scale attack against Taiwan would probably not be initiated. " 7. The consequences of a US failure to intervene to save South Vietnam would be most serious in Asia. US prestige and influence would be drastically lowered, and the Manila Pact as an effective instrument against Communist aggression would almost certainly bc destroyed. Even immediate and forceful subsequent US action elsewhere in Southeast Asia might not persuade any state in the area that further Communist pressure could bc resisted. These countries would be reluctant to accept US offers of assistance from fear that closer alignment with the US would merely invite the Communists to further acts of aggression and that in such an event US assistance would not be forthcoming. They would bccome in-cveasingly inclined to attempt to maintain their independence through negotiated understandings with Peiping. 8. Both Laos and Cambodia would probably initially proclaim a neutralist position but would shortly enter into cultural and economic agreements with Communist China as the f.rst steps'toward political accormnoda-tion. Thai apprehensions for their own security would greatly increase. Successive government changes might bring to power a leadership amenable to an accommodation with Communist China. Burma would probably not consider such Communist action as a direct threat and would seek to remain neutral. Should the Thai government reach an -accommodation with the Communists, Burma would become concerned and voufd probably seek a closer alignment with India. The British would be gravely concerned over the security of Malaya and would almost certainly press for the commitment of US forces to the defense of Malaya. Although the Philippines, South Korea, and Nationalist China would remain allied with the US, they would have grave doubts concerning the future. They would almost certainly press the US for a more concrete demonstration of its determination to defend them. In Japan, neutralist sentiment would increase. Indonesia would attempt to maintain a neutral orientation but would be drawn toward an accommodation with the Communist Bloc as Communist influence spread through mainland Southeast Asia. 9. The reactions of the Western European allies of the US would be mixed. On the one hand, they would be concerned about the implications of US withdrawal in the face of an open Communist attack, and there would probably be an increase in defeatist and neutralist sentiment. On the other hand, we bc-lieve that these concerns would tend to be offset by their relief that a crisis in the Far East had not led to a renewal of armed con-  sss      3  1 L r f f c . flict which might embroil them in general war. In any event, the Europeans would not neces-. sarily conclude that the US would fail to resist Communist aggression in Western Europe. Middle East defense arrangements might become more difficult because of a loss of con-fldence in US commitments. IV. CONSEQUENCES OF A FAliURE Or THE US TO INTERVENE AGAINST AN OPEN VIET MINH ATTACK WITHOUT HAV1NG PREViOUSLY MADE INTENTIONS CLEARER THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT 10. The local reactions to the US failure to intervene under these conditions would be . virtually the same in Southeast Asia as they would be under the conditions discussed in . Section HI above. It is widely believed in Southeast Asia that the US is already committed through the Manila Pact to thc defense ' of South Vietnam and that it has strong moral ' obligations to the Diem government. However, if the US had made its intentions no clearer than at present, the Communists would be lcss inclined to belicvc that the US failure to intervene indicated that the US would not resist Communist aggression elsc-where. The Communists might therefore proceed more cautiously in their efforts to exploit the situation created by the fall of South Vietnam. Outside Southeast Asia, the damage to US prestige and the dccline in the will to resist Communist pressure would be less than under the conditions discussed in Section III above. V. CONSEQUENCES OF US ARMED INTERVENTION IF THE US (a) STATED ITS O3JEC-TiVE WAS LIM1TED TO RESTORiNG THE STATUS-QUO AT THE 17th PARALLEL, O.R (b) STATED ITS OBJECTIVE WAS TO DESTROY THE ViET MINH REGIME AND EX. TEND NON-COMMUN1ST CONTROL TO ALL VIETNAM 11. Asian and European approval of US armed intervention against clearly recognizable Communist aggression would be tempered in varying degrees by the fear that thc fighting could not be limited to Vietnam. Our NATO allies and Japan would exert pressure on the US to limit its objective to restoring the status-quo and to keep its military actions clearly consonant with t hat objective. They would I be deeply concerned if the US declared its ob- jective to be the destruction of the Viet Minh' regime, or carried the fighting beyond Vietnam. India and other neutrals would exert every effort to bring the fighting to an end. 12. The other nations of mainland Southeast Asia would be encouraged in their efforts to resist Communist pressure by US intervention. They too, however, would fear that the fighting could not be limited to Vietnam and that they would become embroiled in general war in the Far East. Only Nationalist China, the ROK, and possibly Thailand and the Philippines, would give unqualified support to a US declaration that its objective was to destroy thc Viet Minh regime and extend non-Comrnunist control to all Vietnam. 13. The Communist reactions to US intervention would probably depend on the course of US military actions rather than on any statements of US objectives.

The Department of State has informed this office that pressure is .increasing, particularly from the Asian members o'f SEATO, for a permanent SEATO Council and Military Staff, organization. At a recent meeting of the Military Staff Planners held at Pearl Harbor, TH (1-15 November), it was the conclusion of the U.S. representatives that the position of the U.S. relative to avoiding a commitment to the concept of a permanent SEATO military staff organization was fast becoming untenable. CINCPAC reported this in his message to CNO, 23O211Z November, when he stated "It has been U.S. policy to oppose formation of a permanent SEATO staff organization. In this connection, formation of some sort of permanent SEATO staff organization may be inevitable and U.S. eventually may find it necessary to yield on this point or find itself in no position to refute paper tiger charges. It may be more realistic to take the initiative in this matter so as to be in a better position to influence the size and shape of the end product." The attitude of the Asian countries signatory to the Treaty indicates that they are losing faith in SEATO as a means for deterring Communist expansion in Southeast Asia. In this connection, the Asian States consider that the U.S. is not leading sufficient support to SEATO. Further, the recent Russian visits to Southeast Asia and continuing Chinese Communist activities in the area could result in the Asian members of the Treaty leaning more to a neutralist position. The Department of State is currently re-examining the U.S. position as pertains to a permanent staff organization for the SEATO Council and has indicated that, due to the need for adding "substance" to SEATO, consideration is being given to the desirability of a U.S. proposal at the 6 March Council meeting, for the establishment of a permanent SEATO Council staff. SecDef Cont. No. S-578      SECRET It is requested that the Department of the Navy obtain CIIICPACs detailed views on this matter. Upon receipt of CINCPAC's views they will be presented to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for consideration in conjunction with other policy factors as a basis for the development of a Department of Defense position regarding a permanent military staff organization.

The recommendations of the Team will lead to substantial improvements in budgeting, including savings of millions of dollars during the calendar year 1956. Steps have already been initiated to realize these savings. The Team also studied the logistic situation in Free Viet-Nam and has reported deficiencies which are of greatest concern to me. Only by prompt action at highest departmental levels will it be possible to correct the problems. Since the recent heavy phasedown ip French forces, or adequate logistic capability in Free Viet-Nam no longer exists. The Team reported that "...the capability of supply of forces in the field in the event hostilities should be resumed in mid-1956 would be virtually non-existent." From the standpoint of preservation of U.S., assets, the situation is also most unsatisfactory. Adequate control of MOAP spares and supplies has, in large part, been lost. we have concluded that not less than $100,000,000 worth of MOAP materiel can be saved if prompt corrective act,ion can be taken. Such action includes the availability in Viet-Nam in the immediate future of 150 to 200 Americans skilled in supply management and logistics. A further essential factor in achieving effective supply control is the implementation of the Collins-Ely Minute of Understanding of 1 December 1954. This Agreement provides for the return by the French of U.S. equipment no longer required for the purposes for which originally made available. The Agreement further states that decisions on what is to be returned should be made jointly by French and U.S. representatives. Nevertheless, the French are making these decisions unilaterally; it appears that they are carefully sorting out the useful, serviceable items for their own use, and returning the excess and salvage, we know of no valid reason why U.S. personnel should not be allowed to enter French military storage areas to participate in these determinations. 10i+6 SecDef Cont.

Tho Communists have an estimated 10,000 guerrillas in South Vietnam, scattered in small groups in rur<nl areas but presumably still responsivo.to control from Hanoi0 The principal infested areas are the plateau region of northern South Vietnam the southern peninsula (Camau), and the canal-woven area southwest of Saigon where the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) is currently engaged in operations against the Hoa Haoo Communist agents reportedly have boon .

The latters increasingly effective defensive tactics have made recent VNA operations relatively costly. I . In addition to the continuing presence of these guerrilla elements, the Communists have presumably tried to penetrate all branches of the government. The most frequent reports suggest heavy penetration of the Inf rmation Ministry. The absence of reliable information does not disprove some probable penetration of police and military services, particularly at lower levels. The Communists have a surviving capability to disrupt governmental operations, and perhaps to immobilize the regime, through a coorc nated campaign of terror and assassination a capability they have thus far chosen not to exercise. T Political Problems The March 4 election will, in all probability, produce a national assembly that will overwhelmingly support Diem and approve the constitution that a pro-Diem commission has prepared. The constitution will establish a presidential system with separation of powers. Balloting will not indicate accurately the extent of anti-Diem sentiment, for a number of nationalist leaders, particularly refugees from the north, appear disinclined to risk censure or repression by contesting the election as opposition ' candidates. It will be essential, in the immediate future, that Diem have effective control over the administration and the national assembly. He has the support of the National Revolutionary Movement (NRM), which has become, in effect his political party. There is some question, nevertheless, whether at present Diem is unnecessarily antagonizing elements which might add strength to the future government. He remains almost pathologically sensitive to criticism and potential opposition, with the result that the regime is becoming increasingly autocratic despite his democratic principles. In view of Diem's skill in dealing with dissident elements over the past year, it will perhaps be wise to give him the benefit of the doubt during the pre-election period. Economic Conditions There has been little recent change in the economic picture in South Vietnam. Rice prices, which rose precipitously during the summer and fall due largely to poor distribution, have now returned to normal. A major program for resettlement in southwest Vietnam of up to 100,000 of the refugees from the north is now developing, with US and other foreign support. If successful, it would simultaneously reduce the problems of 1) the refugees, 2) increased agricultural production, and 3) internal security in rural areas. SECRET-I'WF NOFORN -;"f OLI X.I .

S, security is posed by the 1 lstile policies and power, including growing nuclear power, of the Soviet-Communist bloc, With its Communist ideology and . international apparatus.  h. The basic problem confronting the United States is how, without uncle ruining fundamental U. S. values and in- stitutions or seriously Weakening the U. S. economy, tO meet and ultimately to reduce to acceptable propOrtions this threat to U. S. security. I 5. The United States and .its allies have no foreseeable prospect of stopping the growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities and of reducing Soviet armed strengththe core- of Communist poveror of significantly reducing other basic Communist military strength, except by mutually acceptable agreements With the SOViets or by large-scale military action. The initiation by the United States of such military action for this purpose is not an acceptable course either to the United States or its major allies. 6. Hence, U. S, policies must be designed (1) to affect the conduct and policies of the Communist regimes, especially those of the USSR, in Ways that further U, S. security interests (including safeguarded disarmament); and (2) to fOster tendencies that lead them to abandon expansionist policies. In pursuing this general strategy, our effort . should be directed to  As used in this paper, the term "nuclear refers to any military device of any size or purpose Which utilizes energy released in the course of nuclear fission or fusion. 4 NSC 56021 r- ft iL   1055 .

Destroying or neutralizing the international Communist apparatus in the free world, 7. To carry out cffectiyely this general strategy Will require a flexible combination of military, political, economic, psychological, and covert actions Which enables the full exercise of U. 5. initiative. These- actions must be so coordinated as to reinforce one another. Programs for carrying out this general strategy should be developed and conducted as a matter of urgency With special emphasis in the period before the Soviets achieve nuclear parity. 8. Provided that it is resolutely pursued, this general  strategy offers the best hope of bringing about at least a prolonged period of armed truce, and ultimately a peaceful resolution of the Soviet bloc-free World conflict and a psaceful and orderly World environment, Failure resolutely to pursue this general strategy could. Within a relatively short span of years, place the United States in great jeopardy. 1056  NSC 56021
