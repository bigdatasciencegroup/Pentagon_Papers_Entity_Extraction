The intelligence estimate of the political, economic, and military situation in Vietnam through mid-1957 concludes that (1) DRV will not attempt an invasion of South Vietnam; (2) the trend toward stability in South Vietnam will continue barring invasion, guerrilla action, or death of Diem; (3) basic economic progress will be slow; and (4) significant sect resistance has been eliminated, but 8-10,000 armed communists pose a serious internal sccurity problem.

Essentially, it is concluded that the DRV remains in firm control even though there have been outbreaks of sporadic violence, that the DRV would attack only if Moscow and Peiping were sure that .the U.S. would . not intervene, and that the DRV will continue its tactics of "peaceful competition."

In general, the U.S. is achieving its objectives in Vietnam. Major problems which exist consist of the continued dependence on foreign aid, political and security problems of the Diem Government.

The principle objectives of U.S. policy should be (1) preservation of territorial and political integrity of Asian nations against communist expansion, (2) deterrence of local or general war, (3) bring about desirable changes in the Communist Bloc, (4) strengthen the economic, political and military position of the Free Far East, (5) promote Free World unity, and (6) identify the U.S. with Asian aspirations. NSC Memorandum for the Planning Board, 29 June 1959.. H96 The JCS submits their and the Services' views on U.S. policy in the Far East. "The U.S. faces a delicate problem in presenting its Far Eastern policy to the world. A U.S. policy will not be very sympathetically received if it is presented in the purely negative terms of preventing communist expansion or the reduetion of its power." JCS Memorandum-for NSC Staff, 14 July 1959.. 1211 A resurgence of tensions between Vietnam and Cambodia threatens to frustrate U.S. objectives in Cambodia. In Vietnam the Diem Government continues its strong controls which antagonise the Vietnamese elite. "Vietnamese military forces have improved under the MAAG training program." OCB Report on Southeast Asia, 12 August 1959... 1236 An intelligence analysis of Communist capabilities and intentions in Laos concludes that the Communist resumption of guerrilla warfare in Laos is a reaction to initiatives of U.S. support of Laos. The chances of Communist success are high at a low risk. Non-Asian forces intervening in Laos increase the likelihood of Communist invasion, but preference would be to diplomacy, propaganda, and guerrilla action to cause the West to back down.

The evolution of politicaI conditions necessitates that policy guidance should be directed at the problem of dealing with Sihanouk of Cambodia,' "by all odds the major single factor in Cambodia and the principal .target of U.S. policy." Further, the guidance of NSC 5809 is not adequate, to.cope with the situation in Laos. OCB SpecialReport on Southeast Asia, 10 February 1960... 1249 295. The Vietnam Country Team prepares a special report on the current security situation in Vietnam', "...the rural population is generally apathetic towards the Diem Government and there are signs of considerable dissatis-faction and silent opposition." Without support of the rural population, no final solution can be found to the internal security problem. Militarily, the GVN organi-zation lacks unity of command. The situation is summed up. "..the government has tended to treat the population with suspicion or to coerce it and has been rewarded with an attitude of apathy or resentment." Saigon 278 to State, 7 March 1960. 1254 296. Williams testified that he was working "MAAG out of a job" and this is impressive to Senator Mansfield and the Foreign Relations Committee. Mansfield requests information on the situation which not requires "the addition of 350 men to the MAAG." Mansfield. Letter to Lt General Williams, 5 May 1960... 1276 297. Williams replies that the 350 spaces referred to are the TERM personnel now in deactivation. The turnover of TERM spaces to MAAG ends the "subterfuge as actually TERM has had the undercover mission as logistical advi-sers since activation."

Specifically, he recommends shifting the MAAG function emphasis to assistance on tactical operations, increasing the MAAG staff, priority be given to furnishing selective equipment, more emphasis on counter-guerrilla intelligence training, and certain actions on activities of the Civil Guard, civic action, and MAP requiring interagency coordination. Lansdale Memorandum for ISA, 13 September 1960... 1307 302. The Diem regime is confronted by two separate, but related dangers a non-communistic coup attempt in Saigon and gradual Viet Cong extension of control in the countryside. U.S. objectives rest on a strongly anti-communist but popularly supported government; continued failures by Diem is cause to seek alternative leaders. Saigon 624 to State, 16 September 1960.. 1311 303. The U.S. suggests numerous political actions to President Diem, among them are Cabinet changes, more responsibility for Cabinet members, alteration of the Can Lao Party from a secret organisation to a normal political party, in-vesti.gation of Government departments by the National Assembly, freer press functions,, and measures to enhance, the Government's support in rural areas. In addition, it is suggested that Ngo Dinh Mhu, the Presidents brother, oe given an ambassadorial post outside the country.

Ambassa-dor Durbrow has apparently lost "personal stature" with Diem and should be removed. Lansdale Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 11 November 1960 1328 308. Diem nay react firmly toward the coup leaders since there are similarities to the circumstances of the 1954 attempt. Also Diem is probably now very suspicious of Ambassador Dvrbrow.

Allied vs Neutral Countries. a. Question To what extent should the degree of alignment with the Free World determine the U. S. attitude toward the countries of Southeast Asia, particularly as regards economic, technical and military assistance? b. Answer (1) U. S. attitudes toward the countries of Southeast Asia should be governed by U. S. national objectives. U. S. objectives must be based upon what is obtainable and therefore will vary from country to country. These objectives range from retention of positive support for U. S. positions to the prevention of any additional Communist influence in neutral nations. (2) The above notwithstanding, it is generally in U. S. interests to give preference to Allied nations who share in the belief that regional alliances are the only effective way to deter further Communist aggression. This should include special consideration for U. S. allies in the granting of economic, military and technical assistance. However, this should not preclude the granting of a substantial amount of aid to a neutral nation in preference to an allied nation, when it has been determined to be in the national interest to do so. In granting aid to neutral nations the US should declare its respect for the opinions of those nations, bu' the US should at the same time make clear that it does not agree with the logic of their positions. 2. Relative Weight of Assistance Programs. a. Question What proportion of U. S. resources available for assistance to Southeast Asia should be allocated to economic and technical assistance as against military assistance? Should greater emphasis be placed on operating an expanding number of technically-competent, proWestern leaders and on "political warfare" activities, at the expense of economic assistance, if necessary? Reproduction of this document Regrading data cannot in whole or in part is pro- be predetermined. hibited except with permission of the issuing office. Copy 1 of 10 copies. Page 1 of 3 pages. 1061 .     b. Answer A major proportion of U.S. resources available for assistance to Southeast Asia should be allocated to economic and technical assistance. Greater emphasis should be placed on creating an expanding number of technically competent, pro-Western leaders and on "political warfare" activities, at the expense of economic assistance, if necessary. Grant military assistance should, in general, be limited to those nations which either are threatened by Communist aggression or are willing to provide forces for collective defense measures in support of common-commitments. Reimburseable military assistance should be extended to allied nations capable of bearing the cost and to other nations which are ineligible for grant assistance but are willing to develop their own capabilities to resist Communism. 3. Absolute Level of Assistance a. Question Should the absolute level of U.S. economic, technical and military assistance to Southeast Asia be increased, decreased, or maintained at present levels in the light of the current Soviet campaign of political and economic penetration? b. Answer The absolute level of U.S. economic, technical and military assistance should be maintained at present levels in the light of the current Soviet campaign of political and economic penetration. However, in neutralist countries, military assistance should be decreased where it is in excess of the needs for maintaining internal security. 4. Functions of Indigenous Military Forces a. Question Should indigenous military forces in Southeast Asia be designed (a) solely to maintain internal security, (b) to maintain internal security and assist local external Communist aggression, or (c) in addition to (a) and (b), to contribute to collective defense efforts in the area? b. Answer Indigenous military forces in Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines should be designed to maintain internal security, to resist local external Communist aggression and to contribute to collective defense efforts in the area. Indigenous military forces in South Vietnam should be designed to maintain internal security and resist Viet Ninh overt Communist aggression. Military forces of other Southeast Asian nations should be designed solely to maintain internal security. 5. U.S. Response to Aggression a. Question What political and military action should the U.S. be prepared to undertake alone or in cooperation with allies in ' the event of Communist seizure of control within, or overt aggression ' against, a Southeast Asian country? What would be the role of SEATO in these eventualities? -2- Page 2 of 3 pages 1062 .     9 b. Answer The U.S. should be prepared to intervene, prefer-ably with other SEATO nations, in the event of Communist overt aggression against Southeast Asia. SEATO military forces should function under a Unified Command, perhaps in the name of the United Nations. 6. Communist Activities a. Question What can the U.S. do to remedy the existing lack of adequate Free world capabilities for countering Communist subversion and penetration? Should the U.S. oppose or attempt to match all Communist activities in Southeast Asia or should Communist-bloc trade, technicians, and investments be tolerated within certain limits? b. Answer The U.S. should not oppose or attempt to match all Communist activities in Southeast Asia. With a careful selection of projects, US aid can show the greater advantages of western methods. 7, Colonialism a. Question Should the U.S. uniformly oppose the continuance of colonialism or should it assist its European Allies to retain strategic outposts against Communist penetration in Southeast Asia? b. Answer The U.S. should oppose the continuance of colonialism. However, an exception should be made when colonies, e.g. Hong Kong, serve as strategic outposts against Communist penetration. V. P.

To analyze the current political, economic, and military situation in NOrth and SOuth Vietnam and to estimate probable developments through mid-1957. CONCLUSIONS 1. We believe that the Communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) will not attempt an open invasion of South ' Vietnam or a large scale guerrilla war fare effort during the period of this estimate because Of the danger of US or possibly SEATO counteraction and because such action would prejudice Bloc emphasis on peaceful coexistence elsewhere. The COmmunist regime will almost certainly remain in firm political eontroI throughout the period Of this estimate, despite some passive resistance and serious economic difficulties. It will require continued large scale Bloc aict to make even limited progress toward developing a self-supporting economy. The DRV army will retain the capability Of defeat-. in" the total forces of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. (Paras. 7-11, 1316, 18-21, 64-68) ' 2. In South Vietnam, the trend toward political stability and popular confidence in the government will probably continue, barring a DRV invasion, large scale guer- rilla action, or the death of Diem. Nevcr-theless, such contingent developments as intensified Bloc support for DRV objec tives or reduction in Diems international support could stimulate greater Communist subversive, pressure, weaken the South Vietnam governments confidence, cause some loss of its public support, and revive opposition efforts for reconciliation with the north. (Paras. 35-39,69-72) 3. Progress toward resolving basic economic problems will probably continue slow, but economic, conditions in South Vietnam are not likely tO have sericus adverse politioa.l effects during the next year, as rice production, rubber export's, and large scale US aid provide reasonable living standards.

All significant sect resistance in Scuth I Vietnam has been eliminated, but some 8,00010,000 armed Communists and a Communist political network scattered through the villages continue to posc a serious internal security problem.

INTRODUCTION 5 Under the terms of thc 1954 Gcncva Accords on Indochina, the Area of Vietnam north of the 17th parallel was placed under the administration of the Vietnamese Communists, Thc French assumed responsibility for implementation of the Armistice provisions in thc area south of the l7th parallel, but neither the French nor the Diem government, has acknowledged responsibility for implementing thc political settlement envisaged in the Final Declaration o. thc confeience. 6 Thc UK and the USSR, as co-chairmen of the Gcncva conference, met in London in April and May 1956 and reaffirmed support for the political settlement foreseen at Gc-neva but implicitly approved postponement of its implementation, including the nationwide elections. The co-chairman called upon all parties to' preserve the status quo and requested the International Supervisory and Control Commission (ICC) to continue supervising the Armistice. Thus no steps have been taken to bring about unification or a political settlement in Vietnam, and the partitioning of Vietnam has been tacitly accepted by thc Geneva conference powers for an indefinite period of time. In the meantime, the Communist regime in the north and the Diem government in the south have been developing their own institutions and preparing for an extend-cd period of struggle for control 'of Vietnam. II. NORTH VIETNAMCURRENT SITUATION AND TRENDS 7. Thc Communist Party of Vietnam (commonly called the Viet Minh) and its governmental apparatus, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DIfV) continue to exercise flrm and effective control over the estimated 13 million inhabitants of North Vietnam. Although critically lacking in technically trained personnel, thc Communist regime possesses a large number of experienced po litical workers and has made considerable progress in developing an effective administrative machine. It has strengthened its con-troI despite severe food shortages, continued passive resistance to its internal poIicics, and thc gradual reduction of its prospects for early domination of all Vietnam. 8. Ho Chi Minh continues to occupy a preeminent position among Vietnamese Communist leaders, despite somc de-emphasis of his public role. His prestige as a nationalist lead-cr is still a significant factor in the attitude of many people in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia toward thc Vietnamese Communist regime. Power relationships at the level be-lov Ho are not clear, but party Secretary Truong Chinh, Premier and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, and army conimandcr Vo Nguyen Giap appear to share top level responsibilities. Wc have no evidence of policy or personal differences among these three men or of the existence of "pro-Chinese and pro-Sovict factions in the party. 9. The regimes primary concern in thc. past year has been, to dcvclop more effective controls over thc people and the economy and to deal with such immediate problems as rehabilitation, malnutrition, widespread disease, famine, tightening of thc party apparatus, and the development of the armed forces. Although violence and inthnida on have been employed selectively, the Communists have so far refrained from the publicized, widespread terror employed in Communist China during the consolidation period m 1951-1952. Strenuous efforts are still being made to rally popular support behind front groups on the basis of nationalist and unification slogans. The most important of these is Thc Fatherland Front which is designed not only to mobilize support in the north for immediate reconstruction tasks but also to attract support in South Vietnam for Communist efforts to unify thc country. SECRET 1068      SECRET . 3 10. The Catholic population of approximately 750,000 appears to bc thc main center of pessive resistance to Communist indoctrination and DRV control. The Communists ap-pear to have recognized thc special nature of the Catholic problem and, probably with an eye both to reducing opposition and impress-ing the evacuees in the south, havc moved slowly to restrict church activities. At thc same time, they are attempting to weaken the hold of the clergy over thc communicants by various means including visits of puppet priests from Eastern Europe. To date the Vietnamese Catholic hierarchy appears to have been fairly successful in maintaining its position among thc Catholic population. 1E The substantial ethnic minorities, who live outside the river deltas, havc an ingrained dislike for all Vietnamese and there have been some instances of armed opposition by the tribal groups of north and northwest Tonkin. To integrate these minorities politically and to lessen their opposition to Communist lead-ership, the DRV has established "autonomous administrative areas nominally controlled by tribal dignitaries loyal to the Communists. In any event, Communist military and secu-rity forces are capable of eliminating any active resistance in the north. Economic Policies unci Courses of Acncn 12. The regime is moving gradually to extend its control over all aspects of the economy but it has not yet attempted detailed over-all planning, the nationalization of 'small productive units md domestic trade, or the col- leetivization of agriculture. At present, the regime is attempting to deal with immediate problems on. the following priority (a) in-creasing agricultural production; (b) restoring the transportation network; and (c) re-habilitating export industries, e. g., coal, ce-ment, phosphates, and textile and other light industries. Thus far the regime has not be-gun to stress heavy industrial development and is concentrating a major portion of its industrial production on consumer goods. ' J3. The regimes major economic problem is to meet the minimum consumption needs of the population while developing a self-sup porting economy. Prior to 1954 the annual rice deficit of North Vietnam avcraged about 200,000 metric tons. As a result of wartime damage to irrigation facilities and an unprecedented series of floods, droughts, and insect scourges, thc rice deficit in each of the past two years has amounted to at lcast 500,000 metric tons. With shipments from South Vietnam cut to a trickle since 1954, the DRV appealcd to the Bloc for relief. However, imports through April 1956, consist-ing of token shipments from Communist China and some 200,000 tons of Burmese rice purchased by the USSR, have fallen far short of minimum requirements. In Dccember 1955 the DRV announced that the per capita food consumption in that year had dropped at times to as low as 500 calories per day. 14. There will probably be sonic improvement in thc food situation in 1956-1957. The USSR has agreed to accept up to 400,000 tons of Bur-mese rice each year through 1953. It is likely that thc Burmese will actually .ship a high percentage of this figure and that, the DHV will receive a major share of this rice. Although thc spring crop in 195G will probably again fall below normal because of continued adverse weather, the cxtensive efforts of the regime to mobilize all segments of thc popu-lation for irrigation repair, reclamation of abandoned land, cultivation of new land, and planting of subsidiary crops should lead to a gradual increase in domestic output. 15. However, North Vietnam will not achieve self-sufficiency in rice in thc next few years even with optimum weather conditions. Planned investment to increase the supply of fertilizers, pumps, improved seeds, and agricultural implements appears insumcicnt to achieve a substantial increase in output in the near future. Moreover, the current pro-gram for redistribution of land will probably depress production. 1G. Rehabilitation of modern industries has gone slowly due to a lack of raw materials, technicians, and equipment. Coal production in 1955 is estimated to have been about 700,-000 tons compared to 900,000 tons under thc French in 1953 and the pre-World War U peak of 2,600,000 tons. Thc rate may reach SECRET 106S .     SECRET 800,000 to 1,000,000 tons in 195G, permitting an export of 300,000-500,000 tons. By thc end of 1956 cement production may reach its former annual rate of 300,000 tons. The large textile plant at Nam Dinh returned to limited production in Dccember 1955 but even when operating at. full capacity it will provide only about half of North Vietnams requirements and it is dependent on imported cotton. 17. With Chinese Communist technical and manpower assistance, rapid progress has been made in restoring transportation and communication facilities. Thc rail link from Hanoi to the Chinese border at Nam Quan has been restored and thc Haiphong-Kunming line will probably be fully restored this year. Tills construction will link southwest China with sea transport at Haiphong and the main Chinese rail system at Nam Quan. Thc line from Hanoi to the 17th parallel is also being rehabilitated and it is possible that service south to Vinh will be established by the end of thc year. With Chinese assistance, the DRV has also made rapid progress in rehabili- fating North Vietnam's highway system. A bridge building program for 195S is aimed at eliminating most of the ferries on primary roads. Rehabilitation of the Hanoi-Lai Chau route and of roads south from Hanoi toward thc l7th parallel will facilitate the movement of troops and supplies to any point along the borders of Laos and South Vietnam.- Sovict assistance is making possible the improvement of port facilities at Haiphong which will further expedite the distribution of Bloc military and economic supplies. 18. The chronic deficit in thc balance of payments position of the North Vietnam area has bccn deepened by the failure to restore agricultural and industrial production and by the abnormal requirements for foreign goods and . technical aid. The foreign exchange position has also been worsened by the break in complementary trade relations with thc south. A measure of the deficit and of thc critical  economic situation is suggested by the magni-tucie of Eloc grants to the DEV. In July 1955, Communist China granted the sum of 800,000,000 yuan (about $330,000,000 at official rates) and thc USSR promised 400,000,000 rubles ($100,000,000 at official rates). Smaller grants have been extended by several of the European Satellites. A substantial portion of thc aid received has bccn in thc form of consumer goods. 19. Wc believe that during the period of this estimate thc DRV will continue to concentrate, with moderate success, on efforts to increase agricultural, mineral, and light industry production. The DRV has the resources to increase exports and to support a modest industrial development. However, at least for several years, it will require substantial Bloc assistance to support cvcn a minimum standard of living and there appears little prospect for substantial forced saving to support rapid industrialization in the near future. DRV Military Strength . 20. The Vietnam Peoples Army (VPA) now has a total strength of about 266,000 men organized in 16 infantry divisions, 2 artillery divisions, 1 AAA groupment, 10 separate infantry regiments, and 5 border and coastal security regiments. As the VPA continues its evolution toward a modern force, several more divisions may be organized using existing separate regiments. Although further t substantial increases in the numerical strength of the army appear unlikely, a ready . pool of semitrained manpower exists among the 117,000 men now in regional and popular troop units. Thc recent announcement by thc DRV of a troop reduction probably reflects the release of unfit personnel since thc Armistice. 21. More extensive training was probably made possible by reduced commitments to internal security missions and reconstruction projects, and multidivisional maneuvers were reported in late 1955. We believe that about half of the major combat units are combatready and the remainder probably will reach that status during 1956. Even at. its present level of training, thc VPA. is capable 0; defeating the total military forces of South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. 22. There were no significant changes in the dispositions of VPA units during the past SECRET 1070 .     SECRET year and the largest concentration remains in thc Delta region, approximately 300 miles . from the 17th parallel. However, clandestine guerrilla operations, including infiltration of small units, could be conducted against South Vietnam and Laos without major troop movements. 23. Thc Vietnamese. Communists have no combat air capabilities at thc present time, but some air training probably is underway in Communist China. It is possible that thc DRV will have one or two regiments of piston fighters operational in 1957. There are 26 former French air fields in North Vietnam, five of which could be used with little or no dcvelopment to support sustained operations by Communist jet fighters, and one of which could probably support sustained jet light bomber operations. The DRV has no scpa- ' rate naval organization and coastal defense ' depends on small armed craft and ground patrols. DRV External Relations and Policies 24. Relations with the frloc. We believe that the DRV is firmly committed to the policies of thc Sino-Soviet Bloc, even to the extent of subordinating or postponing the pursuit of its local or regional objectives in the interest of over-all Eloc tactics and strategy. The attitude of DRV leadership follows from its Communist world outlook and from the fact that DRV objectivescan only be realized with Sino-Soviet Bloc support. 25. Despite its close ties with and dependence on Pciping and Moscow, the DRV on occasion acts in less conformity with the. Bloc than thc European Satellites. A number of consid-erations account for this special status. The Vietnamese Communists fought their own .fight against French colonialism. The DRV possesses an army and security organization which was devcloped prior to 1950 independ-ently of Sino-Soviet nr ferial assistance. Thc appearance of relative independence created by some DRV actions may, nevertheless, serve to further Bloc interests elsewhere in South-east Asia. 26. Over the past year, Bloc economic and diplomatic support may not have met DRV expectations. Bloc deliveries of rice have been far below levels necessary to prevent widespread debility in North Vietnam. Mi-koyans visit to Hanoi in April 1956, the first by a major Soviet official, was made a great public occasion and DRV propaganda suggested some expectation that new aid or economic agreements might result. No new Soviet-DRV arrangements were announced, however, and in fact Mikoyan departed with-out issuance of the usual joint communique. ! The USSR also failed to press DRV demands either for the strict implementation" of the 1 Geneva Agreements with respect to north- 1 south consultations and elections, or for re- ' convening the Geneva conference. The So- ( viet position, as it developed at the A.pril-?Way Gcncva co-chairmen talks, acccpts maintenance of the status quo for thc time being. Although the Chinese Communists have been more forthright in supporting the stated DRV position, thc Soviet Union has shown no dis-position to support the DRVs basic objective of securing control of all Vietnam at thc risk of jeopardizing Soviet policy objectives in other areas or the Blocs campaign of em-phasizing friendship and reducing tensions. 27. The rather aloof position of the USSR, which increases the dependence of the VieL namese Communists on Communist China, may be disappointing to the DRV. Some ele-ment of thc traditional Vietnamese distrust of the Chinese probably survives among Vietnamese Communist leaders, despite the bond of Marxism, and the DRV may well wish that ' it could counter Chinese induer . with closer Soviet tics. 28. Substantial differences over policy toward South Vietnam, and possibly 1 os, may de-velop between the DRV and the USSR and Communist China if prospects for an early extension of Communist control to South Viet-nam continue to decline Even in this pvent, however, and despite the DRVs potential capacity for independent action, we believe that other considerations would prevail to cause the DRV to continue its loyal adherence to the Bloc. SECRET 1071 .    By NWD Dale 2011 SECRET 29. Policies Toward South Vietnam. Lackin full Bloc support for its reunification . demands and recognizing that thc July 1956 deadline for elections would not 'be met, the DRV is now adjusting its policies for the longer pull. The regimes public position that thc Geneva provisions must be fulfilled and that nationwide elections must be hcld remains unchanged. However, the DRV is now playing down thc demand for early reconven-inr of thc Geneva conference and increasing its demands for direct north-south consultations. The DRV has accepted thc position taken by thc Soviet Union at the London talks that the ICC and Joint Armistice Commission should continue their functions despite the dissolution of the French High Command. The DRV has also enlarged the scopc of its . diplomatic activity to enhance its international prestige and position and to secure the broadest possible foreign support for eventual . implementation of the Geneva Agreements. 30. At the same time, the DRV has main tained its network of political and paramilitary Cadres in the south. It has continued its efforts to penetrate the government of South Vietnam and probably is maintaining contact with non-Communist but. anti-Diem Vietnamese, chiefly those now in exile, who favor conciliation with the north. Through use of nationalist themes and front organizations, it is attempting to retain popular iol-lowing in the south.;1'Ninety-five thousand . men were evacuated from the south in the first few months following the Armistice. The' DRV probably views this group as a possible instrument for subversive activity in South Vietnam and some may have been retrained, i reindoctrinated, and perhaps even reinfil. tratcd.1 31. Policies Toward Laos and Cambodia. The Communist rebel movement in Laos, the Pathct Lao, is completely dependent on DRV support and assistance to maintain its position in thc northern provinces. Although thc DRV continues to support the Pathet Lao, it has begun to soften its line toward the Royal I-no government. In place of its earlier criticism of the Lao government, the DRV now praises the Lao governments professed G adherence to the "five principles of cocxist-cncc, encourages Laos to adopt a neutral foreign policy and to enter into dircct consultations with the Pathct Lao to resolve their differences. 32. DRV policy toward Cambodia encourages neutralism and the establishment of wider contacts bctwecn thc Cambodian government and the Communist world. The Hanoi radio has virtually eliminated its previously bitter condemnation of the Cambodian government and is now extravagant in its praise of Cambodian foreign policy and its "resistance to alleged US plots to undermine Cambodian independence. Future DRV policies with respect to Laos and Cambodia will probably reflect thc guidance of Moscow and Peiping. 33. Policies Toward Other Countries. In its relations with other states in .Asia, the DRV has attempted to increase support for its position on unification, to further thc general Eloc peace campaign, and to obtain diplomatic contacts and recognition-. At present, North Vietnam is rccognizcd by all Eloc countries, but no non-Bloc country has extended full diplomatic recognition. India and Indonesia have exchanged consular representatives with both North and South Vietnam and Burma has permitted the DRV to maintain an Information O.Tice in Rangoon. The DRV has taken special pains to woo the Iridian delegates to the ICC. 34. Thc DRV has severely curtailed remaining French cultural activities in North Vict-nam and the much publicized commercial arrangements have been too restrictive to hold or attract any significant economic activity by thc French. However, the DUV has won French agreement to the establishment of a commercial and cultural mission in Paris. Its presence will complicate French relations with Dicm and facilitate thc maintenance of DRV influence among Vietnamese resident in France. III. SOUTH VIETNAMCURRENT SITUAT1ON AND TRENDS Politico! 35. During the past year President Ngo Dinh Diems government has greatly strengthened SECRET IC 72      SECRET 7 its internal political position in South Viet-nam a country with an estimated population of 12 million. ' The national referendum in October 1955 established the legitimacy of thc Government of Vietnam (GVN), and com-pletcd the elimination of Bao Dai as Chief '? . of State and as a major political factor in South Vietnam. By the end of March 1956, Diem reduced. the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao  groups to political impotence by a series of moves which culminated in the elimination' . of the Cao Dai army as an independent mili- ; i tary force and the capture, trial, and execu- r tion of Ba Cut, the last important active Hoa 1! Hao resistance, leader36. oh4 March 1356, in South Vietnams first ... national elections, SO percent, of the eligible  ,, voters participated in electing 123 deputies from 405 candidates for the Constituent As-. ...- sembly. The returns gave pro-Diem forces a . substantial majority. Although nearly one- third of the government-favored candidates i.i were defeated, no openly anti-Dicm deputy. N i . was elected. This was due in part to govern- ;? .u ment manipulation of the election campaign ?  and in part to a boycott of the elections by  most of the opposition parties. Despite efforts I bv thc Vietnamese Communists and other ! resistance groups to disrupt and sabotage the  voting, thc elections generally were calm and j orderly. The Constituent Assembly will sit for a four-year term as the first National Assembly. 37. Thc deputies in thc Constituent Assembly; which convened 15 March, are divided among political parties as follows National Revolu-tionary Movement (NRM), 61; Revolutionary Workers Party (RWP), 15; Citizens Rally (CK), 26; Movement of Struggle for Freedom (MSF), 6; and Independents (including onc Dai Vici), 15. The NRM is the Diem govern-ments primary source of organized political power. Although Information Minister Tran Chanh Thanh is its titular head, a large part of thc party is controlled by Diems brother, Ngo Dinh Can, who controls Central Vietnam. The RWP, also a government party, is led by Diem's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu. While thc CR, MSF, and most Independents now support Diem, they contain some members  who havc reservations about some of Diems methods and are potential centers of parliamentary opposition. 38. Diem will probably maintain his dominant political position in South Vietnam dm-, ing the period of this estimate. The constitution, which has been drafted under Diems supervision, gives the President wide powers including the right to appoint the first Vice President and to suspend civil rights during thc lifc of the first Assembly. Diems personal prestige will probably be enhanced by im-provement in internal security and by continued frustration of Vietnamese Communist objectives. However, he will continue to face serious problems in attracting additional active support for his government, in part because of his reliance on a small circle of relatives and trusted friends. While Diems con-trol of thc Assembly during the period of this estimate will probably bc adequate to insure adoption of any important measure he wishes enacted, his inclination to hold a tight rein on the legislature may accelerate thc dcvclop-mcnt of an active opposition. 39. The appointment of a Vice President by Dicm, now 55, will remove much uncertainty over presidential successorship. Neverthe- 4 less, Diems death, whether by natural causes or assassination, could result in serious fac-tional disputes in the government and among the major political parties which could strain the new governmental institutions. Ngo Dinh Nhu and Tran Chanh Thanh, key figures in the RWP and NRM, have a great deal of political power and would play important roles in any redistribution of power, but neither of these men- has a wide popular foHow-ing. To some government critics and govern-ment supporters Thanh symbolizes thc more regressive features of the Diem regime. At the moment, Secretary to the President and Acting Minister of the Interior Nguyen Huu Chau appears to enjoy Diems .favor and has grown rapidly in stature and power, but he has no organized political backing apart from his support by Diem and Nhu. Ngo Dinh Can would probably play an important behind-the-scenes role in any redistribution of power, but his lack of national stature and poor SECRET 1073      SECRET 8 health would almost certainly rule him out as a leading contender for leadership. Tran . Van I,am, leader of thc CR, is ambitious and enjoys considerable popularity in the -south-ern provinces, but his political position is weak. Although the army high command has been trying to keep the army out of poli-tics, the prestige and strength of the army vouldahnost certainly play a major and possi-bly decisive role in the redistribution of politi-cal power. Thc numerous anti-Diem nationalists in South Vietnam and France would probably attempt to re-enter the picture and their maneuvers would add to thc confusion. How-ever, many of these men are discredited be-cause of their past rotations with Bao Dai the French, or the Communists, and it is ' doubtful that, any of them could muster suf- ficient backing to gain control. Economic 40. South Vietnam is normally an apricul-.tural surplus area, exporting rice and rubber During- World War II and the civil war periods large portions of cultivated land were abandoned and the transportation and irri-gation systems deteriorated. Current rice production is less than two-thirds the pre-World War II Ievcls, and exports in 1955 w ere only about 100,000 tons as compared with thc prewar annual total of more than one million tons. Current rubber output of 54,000 tons exceeds the prewar level by about 10,000 tons and rubber has replaced rice as South Viet-nams leading foreign exchange earner. In 1955, high market prices raised thc value of South Vietnams rubber exports almost 80 per-cent above 1954 and to more than, half the value of all exports. 41. Because of the decline in rice exports and the large imports of consumer goods and, to a lescl extent, capital goods for rehabilitation South Vietnam is running a large deficit in its balance of payments. In 1954 exports covered 17 percent of imports white in 1,955 even vith unusually high rubber prices, ex-ports covered only 25 percent of imports.' At present, US aid is filling thc gap and is an important factor in thc relatively high standards of living prevalent in much of South Vietnam. For the fiscal years 1955 and 1956 the planncd level of US economic and military aid for South Vietnam totaled approximately $520 million (not including thc value of US equipment already in Vietnam and trans-ferrcdto the GVN). At present the US is financing about 90 percent of thc GVN military budget, 65 percent of the combined mili-tary-civilian budget, and 75 percent of all South Vietnams imports. 42. The withdrawal of French military forccs, the termination of Frances preferential trade status, and the loosening of French-Vietna-mese political ties have combined to curtail the scale of French industrial and commercial activity in South Vietnam. French business interests are withdrawing about as rapidly as Vietnamese restrictions on currency transfers permit. .South Vietnams import trade is moving away from France toward Japan and thc US. In 1953 and 1954, France supplied about. 80 percent of South Vietnams imports. In 1955 thc figure dropped to 50 percent and the downward trend is continuing. In the same two-year period, Japans share of South Vietnams imports has increased from three to 12 percent. 43. The GVN has not. yet efl'cctively come to grips with its economic problems. President Diem has stated that 1956 will be a year of economic consolidation, but through thc first six months of the year, GVN attention con-tinued to be focused on security and political . issues. Only the most pressing economic problems havc received serious government attention and those havc generally been dealt with by ad hoc methods or authoritarian de-crecs. For example, the government has at-tempted to cope with a serious threat of infla-tion by a series of decrees controlling prices and inventories for many items and cstablish-ing high fmcs and even the death penalty for attempts to corner the market. These meas-ures have contributed little to preventing in-flation and have aroused the, resentment of the important Chinese community. Inflation-ary pressures have been held in check pri-marily because the government has been able, with US aid, to maintain a fairly high level of imports of consumer goods. SECRET lC7h .     SECRET 9 44. Progress has been slow in thc resettlement of refugees and in the implementation of other measures to increase agricultural production. The limited land reform program inaugurated in 1953 is unattractive to the peasant in cornparison with extravagant Communist prom-iscs. Landlords arc objecting to thc low rents provided for in the program and their opposition plus the general lack of official determination and administrative competence has led to the stagnation of land reform. 45. Nevertheless, the GVN has made some progress in building the organizational structure necessary to replace institutions of the French colonial period. The GVN has created an independent national bank, a foreign exchange office, an investment fund, a government-owned commercial bank, and an indcpendent currency. President Diem has proposed establishment of a High Economic. Council to guide the countrys economic development and he has made informal reference to thc possibility of a four or five year plan for economic rehabilitation and development. In addition, government officials now administer a substantial import program and the application of a substantial US foreign aid program. Although these new institutions and economic activities provide an essential beginning for further economic progress, they arc not yet fully operative or elective. 46. Though South Vietnam cannot become economically self-supporting so long as it must maintain armed forces of the present size, its economic position could bc substantially improved by economic and fiscal reforms. ' However, during the period of this estimate there is little prospect for marked dcvclopmcnt of South Vietnams economy or for a significant reduction in its balance of trade and budget deficits. Inflationary pres-surcs are almost certain to continue. How-cver, thc food supply, a critical political fee-tor, is likely to be more than adequate for domestic needs. Provided security conditions continue to improve, thc GVN will probably give economic problems increased attention during the coming year and will probably bo able to make somc progress toward solution of several specific economic problems. A pro gram to resettle 100,000 refugees on abandoned land has been develops! and somc 40,000 of thesc have already been relocated. This project will probably be followed by further resettlement projects which arc likely to reduce substantially the refugee problem dur- ing thc estimate pcriod. Additional land will probably be brought under cultivation. Some improvement is likely in tax collection and in handling the problem of French disinvestment. By mid-l957, economic development planning will probably be well advanced, but concrete results are unlikely within the period. Military 47. Current strength of the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) is approximately 115,000 troops. Thc VNA is organized into 4 field infantry divisions (8,500), 6 light infantry  divisions (5,225), 1 airborne groupment (4,000), 13 territorial regiments, 5 separate sect regiments, and 15 assorted combat battalions. Although some progress has bccn made during the past year, the extensive plans for training and reorganizing the VNA have fallen behind schedule because most major units havc bccn dispersed with many of them engaged in security operations. Principal VNA vzeaknesses are an inadequate logistical and technical support system, an inc-fi'ec-tive chain o' command, and inexperience at the command and staff levels. At least six months of uninterrupted training will be necessary to bring the VNA to minimum opcra-tional effectiveness at envision level. VNA loyalty to President Diem and his policies seems assured. The armys s-lf-conAdence and morale are generally good. 48. When the French High Command was inactivated on 23 April 1953, all previous French-Vietnamese military agj ements were terminated. All French combat units have been withdrawn from Vietnam. .Iter 1 July, only a few French army personnel remained in South Vietnam, in addition to a 1,000-man French military support group for the ICC. The Vietnamese and the French are now negotiating concerning French support for the ICC and the French role in training the Viet-narne.se forces, particularly air and naval .    By NWD Dale 2011 SECRET 10 forces. The primary US-directed effort has bccn thc training of a Vietnamese instructor corps and thc development of training .programs throughout the Vietnamese army. US personnel are detailed to VNA training centers, to units at division level, and to major territorial commands to supervise progress and implementation of the training program. The US military group in -South Vietnam has been held to its pre-Gcneva size despite thc near complete withdrawal of the FTcnch mission, which totaled about 2,500 personnel prior to thc Armistice. However, a 350-man US Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission (TERrI) is being established in South Vict- nain. <9. South Vietnams embryonic air force (VNAF) has grown only slightly during thc past year. Its current strength of 3,338 includes 103 trained officer and enlisted pilots and 100 pilot trainees. VNAF aircraft inven. lory is 143 planes, mostly trainerliaison and . transport typcs. Although the air force is receiving F8F piston fighter-type planes, it ' is unable to maintain even limited flight oper- ations because of a lack of qualified maintenance personnel. The VNAF has a limited capability to provide air support to ground troops, artillery observation, air evacuation, liaison, and air lift for paratroop operations. No significant increase in VNAF capabilities . appears likely during the next two to three years. 50. South Vietnams navy is under operational control of the Chief of Staff of the VNA and under the adrnin.strativc command of a senior naval officer. Personnel strength is 142 ofn-' ccrs and 1,755 men, with a Marine Corps of 44 officers and 1,775 men. The forces afloat, which have been augmented over the past year by additions from the withdrawing French forces, include 3 submarine chasers (PC), 3 coastal .minesweepers (h-SC (O)), 14 arn-phibotts vessels (2 LSM, 2 LSSL, 5 LSIL, 5 LOU), and 170. smaller amphibious and . patrol craft. The Vietnamese navy has Jim. ited effectiveness, but it is capable of undertaking river patrol and minor coastal and amphibious operations. Capabilities should improve substantially in the near future be cause of continued US aid and intensive training programs which includc technical training in the US and France. 51. Wc believe South Vietnams military and sccurity forces arc capable of maintaining the government in power against any potential armed opposition now located'south of tire 17th parallel. jin the event of large scale, concei ted guerrilla" warfare supported by infiltration of men and supplies from thc north, relatively large areas of rural Vietnam prob- i ably would be lost to government control..In, thc event of full scale invasion, the Vietna-rnese forces at present probably could not delay for more than CO days a Vietnamese Communist advance to the Ban Me Thout-Nha Trang line. If the trona toward improved internal security and increased effectiveness of thc Civil Guard continues, it will be possible to step up training and reorganization of the VNA, thereby improving its capabilities during the pcriod of this estimate. However, by mid-l957 Victnamese forces will still be incapable of delaying for more than 90 days an advance by DRV forces beyond the Ban Me Thout-Nha' Trang line. Internal Security 52. The internal security situation in South Vietnam has improved substantially during the past year. The sects are no longer a major security problem for the GVN. Most of the important non-Communist sect leaders of a year ago have either Ceci the country, been killed or captured, lost control of their forces, or rallied to the government. Remaining sect armed bands are scattered and disorganized and probably total no more than 2,000. Although various bandit groups trill probably continue to cause local disturbances, it is likely that organised non-Comrnu ist resistance will virtually disapp car during the period of this estimate. 53. With thc sect problem basically under control, the Communist underground represents the only serious threat to internal security in South Vietnam. Reports on Communist armed strength in the south over the past year have ranged from 5,000 to 10,009. Our best, estimate of current strength is 8,000 to .     SECRET 10 000 with approximately 5,000 organized in skeletal company and battalion sized units which could bc expandcd through, recruit-mcnt. Those armed forces arc generally scattered through the mountains paralleling the Annam coast and the remote swampy regions of Cochin-China. They arc capablc of harass-in0- actions against VNA outposts and of widc- SOrcad intimidation,'assassination, sabotage, and terrorism, especialIy in rural areas. They could disrupt north-south traffic throughout Central Vietnam and interfere seriously with provincial and loCal administration. How! cvcr> any sustained guerrilla operations would  require a flow of reinforcements and supply ifrom the north. 54. The Communists have an unknown number of political cadres in the south engaged in ' subversive and propaganda activities. Although Communist cadres probably exercise effective control over some remote communities where the GVN has not yet attempted to establish its authority, and have somc influence in villages through much of South Vict-nam, over-all Vietnamese Communist political influence in thc south appears to havc dimin- ished during th.epast year. However, if the 'Communists(decide,to exercise their capability for armed intimidation and terror they could quickly reassert political control or influence,  at least in some rural areas where GVN authority is tenuous. b'") . 55. During the past year the Communists in South Vietnam have remained generally quiescent. They have passed by a number of ' . opportunities, to. embarrass the Diem regime.  Although some cadres and supplies arc being I , infiltrated across the 17th parallel, the DRV I probably has not sent any large scale rein- I -forccment or supply to the south. Communist activity in the south appears to concen--trate on protecting vital bases and supply caches, developing clandestine paramilitary organizations, and implementing a broad program of infiltration and subversion. While ' seekin" to maintain intact as much of their armed strength as possible, their main activity seems to be an effort to weaken the Diem gov-' eminent by subversive and political tactics.. Communist directives indicate that penetrar tion and subversion of the GVN military and 11 security forces is a major objective. Although there is little specific evidence, they probably havc penetrated lower echelons of thc VNA, especially the integrated sect forces, and probably hold positions of influence in somc provincial governments and village councils. Local Communist groups probably gavc somc assistance to thc Cao Dai and Moa Hao forces opposing the government. Since the collapse of sect armed resistance it is possible that the Communists are seeking to take over the remnants of the sect forces. I 56 The GVN has organized a Civil Guard to relieve the VNA of many static internal security duties. Current strength of thc Civil Guard is approximately 48,000 men organized in lightly-armed mobile companies. Its niis-sion is to maintain lav and order, collect intelligence, and conduct countersubversion operations at thc provincial level in areas pacified by the army. Although considerable progress and refinement in its training and organization will be necessary before the Civil Guard can fully discharge its responsibilities, it has shown considerable potential as an instrument for maintaining internal security. A 60,000-man village Self-Defense Corps (Dan Vc Doan) is being organized to provide security at the local level. Foreign Reciions ' 57. GVN foreign policy objectives are to win recognition as thc legitimate government of all Vietnam, to obtain maximum foreign military and economic aid and guarantees of for- . eign assistance in the event of Communist aggression, and to develop foreign support for its position with respect to the Geneva Agreements. Forty-one nations have recognized thc GVN. In addition, India and Indonesia maintain consular relations with the GVN. 58. President Diem consistently has maintained that South Vietnam is not bound by the 1954 Geneva Accords and has no legal responsibility for their implementation. He has refused to deal directly with thc DRV on any issue and has been steadfast in his rejection of all-Victnam ejections until democratic processes can be assured in North Vietnam. He believes that any consultations or implied recognition of thc DRV would havc SECRET IC I?       12 S E C It E T adverse political effects in thc south and could lead to increased internal and inter; national pressure for reunification ofViet-nam under a coalition government with the Communists. 59 His refusal to permit nationwide elections and to assume responsibilities under thc Geneva Accords raised the possibility of a vith-drawal of thc ICC following the deactivation of the French High Command in April. To deal with this situation, representatives of the Geneva co-chairmen (the UK and the USSR) met in Iondon during April and May 1956. Thc USSR failed to press DRV demands that thc co-chairmen reopen thc Geneva conference. Instead, thc co-chairmen finallv agreed upon identical letters to the DRV and GVN requesting them to prevent f ny violation of military clauses of thc Gc-neva Accords, to insure implementation of the political terms, to submit at the earliest pos-siblc time a convenient deadline for direct consultations and for holding all-Vietnam elections, and to give every assistance to the ICC. The co-chairmen requested the ICC to continue supervising the'Armistice. They requested the French government to continue its rood offices in support of the ICC, to reach agreement with the GVN to facilitate thc task of thc ICC and the Joint Armistice Commission (French-DRV), and to preserve the status quo until such new arrangements could be put into effect. CO Despite his past refusals to assume responsibilities under the Geneva Accords, in his response to thc co-chairmens message Diem agreed to respect the Armistice and to provide security for ICC members. He recognizes the deterrent value inherent in the presence of the ICC, and appears willing to take action necessary to continue its function but con-tinucs to avoid thc acceptance of any legal obligation under thc Geneva Accords. Cl. Franco-Vietnamese relations continue to reflect considerable ill-will and distrust on both sides. Recent causes of friction include disarrecnicnls concerning the future status and role of French military training missions, residual military base rights in South Vietnam and the equivocal French attitude to ward the Communist regime in the north. Thc French now exercise little influence in Vietnamese affairs and there is little prospect for any improvement in relations in the near future. G2. South Vietnam-US relations havc re-maincd close and friendly during the past year. There havc been few evidcnces of Vietnamese resentment of increasing US influence and activity in South Vietnam despite continual efforts by thc Communists and some local French to stir up dissatisfaction on that score. The GVN would like the US to raise; the mutually agreed ceiling on VNA force' lcvcls and desires greater autonomy in administering thc foreign aid program. Diem would also like the US to exercise maximum political pressure, especially on the UK, India, and France, to enable the GVN to avoid any responsibility for the Gcncva Accords. 63. Relations between South Vietnam and Cambodia have bccn strained by activities of resistance groups in border areas', by treatment of minority groups, by boundary disputes, and most seriously by disagreements relating to trade arrangements. A trade stoppage early in 1956 was removed through informal mediation by thc US, and by the terms of settlement official representatives have been exchanged for the first time. Thc basic causes of friction remain, hoyzever, Vietnam does not desire full diplomatic relations with Cambodia because it fears such action would lead to Cambodian recognition of the DRV as well. There arc no pressing problems in Lao-Vietnamese relations and South Vietnams re-.lations with the Philippines and Thailand are generally good. IV. THE OUTLOOK IN VIETNAA4 Probable Communist Courses of Action Toward South Vietnam 164. Thc DRV probably estimates that its Ichances for securing control of South Vietnam by.means short of open attack or'large T scale guerrilla action supported from thc 'I north will gradually diminish With thc passage of timei. As indicated by Soviet and Chinese Communist performance in the past S E C R E T i07S      13 SECRET several months, the DRV probably cannot expect strong support from thc Bloc for the strict implementation of the Gcncva Apree-ments. Thc lack of strong Bloc pressure strengthens international acceptance of the status quo in Vietnam and increases confidence in the future in South Vietnam. Al- though the DRV may still believe that it could obtain control of all Vietnam through 1CC supervised nationwide ejections, Viet-namese Communist leaders are probably in- ercasingly doubtful on this point because of their own internal difnculties and the growing nationalist, stature of Diem.fThe DRV probably also believes that its covert. .assets < I in South Vietnam will gradually decline if D the Diem government is permitted to concentrate on internal security and economic prob- j Icms free of external harassment, w 65. Dcspite the declining prospects for the peaceful take-over of South Vietnam, we believe that the USSR and Communist China will almost certainly continue unwilling to support open DRV military action against South Vietnam during thc period of this esti-matc. They are probably unwilling to risk the chance of US or SEATO intervention which would make it difficult to limit the con-flict to Vietnam, and probably belicvc that overt DRV military action would seriously un-dercut thc worldwide effort of the Bloc to. win friends arid supporters. Although the DRV retain the capability to launch an independ- ent military action against South Vietnam, the chances of such action in the absence of assured Bloc ' upport appear to be extremely small- '. (CG. Thc onIy remaining course of action hold-, 'ing out some promise for the early achicve-J. ment of Communist control in South Vietnam ' appears to bo the development of large scale guerrilla warfare in the south. In recent weeks a number of reports from sources of untested reliability have indicated that the Communists mAy have started preparations in both South Vietnam and in the north to begin guerrilla action. DRV allegations of Vietnamese violations of thc demilitarized zone along the l7th parallel and Communist Claims of US-Dicrn plans to violate thc Annis-. tice could be propaganda cover for the initia-tion of guerrilla action against thc south. 67. However, the possible indications of armed action appear inconsistent with thc DRVs insistence on the continued functioning of the ICC which is in a position to make at least limited observations of DRV activities. More- , over, guerrilla action in South Vietnam, if it' were to be sustaincd and not to result simply in the identification and gradual elimination ' of Communist cadres, would, require large scale support from the north. This would in-1 volve some risk of detection by the ICC and of intervcntionby the US.and possibly SEATO. It would also tend to prejudice current Com-1 munist maneuvers elsewhere in Asia. For  thesc reasons, ve believe that the DRV will refrain from instituting large scale guerrilla action within South Vietnam during the period of this estimate. Communist capabili-ties for guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam will exist for somc time, however, and the chances of their being employed ivould prob-ably increase in thc event of any substantial deterioration in the domestic situation in South Vietnam such as might conceivably occur on thc death of Diem. Thc chances of Communist guerrilla warfare would also be increased by deterioration of the international aspects of the situation, such as a withdrawal of the ICC under circumstances which would permit the Communists to.place the blame, for this event on the GVN. C8. The DRV wih continue to seek maximum Bloc support for its objectives and will seek, within the limits of Bloc strategy, to harass and undermine the government in South Viet-nam. It will continue to seek direct contacts with South Vietnam, offering economic and cultural exchanges while castigating Diem for "blocking unification. It will continue efforts to pcnctrate thc government of South Vietnam and to improve its covert organization throughout the area. It may attempt to increase pressures for a reconvening of the Geneva conference and to unsettle the Diem government by fabricating or provoking inci-dents along the demarcation line and by demonstrations of armed strength within South Vietnam. SECRET 1 A 7 9    SECRET 14 Trent's in South Vietnam GO Barring a major Communist effort to disrupt the Diem regime by renewal.of large i scale guerrilla operations, thc over-all prospects for improved security of South Vietnam are good. The VNA, as its training progresses and as more units are released from static security duties, probably will be able to pacify and extend government authority into..many areas of present Communist influence. Diems -success in by-passing thc July 1956 election ' date without evoking large scale Communist i military reaction will reassure many Victna-I mese and encourage them to cooperate with , GVN programs to expose and root out Com-j munists. Continued improvement in internal security will depend in some measure on the governments ability to deal with economic and social problems and on the effectiveness 1 of the administrative apparatus. 70 If the Communists were to undertake larre scale guerrilla action in South Vietnam, they probably would not be able to develop widespread popular support, especially if the VNA were to register some early military suc- cess. The GVN is being increasingly accepted as a nationalist alternative to Communist t leadership. Public confidence in the GVN, combined with general war-weariness, may have already reached the point where any cnort to upset thc government by force Wpuld lead to a strong popular reaction against the guerrillas. 71. The trend toward increased political stability in South Vietnam will probably continue during the period of this estimate and President Diem will probably continue to exercise effective political control; The trend toward t authoritarian rule through thc political par tics led by Diems relatives and small circle of trusted associates will probably continue. Iso, lation and neutralization of government crit ics and men disliked or distrusted by Diem will also continue. Diem and his associates are likely to exert strong pressures against j any opposition in the Assembly. Thus it is ( not likely that Diem or his government wjll meet any serious opposition in the National Assembly during thc pcriod of this estimate; however, over a longer pcriod the accumulation of grievanccs among various groups and individuals may lead to development of a national opposition movement.! The major economic problems will undoubtedly continue and over thc longer run may handicap South Vietnam in competition with the Communist north, but economic conditions are unlikely to afIcct political stability during the pcriod of this estimate. 72. Despite the moderately favorable outlook projected for South Vietnam, the situation contains many elements of instability, and progress will continue to depend on firm US support. A number of contingent developments could create new tensions'among the foreign powers concerned as well as between the GVN and the DRV. For example, the steps which Diem is willing to take toward facilitating the operations of thc ICC may not bc adequate to satisfy India whose representa-tivc serves as chairman of the Commission. Should the Commission withdraw, DRV agitation might well bc intensified and international Communist pressures on the diplomatic level would probably increase. Thc UK might become less firm in its support of Diems position. Weakening of international support for Diem, a marked increase in Bloc support for the DRV, or a substantial increase in Communist activity within South V tnam would probably weaken the governments confidence in its position, cause soma loss of public support, and lead to renewed efforts by opponents of thc regime in the direction o; .econciliation with the north.

However, basic objectives and main directions of U. S. policy can and should bo established on a regional basis. 2. Consequences of Communist Domination. The; national security of thc United States would bcTndangorod by Communist domination of mainland Southeast Asia, whether achieved by overt aggression, subversion, or a political and econo-tic offensivea. The loss to Cotununist control of any single free country would encourage tendencies toward accommodation by thc rest. b. T.e loss of tho entire area would have a seriously adverse impact on the U.

At present OVort aggression and militant subversion are loss likely than an intensified campaign of Communist political, 6cono.mic and cultural penetration in the area, Tho political instability, economic backwardness, export problems, and oxtro.no nationalism of those countries provide many opportunities for Communist exploitation by trade and economic assistance, conventional, political and diplomatic activity, and uxtonsivo infiltration. This offensive now constitutes a throat to U. S. interests more subtle and more difficult to 1 cope with than other threats. <1 P 4. United Staten Role-. The United States is likcly to remain tho only major outside source of power to counteract tho Russian-Chin,.so Communist thrust intp Southeast Asia. Thus, the rotUntion of this area in tho free world will continue to depend on the extent and effectiveness of U. S. support as well as on the local efforts of tho countries themselves. i a. Political. Tae underlying purpose of U.

In part it will i require an intensification of present programs for training compotcnt Asian ltahagorial and technical i personnel.

Those should not con-cantrato exclusively at tho national level, but should include activities designed to stronthen and vitalize indigenous traditions and institutions and to havc an  i .react on Village life, rural society, and educational L . systems.

Tho combination of such U. S. forcos and local will to resist would constitute tho cost dotcrxont against aggression.

POLICY CONCLUSIONS 7. The national independence of the mainland Southeast Asian states is important to the security interests of the United States. If such independence is to be preserved, U. S. '' policies must seek to build sufficient strength in the area at least to identify aggression, suppress subVersion, prevent communist political and economic domination, and assist the non-Communist governments to consolidate their domestic positions. U. S. policy should not depend primarily on thc degree and nature of Communist activity at any particular time, but should seek to promote these goals within the limits of thc economic capacities of the countries concerned and U. S. resources available for the area. I  . 8. Where a national determination to maintain independ, ence and oppose external aggression is sufficiently manifest, j the United States should be prepared to provide military as- sistance based upon the missions of the forces as indicated . in the "Country Courses of Action" (Par,t V, below).  . 9. In the event of aggression aainSt a Southeast Asian  state willing to resist, the provisions of the UN Charter or t the SEATO Treaty should be invoked, but the 'United States should not forgo necessary action in behalf of such a state  or states because of tho possibility that other allies might I 'be loath to participate or to furnish more than token military forces. I . 10. In the long run, tho ability of the non-Communist i governments, to attain political, economic and social objectives will be thc dominant factor in defeating thc Communist attempts to dominate Southeast Asia. The United States should assist . < . ' thc non-Communist states of the area to formulate and cxcute ' programs designed to promote conditions of sound development, to demonstrate that they can achieve growth without reliance on. Communist methods or dependence on the Communist bloc, and ito giwe their.peoples a greater stake in the continued inde- pcndcncc of their countries. 11. The United States should continue- to make clear its own deVotion to the principle of collective security, its belief that regional security arrangements provide maximum pro-V tcction at minimum cost for all, and its expectation that a IC 8- NSC 56121    .     countrys decision to participate in such arrangements is based on its own calculation of its best interests and does not of itself constitute a claim for increased financial aid. Where countries participate, measures to assure adherence are desirable, normally including preferential treatment in the fields of economic and military assistance as justified by U. S. strategic objectives. Where new opportunities for affiliation develop they should be encouraged. The United States should, however, accept the right of each nation to choose its own path to the future, and should not exert pressure to make active allies of countries not so inclined. The genuine independence of such countries from Communism serves U. S. interests even though they are not formally aligned with the United States. The United States should accordingly support and assist them so long as they remain determined to preserve their own independence and are actively pursuing policies to this end. III. OBJECTIVE 12. To prevent the countries of Southeast Asia from passing into or becoming economically dependent upon the Communist bloc; to persuade them that their best interests lie in greater cooperation and stronger affiliations with the rest of the Free world; and to assist them to develop toward stable, free, representative governments with the will and ability to resist Communism from within and without, and thereby to contribute to the strengthening of the Free world.  IV. REGIONAL COURSES OF ACTION 13. Support and assist the countries of the area on the basis of their will and ability to defend and strengthen their independence. t 14. Respect each country's choice of national policy for preserving its independence, but make every effort to demonstrate the advantages of greater cooperation and closer alignment with the Free world, as well as the dangers of alignment with the Communist bloc. 15. Encourage the countries of Southeast Asia to cooperate closely with each other on a basis of mutual aid and support, and support indigenous efforts to develop regional associations so long as they do not weaken SEATO or the spirit of resistance to Communism.  The regional courses of action are not applicable to Malaya and Singapore1087 NSC 56131 .     .  16. Participate actively in SEATO, and seek to develop with its military and non-military aspects in a manner that will convincingly ' demonstrate the value of SEATO as a regional association, the usefulness of which extends b'eyond deterrence of Communist expansion. Encourage limited participation of non-Communist, non-SEATO Asian nations in certain SEATO activities. 17. Encourage and support the spirit of resistance among the peoples of Southeast Asia to Chinese Communist aggression as well as to indigenous Communist insurrection, subversion, and propaganda. 18. Maintain, in the general area of the Far East, U. S. forces adequate to exert a deterrent influence against Communist aggression, in conformity with NSC 56021. 19. Should overt Communist aggression occur in the Southeast Asian treaty area, invoke the UN Charter or the SEATO Treaty, or both as applicable; and subject to local request for assistance take necessary military and any other action to assist any Mainland Southeast Asian state or dependent territory in the SEATO area willing to resist Communist resort to force Provided, that the taking of military action shall be subject ' to prior submission to and approval by the Congress unless the emergency is deemed by the President to be so great that immediate action is necessary to save a vital interest of the United States. 20. In case of an imminent or actual Communist attempt to seize control from within, and assuming some manifest local desire for U. S. assistance, take all feasible measures to thwart the attempt, including even military action after appropriate Congressional action. 21. As appropriate, assist the police forces in Southeast Asian countries to obtain training and equipment to detect and contain Communist activities. 22. In rder to strengthen the non-Communist governments of the area and to help forestall their economic dependents on the Communist bloc a. Provide flexible economic and technical assistance as necessary to attain U. S. objectives. b. Encourage measures to improve the climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign, and to mobilize the maximum investment of U. S. private capital in the area consistent with the prevailing climate.  1088 NSC 56121       1. c. Encourage United Nations agencies, other Colombo Plan countries, and other friendly countries to contribute available resources to promote the economic growth of Southeast Asia. d. Encourage the Southeast Asian countries to orient their economics in the direction of the free world and to rely primarily on non-Communist markets and sources of supply for trade, technicians, capital development, and atomic development. e. In carrying out programs involving disposal of U. S. agricultural surpluses abroad (1) Give particular attention to the economic vulnerabilities of the Southeast Asian countries and avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, detracting from the ability of these countries to market their own exportable produce. (2) Give particular emphasis to the use of the resources to promote multilateral trade and economic development. f. Promote as appropriate the expansion of trade relationships between the United States and the countries of Southeast Asia. g. Take advantage of adverse local reactions to Communist barter agreements with countries in the area by demonstrating the advantages to these countries of conducting trade on a multilateral commercial basis. 23. Make a special, sustained effort to help educate an expanding number of technically competent, pro-Western civilian and military leaders, working bilaterally, through the United Nations, with the other Colombo Plan countries and with other friendly countries. Stress the development of potential and secondary leadership to support the thin stratum of elite now administering the central governments and bring to their support modern techniques and technology in public information and organi zation. 24.

Reference is made to ADMIN CINCPAC Message 040151Z July 1956, subject "Preliminary Summary of SEATO Third Military Staff Planners' Conference, Singapore, 11-27 June," which stated, inter alia, that CINCPAC would require high level policy guidance on the matter of U.S. force commitments to the SEATO. 2. The permanent SEATO Military Planning Staff is scheduled to be established in Bangkok by 15 January 1957- As force requirements planning progresses toward detailed plans, there will be increasing pressure placed on the United States, particularly by the Asian members of SEATO, for information as to availability of U.S. forces to support SEAT'D plans. 3. The United States should not.duplicate the pattern of NATO and its significant standing military forces by earmarking U. S. forces for Southeast Asia. Instead, the United States should maintain mobile striking power readily available for immediate operations and sufficient, in concept with other nations, to defeat overt Communist local aggression in the SEATO area. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that although detailed U.S. stra-tegic plans should not be discussed with military representatives of the SEATO nations, the United States should discuss her capa-bilities and methods of providing support to these nations without making a specific commitment of forces. The major effort of the United States should be to provide those types of forces which are needed in the SEATO area and logistic support to indigenous forces. 4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the United States make no specific force commitments to the SEATO but that the U. S. Military Adviser, at the next meeting of the SEATO Military 1096 .      advisors be authorized to reassure the SEATO nations of U.S. support in the event of overt Communist aggression. The Joint Chiefs of Staff further recommend that the U.S. Military Adviser be authorized to inform the SEATO nations, in broad terms, of the major U.S. forces deployed to the western Pacific and those forces available to CINCPAC for contingency planning, emphasizing the flexibility and mobility of these forces. For the Joint Chiefs of Staff sArthur Radford ARTHUR RADFORD, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff 1097       1957 .     April 15, 1957 In reply refer to 1-134757 Dear Mr. Robertson Recent developments have brought about a new urgency in re-solving the problem of the ceiling on U. S. military personnel in Viet-Nam. You will, remember that by interdepartmental agreement early in 1956 there was established a ceiling of 692, which in-cludes -342 for the MAAG and 350 for TERM, the Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission. Two facets of the problem now point to the necessity of doing away with the MAAG ceiling and permitting the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to augment MAAG Viet-Nam with the additional personnel necessary to accomplish the mission there. The first aspect is that raised in the telegram from the Embassy in Saigon to the Department of State, 2772, of 12 March 1957, which points out that the International Control Commission is becoming increasingly more restive in respect to TERM and recommends consideration of several courses of action. The Depart-ment of Defense concurred in the April 9 Department of State tele-gram to Saigon which stated that a solution of the problem along the lines of incorporating TERM into an increased MAAG was under study and that the Department of State would discuss the problem with the Canadians, British, French, and Indians. This telegram was the result of a conference on March 20 of sta.ff representatives of the two departments in which Ambassador Durbrow participated. The second aspect of the problem is the necessity for taking over the training of the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force. It will be remembered that TERM was created for a dual purpose, to provide a logistical organization to resolve the problems of excess pro-perty in Indochina and logistical training in Viet-Nam, and to free the MAAG from other duties so that its personnel could concentrate on the training of the Vietnamese Army. The withdrawal of the French Army training personnel required this increased emphasis on training. In the telegram from Chief, MAAG Viet-Nam 5607 of 4 April, we have been informed that President Ngo Dinh Diem told the Chief, MAAG that agreement had been reached with the French Ambassador for the withdrawal of the French Air Force and Navy training missions upon the completion of the present courses of instruction. The first completion is scheduled for this month, and additional U.S. military personnel will be required to pick 1098 .     up the training from the French. CINCPAC has requested in his O62352Z of 6 April that additional personnel over and above the present ceiling reach Viet-Nam in June of this year. Other aspects of the problem of the ceiling include a request from President Diem for additional Army instructors at the Viet-Nam military academy, a proposal by CINCPAC to transfer underway training of the Vietnamese Navy from Subic Bay to VietNam, and the current difficulty in operating MAAG and TERM efficiently within their present ceilings. An increase in MAAG strength to achieve a rapid improvement in the effectiveness of Vietnamese forces to compensate for the withdrawal of French forces is considered a matter of urgency, while the French have withdrawn approximately 190,000 regular troops from Viet-Nam since the Geneva Agreement was signed the Viet Minh have continuously reorganized and re-equipped their forces during the same period so as to increase their regular combat strength from six to eighteen divisions. These forces have a capability of conducting combat operations at Corps level. The Vietnamese Army consists of ten divisions which are in the early stages of training at regimental and division level. The current military situation requires that the Vietnamese armed forces expeditiously attain a satisfactory level of combat effectiveness. In view of the forthcoming visit of President Diem to washington on May 8th, 9th, and 10th and of the impending training crises for the Vietnamese Navy and Air Force I recommend that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to secure the necessary international concurrences in the abolition of the ceiling on MAAG Viet-Nam. I feel it might be desirable to have this problem resolved, if possible, prior to the arrival of President Diem in Washington so that he could be informed at that time of our plans to assist him in the training of his Navy and Air Force.

' ' 3, Burma appears to be moving closer to the Free World. Although her basic policy of neutralism is unlikely to change, Burma has indicated interest in obtaining U.S. economic and military assistance. The U.S. has been unable to influence ' . Cambodia in thc direction.of development of a stable government and non-involvement . with tho Communist Bloc. The situation in Laos Worsened, tho government being . threatened with the possibility of downfall if negotiations with thc Pathot Lao should collapse. The Federation of Malaya made further progress in its transition to independence. Thailand rs slow progress toward free representative government continued, and Vietnam seems clearly persuaded that its interests lie in stronger. affiliation with, the Free World.'  . 4. A combined SEATO military exercise was held to improve military coopera-  tion.among the SEATO nations. Prospects that other nations might participate in . SEATO did not improve, with the exception of Vietnam. On the whole, MDAP has begun ' to make a contribution. In Vietnam tho Army is how capable of insuring internal security, and in Cambodia the MAAG has made some progress toward achieving a working relationship with ths Cambodian general staff. In Laos DAP has made an army pos- Bible. In Thailand the armed forces are considered capable of meeting any indigenous threat to internal security, retarding external aggression, and making a token contribution to collective defense. ' . j A' 5. The economic aid programs in the area havc all continued to show slow ' '. progress. No new U.S. commitments havc been entered into during the reporting period. Efforts Five been made to lessen demands upon U.S. resources and upon local . economies (NSC Action No. 1599-0). In Caiabcdia and Laos the armed forces were re-, duced, and in Vietnam the U.S, has refused a request for an increase of forces.

InR Tt SMCFTARY 0? DeHim;       THE PROSPECTS FOR- NORTH VIETNAM THE PROBLEM TO analyze the current political, economic, and military situations and to esti-mate the prospects for North Vietnam over the next year or so. .. CONCLUSIONS 1. Although the Communist regime in North Vietnam (DRV) has probably lost a considerable measure of its original popular support and has been faced with sporadic outbursts of violence, it remains in firm control largely because Of the loy-alty and effectiveness of the army. Moreover, with substantial help from the Bloc, it has apparently macle significant prog-ress toward economic restoration, particularly in agriculture. (Paras. 13-16, 20-21) 2. The DRV has undertaken to cor-rect its nuistakes which it admits caused popular resentment, and it will probably be able to regain some Of the popular sup-pert which it lost. If the party Organization is sufficiently strengthened and if crop prospects are good, stops toward further socialization of agriculture may come as scon as the fall or winter of 1957, Local disturbances may recur but for the foreseeable future the DRV will be ca-pable of maintaining effective control. (Paras. 17, 23-26) 3. The DRV is generally isolated from the outside world except for close ties with the Bloc, on which it depends for aid and support. However, the DRV has probably been disappointed by the lack of effective Blcc support for its objective of unifying all Vietnam under DRV rule. The DRV, with Bloc logistical support, could easily overrun South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos if opposed only by indigenous forces. However, the Bloc wOuld support such an attack only if Moscow and Peiping were to estimate that, such action carried little risk of US military interVention. (Paras. 29-34) 4. The DRV will probably cOnfinue its tactics of peaceful competition with South Vietnam for the support of the Vi-etnamesc, although it will continue its ef-forts to infiltrate and to subv it Official and nonofUcial organizations ..net to ex-ploit dissident and dissatisfied groups in South Vietnam. In Laos, we believe that the DRV will continue to supp rt Pathet Lao efforts to negotiate a political agreement with the Royal Lao Government, with the ultimate objective of Communist control, and may encourage local Pathet Lao military action in order to bring pressure to this end. The DRV will probably not, in the immediate future, play a pri-mary role in Cambodia. (Paras. 34-36) SECRET lit 2 .

Secretary Quarles opened thc meeting by explaining that, instead of a briefing for President Ngo as had originally . been scheduled, it was felt that this night bc considered presumptuous in view of the President1s knowledge of Southeast Asia, ar.d therefore the President was invited to express his viewson he sitnation, . President Ngo proceeded to sketch out his thoughts on the strategic problem of Vi ct-rlar.i, thc military situation and its requirements. Hc views Vi e t-Nm.I as a bridgehead, which . jn case of conflict would receive support and assistancc from SEATO. Viet-Nam is endangered by two things; subversive elements under Communist direction and aggression by invasion. This latter may take thc form of invasion at the 17th parallel,or over thc- high plateau and then down through Laos to cut off the capital from the west, or a combination of both. The invasion route across the lth parallel would ctt off a )arye-. per con tagc of thc population and not enough would be left tu' raise additional forces for rcsistance. Thc int erior 1i nc .  .    By NWD Dale 2011 SECREI of invasion along thc border arca has no natural defenses after the enemy passes through the Annam Chain. This is a soft area for defensive purposes. Either one, or a combination of both, of the above routes is possiblc and feasible. Above the 17th parallel the Viet Minh havc 200,000 regular troops and 250,000 regional troops. Secretary Quarles raised the question as to restriction on those forces by the Gcncva Accords. It- was -stated that.there is no restriction on the numbers. The troops, however, have becn given modernized equipment and training by thc Chinese Communists and their re-equipment is a violation of thc Geneva Accords. Prcsidcnt Kgo also st at cd the Russians arc particularly concerned with the training of these forces and in accordance with Russian practice havc emphasized artillery to thc point that they have three times as much as Viet-Nam. He stated that the . Viet-Minh air force has been training in Communist China since 1951. The Vietnamese do not havc sufficient forces to guard the entire border. Laos has a weak army, very poor roads and is lightly populated. Infiltration through Laos is both easy and dangerous to Viet-Nam. It is believed possible.that the Viet Minh could infiltrate this interior route with as many as a .100.000 troops disguised as coojics which could bc very dangerous. President Ngo Views a strictly defensive plan as unsatisfactory if only because of thc demoralizing factor. 11c feels the plan must bc both offensive and defensive. He covered this concept as follows (1) Vietnamese do not know thc SEATO Plan. (2) The General Staff first conceived a defensive plan which was considered demoralizing. (3) They have now conceived an offensive-defensive plan which has been referred to Genera) Williams. (4) Population of thc North is against Commonism. lf free to move it would move out to the South. In the North soldiers are the principals in the priviledged class. (5) lt is believed necessary in the event of aggression to .bring airborne troops into the high plateau arca of Laos-Viet-Nam, and also conduct airborne opcrations to pin down thc Viet Minh and make possible an offensive to thc North, In addition the line of the 17th . parallcl must bc hold as this is thc rente ofrefugees. Any airbornc landings must bc Vietnamese troops not foreign troops. I'oreign troops should bo limited to use bclow the l7th parallel as support forces. Big question for Vietnamese is when do they get the foreign troops. Thai forces will be otherwise occupied. Thc civil guard is poorly equipped and would not be effective. There are no other 'ground forces available in thc Southeast 11UI      Asia area. In answer to a .question as to whcthcr thc troops to he used in thc plat cat-could bc Thai, the President answered ro. Laos is afraid of thc Thais; they are afraid of a Pan-Thai movement to swallow Laos. Laos"hates Cambodia, distrusts the Thais but likes the Vie tn arte sc. They would like an out. 1 ct to the sea at Tourane. They have promised to scnd officers to bc trained bythe Vietnamese. President Ngo then commented on his planned second counter move which is to fill up thc vacuum of the high plateau area, the forest border area and the Plaine dcs Jones. This plan will bc begun by placing trained demobilized men from thc Civil Guard in these areas with their .families, 3,000 so far. llc is not; 'appeal i ng to thc peoplc of the central Viet-Nam area to settle on the high plateau and is askint! people of South Viet-Nam, thc southern areas, to move into' the Plaine desJoncs. SEATO has always recognized thc need of thc fight against subversion. Planting men in these areas will construct, a human wall effective against. Corimunist infiltration and subversion. The above goes hand in hand with construction of roads in thc above areas. Stationing men and building roads serve both a strategic and economic purpose. Thc road building projects is really a stage of thc French plan that goes .back to 1919 and continues to 1942. Secretary Quarles asked the status of thc road construction nor. The President answered it had not yet begun but Capital Engineering Firm was starting constructionstudics and he thought construction could begin next year. These roads in the interior are important because the roads along thc coast is easily disrupted. It has many bridges and that is why French, thinking of the possibility of Japanese aggression along the coast, thought roads in this arca desirable. This vra's part of the French Empire Plan to tie together Viet-Nam Cambodia and Laos. lt is still a good plan for the defense of Southeast Asia. It includes a road across the interior to Paksc on the tiekong which is near thc Thai Railroad terminus at Ubon. Route 9 from Tourane to Savannakhet is too closc to the 17th parallel, but Laos is interested in an outlet to the sca for economic reasons. SEATO principals are (1) to pary aggression (2) struggle against subversion and (3) economic and social aspects required to support thc above. Thc French and British arc interested mostly in number 3. The military strategic aspect of offcasive-defonsiyc plan arc favored by the air force and navy. In case of aggression tactical atonic v weapons could bc used. Vietnamese fccl they must craphasizc ground vroapotts because the Viet-Ilan war showed that it was difficult to use air effectively in this country. Communist      troops arc idy mobile. Tije irregular forces advemee ahcud ox regular troops to sanotagc and cut communications. They also follow the regular troops .to subdue thc population. Use of atomic weapons against, the aggression through thc sparcc settled tciritoiy of Lacs would not be effective. Therefore, the President noli eves that the Vietnamese must reorganize their Army tpbe prepared for such a struanJe. Despite thc exports of General. ODaniel thc present Army structure is now not satisfactory. This is due to the French V policy which insisted on keepinn Vietnamese forces, in small units no laigei tmin a battalion, preventing the development of a popei Uet-Ldn Amy. This is vhy Diem could not. come to power sooner. French said Vietnamese couldnt be trained and uere too weak physically. They limited them to light forces. After tho Armistice the French continued to control the xOiccs. Following the French phase out,, and thc elimination 0 1 Fl on ch ioices, training was con duct cd under a mixed French-US training group. The French concept of light battalion, light division, heavy division, made no sense at all not even for use against the sects. I therefore felt the Army should be completely reorganizod?and consolidation of training into a strictly US mission made this possible. The U.S. military .know that the Vietnamese make good soldiers. I have talked over my idea with General Williams, and it is to reorganize my 6 light and 4 heavy divisions of 5,600 and 8,300 men respectively, lnto the sane number of field divisions with 10,000 eacn, vzith 3 regiments per division. To achieve this thc Array must increase to 170,000. This would avoid a complete shift of the present division. If we stay at the present 150,000 men it would be necessary to shift or change the basic structure. If our total forces are raised to 170 thousand wc could increase each division to 10,000. To reduce the impact o;t the budget I have decreed a draft as a stop gap P-n lU-aftccs win be inducted for 1 year terms in the age'group 20 to 21 Beginning 1 August 150 per day will be ted. This will amount to dS,000 per year. In 3 yca-rs this will make it possible to replace 23 of the Army at the end of 3.years. the budget will be stabilized. At the present time 1 e 4 1.am a my is o-rgamzed along French colonial lines with the xamilies traveling with the troops. The average pay is a thousand piasters a month. The military budget is 170 million dollars a year. ihe use of draftees would reduce thc cost by half. Draftees would be young people with no families; The US. military recommend that I not replace all my troops with ara.tecs but rctam 30,000 minimum as a hard core. I believe the above is necessary because in my view to meet agemossion in ny country requires emphasis on thc ground forces. As thc ll.GG      . present troops with their families are demobilized they would be settled in the high plateau and tho Plaine des Jones, area. Tins would be beneficial both from economic and strategic reasons. ,  ,At this point Secretary Quarles noted that the President was due at the Fh Club shortly rc tcd tiHe f<. a , ''TlnR1. ''R.rost uas whether Ihe Gcncva Accords Innjb.tect (US) tramins personnel. Prcsidct Dicu rc.iied that there had been no proteststhere had been embarrassing questions, but too Geneva Accords only prohibited troop rein-forcementsMr. Quarles asked a general question on the status of training and equipment of the Viet-Nam air force. General Don replied tnat the planes turned over by the French had bccn retained for training until no longer usable and then returned. Ilesiclent 1..0 Sdia that in general vehicles and communications equlpLiCiit were in bad shape. Those can be replaced with the same type used by tne French without violating the Geneva Accorus.. He continued to say that the Frenchtraining of the air force and navy in his opinion was very pOor because thc Frencn were dragging then feet.

BACKGROUND ' U.S. Policy in Mainland Southoast Asia was approved on 5 September 1956. This progress report covers the pcriod 13 March through 6 November 1957. SUMMARY 2. Genoral. Many surface developments seemed to favor the Free World, although the Communists, often working underground, may have made gains of their own.. The coup in Thailand, the repercussions of which are still to be felt over-shadowed all other developments. If Thailand orients itself toward neutralism, some of the Free world gains might well.be reduced. The SEATO staff was strengthened, and the September Military Advisers' meeting was highly successful.. There was modest progress in developing SEATO economic and social programs. Nevertheless, the generation of public attitudes favorable to collective security pacts and the Vfest in general is becoming increasingly difficult in the area. The adverse effect on U.S. political objectives of PL 480 rico sales temporarily recedcd because the area nations found ready markets for their produce in 1957. ' .  I Political items of interest on specific countries are a. Tha5land The dependability of assurances that Thai'foreign policy will not change remains to be seen. A period of considerable domcstic instability'is anticipated. Adjustments ' to Communist Chintl will probably continue. Owing to tho ; changed situation, various U.S. programs-, particularly military and economic assistance programs, are being reviewed. r b. Burma cautiously'developed closer relations with the Free ' world while maintaining publicly .its neutral position and .' continuing to receive Communist aid. Awareness of the Com-.munist danger increased. The Government recognized and p began to cope with its foremost problcm, thc preservation of law and order. c. Laos; Although the outlook improved with the formation c ' a conservative cabinet, negotiations for a cabinet including Pathet Lao (Communist-led) representatives became more ac- tive. The threat posed by Pathet Lao control of two northern provinccs continues, and security conditions in the areas under government control deteriorated. d. Cambodia A sharper awareness of the Communist danger appeared to creatc a more friendly climate toward thc U.S., and thc government showed an increased will to resist internal Communist subversion. Nevertheless, the overall internal security situation deterioratcd as a result of more vigorous Communist activity.      A . ' D SECET q  .

The government is opposed E to ariy political fusion with Singapore at this time. ' ' ' j i i . g. The Singapore government, although beset with internal .I political difficulties, weakened the Communists by ad- ; ; ditional arrests of known subversives.. ,. Economic. Serious obstacles to regional economic cooperation remain, ; such as preoccupation with domestic affairs, political antagonisms, and lack of complementary economies. Economic development throughout the area is . severely handicapped by lack of trained manpower. The Sino-Soviet Rloc cori- "tinucs a high degree, of economic activity in the area, with demonstrated . .flexibility. (Annex B is a discussion of Bloc-Southeast Asian economic cela- tions.) Southeast Asian nations are comparing U.S. and Sino-Soviet Bloc aid ; programs as to aid levels, administrative procedures and controls, and speed of C ' performance. Complaints continue regarding U.S. aid program delays. Con- ( . flicting claims on U.S. aid and inefficient use of local resources present , problems in some countries. The climate for U.S. private investment leaves much to be desired. Planned expenditures for U.S. economic and technical assistance for FY 1953 in millions are Burma$10.0; Thailand- $35.0; Cambodia$35.0; Laos$36.6; Vietnam$209.4; Malaya -none.

POLICY IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA . .GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS General,. Since mainland Southeast Asia does not represent a unified area, courses of action must generally be determined in the light of widely Varying country situations. HoweVer, basic objectiVes and main directions of U. S. policy can -nd should be established on a regional basis. ' 2. Consequences of Communist Domination. The national security of the United States would be endangered by Communist. domination of mainland Southeast Asia, whether achieVed by OVert aggression, subVersion, or a political and economic offensive, . t a. The loss to Communist control of any single free ' country would encourage tendencies toward accommodation z by the rest. b. The loss of the entire area would hare a seriously adVerse impact on the U. S. position elsewhere in the Far East, have severe economic consequences for many nations of the Free World, add significant resources to the Communist bloc in rice, rubber, tin and other minerals, and could result inseVere 'economic and political pressures on Japan and India for accommodation to -the Communist bloc. The loss of Southeast Asia mainland could thus , have farreaching consequences seriously adVerse to U. S. security interestsx ' 3. The Communist Threat a. Orert a sion. Although Communist policy now emphasizes non-military me.thods, the danger of OVert ag- gressicn will remain inherent so long as Communist China and North Viet Nam continue a basically hostile policy supported by substantial military forces. There 13 only For purposes of Nhis paper, "Mainland Southeast Asia" consists of Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaya and Singapore. In addition, there is attached a supple-menty statement of policy on the special situation in North Viet Nam. iiJ.5 NSC 5SO9 .     t p sentence to read as fol 10 "At present overt aggression and, except in the cases of Viet Nam and Laos, militant subVersion are les likely than an intensified campaign of Communist political, economic and. cultural penetration in the area,"      j.ur oiiVAjx a cease-fire in Viet Nam and sporadic hostilities continue in Laos.

SedWOlS.-PU. tn most countries of Southeast Asia 2. threat also ariuea from the exlotoneo or cxtonnivw local Communist capabilities for all types of subversive actiVities, ranging up to armed-insurrection. Additionally, the large OVerseas Chinese communities in-Southeast Asia offer a fertile field for subversion. The weak internal security systems of the Southeast Asian  states make them highly Vulnerable to such actiVities.  Coramunist Political and Economic 0ffensiVe. At present OVert. aggression and militant subVersion are less likely than ,an itensified campaign of Communist political, economic and cultural penetration in the area. The poli tical instability., economic .backwardness, export problems, and extreme nationalism of these countries proVide many opportunities for Communist exploitation by trade end economic assistance, conventional political and diplomatic activity, and extensiVe infiltration. This offensive now constitutes a. threat to U. S. interests more subtle and more difficult to cope with than other threats. 4. 8. Foley The United States is likely to remain the only major outside source of power to counteract the Russian- Chinese Communist thrust into Southeast Asia. Thus, the retention of this area in the Free World will continue to depend on the extent and effectiveness of U. S. support as . well Cs on the local efforts of the countries themselVes. a.. Political. The underlying purpose of U. S. assistance in the area is to help the non-Communist countries deVelop more effectiVe political organizations, . strengthen their internal administration and enlist . great- allegiance in both urban and rural districts, ln part, this purpose will be serued by programs for military and economic aid dealt with below. In part it will require an intensification of present programs for " training competent Asian managerial and technical personnel. And, in part, new approaches, both goVern- rrontal and priVate, trill be needed. These should not. concentrate exclusively at the national level, but should include actiVities designed to strengthen and vitalize indigenous traditions and institutions and to haVe an impact on village life, rural society, and educational systems1117 ' . TOP SECR3T .      he Military. Because these countries do not have . the capability of creating armed forces which could ' effectively resist large-scale external aggression, the United States will be required to provide a basic shield against Communist aggression.' For the foreseeable future, local will to resist aggression will depend on a. conviction in Southeast Asia that the United States will con. tinue- its support and will- maintain striking forces . adequate to counter aggression in Southeast Asia v;ith the .capabilities described in current basic national security policy. The combination of such U. S. forces and local . will to resist would constitute the best deterrent against aggression. Should the deterrent fail, this combination would also provide the most effectiVe insurance tht, in conjunction with indigenous and allied ... forces, the United States could, suppress aggression in the area, quickly and in a manner and on a. scale best  calculated to auoid the hostilities broadening into ceneral war. c. Economic and Technical. The insistence, throughout most of the area, on economic dcVelopment proVides . the strongest leVer for the exertion of influence by the z- . Free World or by the Communist bloc. Without increased . external help from some source, most oi' the goVernments of the area will be unable, eVen with adequate indigenous effort, to manage the political demand for rapid better-, ment in' the conditions of life and provide for sound economic deVelopment, Failure to obtain such assistance from the Free World will tend to driVe these countries toward economic dependence on thc .Communist bloc. The general preference in Southeast Asia for Western technical and economic assistance gives the United States and the Free World an opportunity to obtain primacy oyer Communist efforts in key economic sectors. The outcome may, howerer, be strongly influenced by the success with which . the Free World can cope With Communist efforts 11 exploit the existence of Southeast Asian export problems, particularly those involving rice. In the period ahead, flexibility of U. S. procedure and rapidity of U. Saction will, be increasingly important, if effect Ve a chant age is to be taken of unexpected and transient opportunities, .. 5 The Problem of Regional Association. Ovey the long rm, the small, vulnerable, and essentially dependent nations of Southeast Asia, cannot exist satisfactorily as free nations Without closer associations than now exist. 111P . NSC 5809 . Top S CRET      '   6. The Problem of Alignment. Tp preserVe their indepen- dence,'lengthen their internal stability and protect themselves against aggression, some countries in Southeast Asia prefer to join regional security arrangements. Some, howeVer, prefer to droid alignment with other nations. The basic objective of both groups is to maintain the independence of .their countries free of outside interference or dictation, and the independence and vitality of both are important to the United States and to each other.  ", ' '  IX. POLTCY CONCLUSIONS . 7. The national independence of the mainland Southeast .Asian states is important to the security interests of the ' United.States. If such independence is to be preserVed, UMS. nolicies must seek to build sufficient strength in the area, at ' least tojidentify aggression, suppress subVorsion, preVent Communist political and economic domination, and assist the non-Ccmmunist governments to consolidate their domestic positions. U. S. policy should not depend primarily on the degree . and nature of Communist actiVity at any particular time, but . should seek to promote these goals within the limits of the . economic capacities of the countries concerned and U. S. f z resources available for the area8. Where a national determination to maintain independence and oppose external aggression is sufficiently manifest, the United States should be prepared to proVide military assistance based upon the missions of the forces as indicated in the Country Courses of Action" (Part V, below).  .   . 9. In the eVent of aggression against a. Southeast Asian state Willing to resist, the proVisions of the UN Charter or the SE''TO Treaty should be inuoked, but the United States ... ... 5hovii not forgo necessary action in behalf of such a state . or states because of the possibility that other allies might be loath to participate or to furnish more than token military forces. > 10. In the long run, the ability of the non-Communist c-oVernments to attain 'political, economic and social objectives will be the dominant factor in defeating the Communist attempts . to dominate Southeast Asia. The United States should assist the non-Communist states of the area to formulate and execute programs designed to promote conditions of sound development, to demonstrate that they can achieve growth tvithout reliance on Communist methods or dependence on the Communist bloc, and to eive their peoples a greater stake in the continued independence of their countries. NSC 5809  ' " ' .      11. The United States should continue to make clear its own devotion.to the principle of collective security, its belief that regional sepurity arrangements proVide maximum protection at minimum- cost for all, and its expectation that a countrys decision to participate in such arrangements is based on its own calculation of its best interests and does not of itself constitute a claim for increased financial aid. Where countries participate, measures to assure adherence are desirable, normally including preferential treatment in the fields' ofeconomic and military assistance as justified by U. S. strategic objectives. Where new opportunities for affiliation deVolop they -Should be encouraged. The United States should, however, accept the right of each nation to choose its own path to the- future, and should not exert pressure to make actiVe allies of countries not so inclined. The genuine independence of such countries from Communism, serves U. S. interests even though they are not formally .aligned with the United States. The United States should accordingly support and assist them so long as they remain determined to preserVe their own independence and are actiVely pursuing policies to this endIII. OBJECTIVES . z 12. To preVent the countries of Southeast Asia from passing into or becoming economically dependent upon the Communist bloc; to persuade them that their best interests lie in greater cooperation and stronger affiliations with the rest of the Free World; and to assist them to deVelop toward stable, free, representative goVernments with the will and ability to resist Communist from within and without, and thereby to contribute to thestrengthening of the-Free World.

I. REGIONAL SUMMARY EVALUATION r 1. General. Burma and Cambodia showed a more friendly atti- tude toward the United States and thc Free World, and Cambodian leaders made some attempt to control communist subversion. Thailands new regime rerinvigorated the pro-SEATO, anti-communist policies of its predecessors, and Viet-Nam maintained close relationship with Hie United StatesOn the other hand, as the price for. regaining control of thc two provinces previously dominated by thc Pathet Lao, thc Lao Govern- f ment acccpted two Pathct Lao leaders in the National Cabinet and assimilated some Pathct Lao troops into the Royal Lao Army. The conservative governing coalition in newly-independ ent-Malaya suffered some political  setbacks. The communist-supported leftist party did very well in Singa-  porc municipal elections in contrast to thc poor showing of moderate and conservative political partiest The short-run economic outlook in Southeast Asia is somewha clouded by declining foreign exchange reserves and prospects for lower export earnings resulting from poorer rice crops and lower prices for other export commodities. In the long-run better prospects exist, as- j cuming favorable political clcvelopments, because of (a) the wealth of human, agricultural and raw materials resources of tho area and (b) . thc developing power, communications, irrigation and other basic facili- ties supported by external financial assistance. 2. SEATO. Satisfactory progress continued at the operational 1 level in military and civil aspects; however, the Asian members still seek an expansion of economic activities. Atomic-capable weapons were SECRET      SECRET successfully introduced without adverse psychological reaction in thc re- b cent "Phiblink" cxercise, and a number of military exercises have been sChcduled and approved for the coming year. Standardization of equipment is being accomplished between military forces of member nations which will lead to a reduotion of thc technical obstacles to fuller cooperation in mutual defense. There were .significant administrative improvements; political Consultation in meetings of thc Council Representatives.improved in quality and content; and.a successful counter-subversion seminar was hold in Baguio; and a cultural round table, attended by some non-member govcrn-rncnts,. vas held in Bangkok. In addition, the United States has committed $2 million for skilled labor training and agreed in principle to assist . ' Thailand in the SEATO context to develop university engineering facilities. '. What is generally Considered to have bccn the most successful Council niecting to date was held in Manila in March. Among other things, the Council at that time authorized the Secretary- General to enter into lirriitc'd contact with other regional defense organizations and agreed to a proposal that contact with non-member states be continued and expanded in thc coming year. ' 3. Mekong River Development The four-power Coordinating Com- mittee established by Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vict-Nam to plan thc development of the Mekong River basin agreed to set up a system for the cooperative collection of basic data on thc river basin. In line with our regional objectives the U. S. offered at the time of the recent ECAFE mceting at Kuala Lumpur to contribute a total of AZ million to establishment of this system. Thc offer, which was acCepted by the four riparian countries, produced a favorable impact in the ECAFE arca. The U. S. edn-tributionf- together with funds offered by the UN and other friendly governments, is sufficient to finance the costs for approximately the first year of the. development plan--$2. 5 million-recommended by the Wheclcr survey mission.

Obstacles to Regional Cooperation.At present more factors obstruct the development of regional cooperation in Asia than facilitate it. The most important ones arc nationalistic preoccupation with domestic SECRET .     SECRET affairs, political antagonisms and suspicions, and the general lack of comnlementary economiesf." While four riparian states are now agreed on the collcction of basic data regarding thc Lower Mekong River Basin, difficulties will probably arise if the time cornea to determine means of developing and utilizing power, irrigation, and navigation facilities. The Regional TelecommuhiCations Project has fallen far behind schedule chiefly bccause of problems with thc engineering contractor. A top-level advisor has completed an evaluation of the funda mental plan of the contractor in an attempt to expedite the project. 6. Slow EconomiC Development. Economic development in the area is slow because of a shortage of both public and private capital, and limited basic facilities such as power, communications, and transporta- . tion, as well as the limited number of trained, skilled personnel. Thc resistance of many Southeast Asia countries to measures which might encourage or assist overseas Chinese and other minority groups, also retards economic and business development. The'fall of prices for thc . basic export commodities of the area, with resultant government revenue . losses, may slow economic developmentIt has been difficult to find appropriate nieans of encouraging Free World industrial countries to contribute to the economic developmentof Southeast Asia. In the case, of Japan, at present Asias only important industrial country, it is difficult to determine the extent to which thc U.S. should encourage Japanese economic development activity in Southeast Asia. While Japancse proposals of Iunc 1957 for Asian regional financial institutions, to be funded largely by the U.S. and joined by other non-regional participants, were not found practicable by the U.S., the U.S. continues to recognize the desirability of close economic ties between Japan and Southeast Asia, and has offered to cooperate with Japan and interested Southeast Asia countries on a. case-by-case basis. 7, Public Attitudes. Efforts to encourage favorable public  attitudes in the arca toward collective security pacts and toward thc U.S, and thc Free World in general continue to face important obstacles, including fl) demonstrated growth of Sino-Soviet scientific, military, and economic power; (?.) Asian fear of involvement in nuclear warfare;  (3) thc appeal of communist coexistence propaganda; (4) increasing public interest in dojncatic, economic, financial and social problems; (5) doubt that participating in collective defense measures offers more benefits and less disadvantages than neutrality; and(6) national sensitivity which SECRET .

SEATO has a continuing problem in popularising the organization within Asian member countries as well as in thc general treaty area. It is essential that this problem bc solved if the leaders of Asian member countries are to succeed in countering domestic criticism . ' of SEATO membership; and if SEATO is to attract new members (notably Malaya). From the position taken by representatives of the Asian members in various SEATO forums, it is clcar that they consider membership in SEATO should enable them to obtain preferential treatment in the allocation of economic assistance,   f 9. Sing-Soviet Bloc Economic and Psychological Inroads. A com" bination of fairly widespread acceptance of communist coexistence propaganda, a desire to profit from communist "largess and conviction that communist infiltration is controllable, facilitates communist efforts to promote acceptance of their economic aid programs. In addition, although bloc aid has boonmeranged psychologically in certain instances, notably in Burma and less so in Cambodia, the resistance to bloc aid.is reduced by its reputation for "speed", "easy terms" and the apparent . ( absence of strings". In some instances, U.S. assistance, because of premature commitments or assurances of aid on thc ona hand and subse-qucnt delays, apparent inflexibility and Conspicuous chocks and control procedures on tho other, suffers by comparison in these respects. The high political imp ct of communist aid projects emphasizes the importance of continuing efforts to maximize tho effectiveness of U.S. aid programs< While Burma and Cambodia continue to be the chief bene.

The number of Soviet technicians in Burma is soon expected to increase greatly. Communist Chinas assistance to Burma was extended . in thc form of an agreement with Burma for a $4. 2 million loan.

Thailand has not yet accepted a Soviet offer of a "cobalt bomb" for hospital use. ' , 10. Economic Aid Program Delays. Much political and psychologi- cal credit as well as operational economy and efficiency continue to be lost .  bccause of premature commitments and assurances of aid on thc one hand and the inordinate'Nme required for formulation and implementation of our economic and technical assistance programs bn the other. Recipient 1 countries continue to complain of delays. This raises serious problems 1 with respect not only to thc assistance programs, but to U.S. relations in thc area. In addition, particularly in uncommitted countries, it . j . also materially reduced thc attractiveness of U.S. aid as compared with  c.ommiulict bloc aid. Commitments for physical construction arc frequently made bcfore reconnaisauce, engineering and cost estimates are available. In view of the impact of premature commitments and assur- ances of aid, and aid program delays on U.S. relations in thc arca and . on thc ability of thc U.S. to meet the economic challenge of the communist .bloc, increased emphasis will bc given to a conccntratcd, coordinated attack to eliminate these difficulties.

As a result of suatained efforts of thc conimunist bloc to con- ! eolidate advantages it gained in Cambodia in 1956, the internal security j . situation has .clearly deteriorated. However, there has been evidence rc- ccntly that Prince Sihanouk and other Cambodian leaders arc increasingly . aware of the potential dangers of communist activities, and come steps  havc been taken to control subversion. In the short run, tho situation in j.. Cambodia is not alarming, since the population as a whole remains  . strongly Buddhist, loyal to the monarchy and united under thc leadership of Prince Sihanouk, and it has- not yet bccn heavily subjected to communist influence. In thc long run, there is greater danger that the extension of . communist influence may overcome such counter measures as the Cam- j bodians.-rtay be prepared and able to take.  There has been a reduction in pro-communist sentiment within the Chinen community in Cambodia, largely because of the Cambodian ' Government action in the internal security field.

Cambodias neutrality inhibits it from taking a strong .stand in favor of tile Free World, and together with the long-standing animosity between Cambodia and its neighbors, prevents close associa .tion with them in regional organizations. .b. Cambodian neutrality also limits the opportunities for the United States to work closely with the Cambodian Government. It is . difficult to take measures to encourage Cambodia to meet the clangors of internal communist subversion without at thc same time seeming to  contravene Cambodian neutrality. We should encourage the Cambodians N ' . to. orient their policy in a direction more favorable to the West but any . evidcncc of undue pressure on our part to change the basic policy of neutrality could easily cause Cambodia to abandon its.new firmer posture , toward communism, , 21. Internal Security. In spite of increasing awareness of the ' magnitude of the communist effort in Cambodia, Cambodian leaders havc  .< taken far too few steps to counteract such influence. Implementation of thc police training program has progressed satisfactorily, but unification of all Cambodian police services has yet to take place and implementation of an agreed action program is hampered by administrative ineffectiveness. '  . 22. Developments Relating to Operating Problems. It is possible that the Cambodian developments of thc past few weeks, which indicate a  new awareness of the Communist threat and a determination to oppose it, may require that consideration bc give u to revision of certain paragra Ns in RSC 5U09 relating to Cambodia. In particular, paragraph 39, implying a continuing drift toward pro-communist neutrality, and paragraph 41, . implying that Cambodia might cease to demonstrate a will to resist internal communist subversion, may need to be replaced by paragraphs calling ' for U.S. action to promote inoreased awareness ofthe danger of subver- aion and to provide means to combat that danger, as well as U.S. econom- io aid in which continued stress should be put upon specific technical assistance, 23. Governmcnt Administration Weaknesses. One of Cambodias . most urgent needs is for effective civil administration. The ICA program is attempting to strengthen the most important public services education, agriculture, health and transportation.

' ' operate as a legal political party throughout the country wore generally  . considered a setback for U.S. objectives. On the positive side the Royal ; Lao Government has gained substantial control of Sam Neua and Phong. Saly and thc Royal Lao Army now occupies thc frontier posts bordcring ' on China and north Viet-Nam. U.S. policy was reevaluated, following thc Lao Government-Pathet Lao settlement, taking into account the Prime Ministers declaration in January that the Lao Government was dcterrnincd to tolerate no subversion and his request for U.S. assistance, particularly for the purpose of winning the crucial May elections. It was decided to continue U.S. aid as before, but with the clear understanding that provision of such aid dependcd upon future Lao performance. Our effort 'has tEefefore shifted from the negative one of attempting to prevent dis-. astrons concessions to the Patbet Lao to the positive one of helping the Lao Government carry out the settlement already reached, with a mini- ' mum of damage to the Free World position.

Inasmuch as the Pathct Lao have apparently chosen to concentrate on political means to achieve their ends, the ' lte-rraHon and demobilization of Pathct Lao forces have taken place relatively smoothly and thc Lao National Array has moved into the two former Pathct Lao provinces. The Pathet Lao made an all-out effort in thc May 4 .  nationwide election campaign for 21 National Assembly seats, utilia.ng well-organized grass-roots cells and demobilized PathetLao soldiers as propaganda agents. Firm final results have not yet been announced but . it may safely' be assumed that the communists (Nco Lao Halt Xat) have won . , 9 seats and the.Neutralists (Santiphab) have won 4 out of 21 seats at issue .' in the cleCtions. Since there arc 8 leftists in the National Assembly al- ready, a leftist coalition could possibly control about onethird of the . BCat3 in the new enlarged Assembly (as many as 21 out of 59 seats). A1- though Lao officials claim that the strong showing of communist candidates .- '. ' SECRET      SECRET docs not indicate a choice of communism by thc Lao electorate but simply a protest vote against war and corruption and in favor of peace, neutrality' and new faces, it is clear that the Neo Lao Mak Xathas emerged as a wcli-orgamaed and disciplined legal political party whose aim is to estab lish communist control of Laos, probably by parliamentary means. Tho conservative leaders have bccn badly shaken by tile com- munista show of strength which resulted largely from conservative failure to agree on a minimum consolidated list of candidates. Available figures indicate that conservative candidates received a clear majority of the ' popular vote but that conservatives got only a minority of the scats at stake. It is possible for the conservatives; if given a little organization ' and discipline,t and reasonably effective leadcrship, to form an all- . conservative government. They have a majority of .the enlarged Assem- Lly and thcy possess the psychological advantage of having received a popular majority in the elections.

Negotiations to achieve a single realistic ratc of exchange without trade and exchange restrictions were pursucd ' 1 first in Vientiane and later in Washington during and after the Lao Prime Ministers visit. Because the U. S. could not guarantee that immediate 'A- devaluation would not jeopardize conservative chances in the clcctions, as unanimously contended by Lao loaders, the U.S agreed that monetary reform should not take place until some time after thc recent supplementary elections. The U.S. insisted, however, that new releases of aid dollars be placed in a segregated escrow account ponding devaluation and assurances that tho ultimate kip value would eventually be deposited into the counterpart fund. The U.S. declined to effect further dollar transfer (project aid was not suspended) owing to the Lao Government's reluctance to accept lenient escrow arrangements offered. Soandalous import licensing vas stopped when negotiations led to acceptance by the Lao ' Government of new procedures proposed by the U.S. There have bccn no abuscs since. The Lao Government proposed that U.S, aid dollars ... henceforth be placed in a segregated account in the Lao National Bank ' and not bc used until agreement is reached between thc U.S. and Laos . on such matters. The U.S. agreed that this device would be acceptable- until negotiations are reopencd in June in the hope that this would accomplish U.S. objectives and also permit thc Lao to save face. 27.

However, economic nationalism and ex-cessive government intervention continue to discourage private foreign . and domestic investment. Moreover, it is likely the Government of Viet-Nam will continue to insist that certain larger industrial projects be government-controlled, at least in their early years of operations. Poetical and Security Problems of the Diem Government President Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of striet control in the political and n economic fields has caused a certain amount of internal dissatisfaction. Should the Presidents exercise of personal authority develop too far f ore '' may bc dangcr that the resultant frustration of governmentofficials nghf " weaken thc united support for his regime which the situation, requires. Likewise, the Prcsidcnts stern policc measures and his emphasis on internal security have led to some critioisin of the government. This cm-. phasis on internal security stems from the rccent emergence of the country, the continuation of communist-inspired violcnce and subversion, and such incidents as the assassination of local officials in rural areas of southern Viet-Nam,   .

It was further agreed that the term "Hot Pursuit" as elloy-cl in NSC 54295, paragraph. 5-g, .and NSC 5cO4 must be regarded as ucrcly descriptive of the policy established, by those tenors rather than the legal justification for such policy. Ths international law doctrine of "Hot Pursuit". cannot, alone, be relied on to justify the action requiredand reliance on thc.t legal doctrine, would not appear to ce esaertial to the purpose of the documents. Eecnusa of those co-'.-siclercbions, ano. because the cbveloprtnt of a certain ovnt of confusion between ths r.on-legal descriptive qualities and. the juridical ile?lications of thc term "Hot Pursuit" cannot he avoided, it was felt that its usage in the ESC papers under discussion is tult.esire-.ole. .At least one represento.tive (navy) indicated, that his service had eemerienced certain opare.tion.al difficulties in prep-ring for irolementing NSC policy, simply cacnuso Navy personnel are accustomed to using the. term "Kot Pursuit" in strict international law sense. The meeting considered vhsther it would. be advisable to adopt the term "Defensive Pursuit" in lieu of "l.bt Pursuit", as suggested, in the JCS paper. This solution, however, was objected to cn the groncl that it would amount to the creation of a row term of art in interna.tio-.nl lav and that irthsr.-ore it was, on its face, somewhat misleading. It was apparent that agreereent could, not ba readily obtained e-tong ths lawyers in the Gove-'ent on the coining of this new term. In view of the foregoing, it was the consensus of the meeting t?.at confusion could best ce avoided by eliminating altogether the use of legal tesn-inolepy in describing the plo'-icy sot forth in the two nSv papers. ln other "wouCj, no terms of art were necessary to describe the policy obviously intended.. Moreover, it was -the unanimous vieW of the meeting that the legal terminology could he eliminated, frcr. the two NSC papers in question without any change whatever in the subst-ntive meaning of these planers. Accordingly, it ws a greed, to re coenc. t? t the ambiguous words "Hot Pursuit" be stricken from ira 5-4295 (paragraph 5f) and NSC 5'604 and that i their plane should ce substituted ths werds "Immediate Pur suit" which have no specialized connotations in lam. Thus, NSC 54295, paragraph 5g, should be redrafted, to read, ns follows (1) Issue a directive to its erred forces that, in the event of unprovoked. unist arm.se. attack a gainst U.

COTtENTlAL i , October 23, 19?8 JOS STOOY on HOT PURSUIT ARD PURSUIT L1D3R DOCTRINE OF SlWBREiiWnTIOti '.1 w 1. Tire term "hot pursuit" has been used, in various joint and service papers, as well as by Commanders in the field, in connection with the protective measures United States military forces are authorized to take in self-defense. The term has also been used with reference to its special meaning under international law. The purpose of this taper ' is to clarify the concepts involved with a view to eliminating some of the confusion which has arisen from the interchangeable use of the term. 2. The term "hot pursuit" has a WeIl-establishad and special meaning in international law. It is recognised as the right of a coastal State to pursue COMMERCIAL vessels of a foreign State suspected of violating the laws or regulations of the coastal State appolicable to its territorial sea or contiguous zone. Basically, it is a peacetime concept not connected with hostilities or the threat of hostilities by the military forces of a State. Pursuit under this doctrine does not include the , right topursue warships or military aircrafu, or for that --outer any type of aircraft. In addition, under -custom and practice, hot pursuit may be undertaken only under certain limited conditions. For enaple, thepursued vessel or one of its boats must be within the territorial sea or contiguous zone of the coast?.?. State before pursuit can begin. Once the pursued ship enters the territorial waters of its flag stats or e. third state, the right of hot pursuit ends. .Although hot pursuit say be undertaken for a violation of any law or regulation enactec. pursuant to the sovereign authority of the boagtal State when the violation occurs within internal waters or the territorial sea, it can be undertaken, for a violation of only those lavs covering customs, fiscal, ieigraticn, or sanitary matters when the violation occurs within the continueus sons. 3. In marked contrast, the right of pursuit under the doctrine of self-preservation or self-defence is a. much broader concept, not dependent on the territorial sea or contiguous aone. International leo recognizes the right of a State to take whatever measures are necessary for its self-defense. A unit of tire armad forces of the United States in ume 01 peace imy repel or reesu any nostile act co ivc or . threatened against it by foreign vessels or aircraft. The right to repel and resist includes "the right of pursuit" where considered feasible and necessary to ensure the safety of threatened forces or territory. In this connection, a hostile act has been defined in various instructions as "any act which involves a clear and presart dsnger to ths security o. cne Un. ceo. Status or its xomes tsmtory possessions or territory under the United States administration." So example3 cf what may constitute hostile acts are .

Progress was irregular in assisting the countries in Southcast Asia to develop toward stable, frcc rcprescntative governments with the will and ability to resist communism, The danger that any of them may pass into the communist orbit varies from country to country, Thailand, Viet-Nam and the Federation of Malaya maintained an anti-communist position. A drift toward political confusion in Burma was , interrupted by General Ne V;in's acceonion to the premiership and his  immediate stand against communism. The. Lao Governm .nt withstood neutralist-and .communist efforts to overthrow it, eliminated communists  from cabinet positions and took initial steps toward countering communist political and subversive progress in the countryside. Its prospects of successfully varding off communist subversion and achieving stability have improved considerably since; the low point reached in the May elections, but genuine non-communist unity has not yet been achieved, Cambodia, while maintaining its neutral position, made a owing to the left in recog.

SEATO Graduate School of Engineering,, A moot successful Council meeting ; A ' ..was held in Manila in March which authorized thc Secretary General to cntei into limited contact with other regional defense orffani nations and agreed to a proposal that contact with nonrncmbcr states be continued ' and expanded. Some progress was made in dcveloping regional projects. Agreements were signed in June with Tliaitand, Viet-Nam and Laos to provide $27 million of U. S. funds toward the cost of a regional tele- ' communications sydtcm. Funds were also tentatively earma.rked for the possible inclusion of Cambodia. A mild expression of interest by Burma .f for participation in the project has been explored, and Burmese participa- . tion seems unlikely in the near future. ICA has appointed the prime engineering contractor for the project. A second regional project relating to . English language teaching has fallen behind schedule because of problems in .i'obtaining thc participating countries1 under standing of the project and in .drawing up thc necessary documentation,-  L . There have been two main themes in Southeast Asian attitudes' toward the Taiwan Strait crisis, Thc initial note of fear that the whole area might be involved in war was replaced, to a large extent, by satisfaction that the U. S. did not back down on this issue. ' f c Progress in preventing Southeast Asian countries from becoming economically dependent upon the communist bloc varies from country to country. Seemingly generous trade and aid offers from communist bloc countries have proved tempting to some Southeast Asian nations. , Burma and Cambodia have bccn most vulncrable. In Singapore and thc Fed era'ion of Malaya the Chinese Communists, for instance, operate through banking and trading interests. The Federation is taking stops to reduce thc influence of the Communist Bank of China. In Thailand, the volum- of imports from Communist China, which is small but increasing, has important propaganda value to thc communists. Laos has so far resisted Chinese Communist trade and aid offers. Even assuming favorable political dcclop- mcnts, many uncertainties exist for thc economic cleveloprnent of SouC cast ; Asia. Some obvious weaknesses include limited understanding by govern" ment and other leaders of the elements csscntial to economic development aijd mobilization of capital, both domestic and foreign, lack of managerial and technical experience, lack of diversity in export commodities and-vulnerability to price fluctuations for these commodities. Some appro-hcnsion exists regarding the possibility of obtaining reasonable prices for thc favorable rice, crops now expected in thc area, particularly Burma. 2, No review of policy is recommendedN ' 'ItSECRET      SECRET 1 themselves have not been sufficient to effect a rate of growth satisfactory to these underdevelopcd cotmtries'which tend increasingly to compare their nati on al economic progress with that claim cd by c om m uni s t c ontr oll e d A s ian countries. The urgency of the problem is emphasized by.the developing communist cconomic offensive. From the U. S. standpoint, dissatisfaction is particularly important in these countrics, which have come to expect . that their alignment vith tbc free world will bring them thc external vias si stance needed for more rapid economic development. Status of U S. Actions Considerable progress has been made. during this period in defining policies and thelroad approaches which the United States will employ in increasing our effectiveness in assisting these countries to achieve a satisfactory rate of development. Thcsc policies and approaches were summarized in the Presidents recent speech to the Colombo Plan Conference in Seattle and arc applicable, to all underdeveloped areas, including Southeast Asia. Thc President, presented a program addressed to the following major requirements for economic growth ... a, expanded international trado ..l  b. technical skills . '; . ! . c. private investment , i d. normal bankable loans . '..n't . rC'- , c, financing to cover other sound projects which will afford . the borrower flexibility regarding terms of repayment. Action to moot some of the requirements under each of these points is receiving considerable emphasis in present programs. Considcra," tion is being given to increasing thc emphasis on other elements not yet. adequately developcd. The President has Created the Draper Committee to consider, among other things, the impact of our military assistance pro-grams on those related portions and objectives of the mutual security effort which are directed primarily at the cconomic betterment and growth, of the . , free world and to appraise thc relative emphasis which should be given to military and economic programs, particulatrly in the less developed areas. Certain other major problems involved in carrying out current programs . are also under study by such groups as thc Straus Study Group and the World Economic Practices Committee. The problem of economic development as it relates to- Souths east Asia reflects the need for clarification of U.

Status, of U. S. Actions With a vie.- to offsetting thc high political impact of Communist aid projects, the U, S. continued to pub-licize the more dramatic aCcornplishrnents of U. S. aid programs. In this connection such a program as PL 480 assistance in thc form of raw cotton .for processing in third countries was one means of curbing further Chinese Communist inroads into the textile market. A. supporting factor in off-setting communist aid projects is that remittances from overseas Chinese to relatives on the mainland have decreased markedly since thc estab-iishmcnt of peoples communes. From August to October, remittances through the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China reportedly dropped 40 percent to the lowest volume since 1955, and a similar decrease, is reported from Singapore, Part of this reduction is attributed by some to the development of communes on thc mainland. 7, Economic Aid Program Delays. Despite recent irnprovcments, thc impact of aid program delays on U. S relations in the area and on the ability of the U. S. to meet the cconomic challenge of the communist bloc requires continued attention and emphasis at high levels within State and . " IC A on eliminating these difficulties. Specifically, project approval pro- cedures, contracting and procurement still need faster handling. Personnel selection, though greatly improved, requires continuing attention. Status of Uc S. Actions Substantially faster program approvals have occurred this year under new programming procedures. Progress has also been made in ths initiation of corrective measures to reduce delays in implementing econociic aid activities. Several of these improvements stem from action by the special committee recently established under thc  ICA Director' . ' '  . Thc problem of delays has bcen made more acute in thc past by premature Commitments and assuranccs of aid. New legislation c ec-five this year prohibits obligation of any economic ?.s si stance funds for projccts costing over $100- 000 and requiring substantive technical or financial planning until necessary engineering, financial or other plans arecompleted and a reasonably firm cost estimate made, On the other hand, the , new lcgielation will also tend to incrcase the amount of time required between formulation and initiation of certain projects# Eh Political Instability.

During the five-month period preceding Prince Sihanouks recent visit to the Unitcd States, place-ment of USIS procs material and other non-USIS originated material which supported U.

The decline in the usage of U. 8. material was Caused by the Ministry of Information's prejudicial treatment of the U.

SUMMARY EVALUATION , ' . 1 ' ' 32. Developments rclatcd particularly to a U. S. coursc of action to assist Free Viet-Nam to develop-a strong, stable and constitutional government which would-work toward thc weakening of thc communists in both North and South Viet-Nam. President Diem remained firmly in control despite some political dissatisfaction with his government. As a strongly committed anti-communist country, Viet-Nam displayed a serious concern about developments in Laos, Cambodias recognition of Communist China, ' and thc U. S. position in thc Taiwan Straits. The communists and dissi" dents continued their campaign of assassinations, especially of officials in rural areas and carried out attacks aimed at disrupting Viet-Nam 's eco-nomic progress. Although thc government gave increasing attention to ,r . development of the economy, such development continued to be inhibited by y almost pre-emptive military requirements which utilized a substantial . portion of Viet-Nams total resources, including IL S. aid. At the same time, communist North Viet-Nam continued to exploit for political ahd psychological purposes its own reportedly rapid economic development, ' B MAJOR OPERATING PROBLEMS FACING THE UNITED STATES 33. Diems Internal Political Position. Diem increased his travels throughout thc country for the purpose of popularising his regime. Increasing accomplishments of the government in the economic and social fields should also have beneficial political results. Nevertheless, the .failure of the government to fully rally certain elements of the middle class, the inteltectusls and former officials to its support, the frustration and restlessness of some of the present officials, and some discontent iu. the army are souroes of political weakness. This dissatisfaction is caused primarily by tho autbocMtarian and pervasive political controls of thc Ngo family and Its associateb. Status of U. So Astions The desirability of liberalizing political and adrpinistrative controls is brought to thc attention of the Vi< -namese GoVerument, when considered appropriate by the U. Se. Ambassador, Possible lines of U. S. action are greatly limited duo'to thc extreme sensi-' tivity di Vievnameoc leaders on this subjcct. I 34, Internal Security. It has become increasingly clear the.t the communists, no longer expectant that Free Viet-Nam will fall-to their control through peaceful methods, are executing c. carefully planned campaign of violence aimed at tyndcxnnninrr the stability of the Diem Governpaent. 1186 . .'

Their concentration of activitics in rural areas where communications, and I terrain make it difficult for the government to cope with them recalls the tactics used against the. French during thc Indochina War. Assassinations, particularly of officials in rural areas, continue at an alarming rate of about fifteen to thirty-five a month. Attacks on rubber plantations and . reported communist piano to break up the land dovclopment, land reform and . agricultural credit programs indicate deliberate efforts to interfere with t Viet-Nama economic programs. , ' Status of U.S. Actions After a long period of ncgotiation, President Ngo Dinh Diem has now agrecd to place the Civil Guard under thc ,. ' Minister of Interior. The Embassy and the Government of Viet-Nam havereached an understanding on a program to be presented to Washington for training and equipping the Civil Guard to enable it to copc with the situation described above. Thc program, if approved, would be for the training and equipping of only about 32, 000 of the Civil Guard and not thc total current force of 48, 000. A major question is whether this situation requires an im- provement in the Civil Guard, or whether other existing Vietnamese security forces, including thc Army, can adequately deal with thc situation. Thio question is being diccuoscd by the agencies concerned but agrecrncnt lias not yct bccn rcachcd, . 35. Economic Development. Economic development, though pro- grossing, is stilt at a rate below that which is politically necessary to enable Free Viet-Nam to compete successfully with the communist regime in North Viet-Nam. The rate of development is also below what is politically desir- able in order to cnable Vict-Nam ultimately to reduce its heavy dependence upon external assistance. This problem is further exacerbated at the present time bccause demands on available resources to meet the communist military and subverx We threat are rising. It appears doubtful, therefore, whethcr our political objectives can be achieved to the degree desired. Status of U. S, A ctions Mcans of mobilizing additional Viet- . namcGC resources for development are under study by thc Vietnamese . Government. Defense support aid available for economic development was reduced by $40 million in FY 1958 and further reduced by $15-20 million in . FY 1959. Victnamese access to thc Development Loan Fund (which is expected as soon as project enginecring studies are complete) may offset the FY, .1.959 reduction but will probably not bring total aid available fordevelopment back.to. the FY 1 $57 level, ..-  SECRET  .

(Prepared by CIA without inter-agency coordination as an Informal document for use by thc OCB Working Group and as background for the information of tho-GGB and the NSC) ' 40. General Bloc Policy The Sino-Soviet bloc is actively working to encourage neutralism in Southeast Asia) to destroy the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and to encourage the creation of a group of independent, nationalist anti-Western entities which might ultimately come under close Sino-Soviet. influence. ( 41. Bloc policy has been flexible amd opportunistic, adjusting itself to the degree of anti-communism evident in each state. Peiping and Moscow have avoided pressing too urgently and have sought to influence by example thc states in which conditions have been most favorable to them. Thus in Cambodia and in. Burmaat least up to the change in government- where bloc activity has been most pronounced, Moscow and Pciping have attempted to be circumspect and have tried to fulfill economic aid agreements smoothly and satisfactorily.  .  U 42. Communist China and thc USSR for the most part appear to have reserved a judgment for the present on developments potentially adverse, to them in Burma, Laos, and Malaya. Thc bloc continues to stand on-a pro fessed plank of noninterference in thc internal affairs of other states embodied in the "Five Principles" enunciated by Chou En-lai and Nehru in 1954. Chou . repeated hisadvice" to Cambodias Chinese to 'refrain from taking part in. political activities'1 during the August visit of Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk -' ' to Peiping. <  43. The immediate aim of local Communist parties is two-foldto achieve legality and eventually to turn thcir govornmcntspolicies into neu tralist channels. The USSR and Communist China complement that aim by i discreet and frequent offers of "disinterested" economic aid and wider cultural rotations. '   J 44. DiplornatiC Activity. Repcated bloc initiatives to expand diplomatic representation met with success in Cambodia but not in Laos. Cambodia, which already has resident missions from the USSR and Czechoslovakia, recognized CommunistChina in July and ambassadors have been exchanged. This is a significant diplomatic victory for Peiping in Southes-st Asia and x ill considerably raise Communist Chinas prestige among thc Overseas Chinese  ... in thc area. Malayan Prime Minister Abdul Rahman continues bis policy of  ' SECRET " ?.  w . , .   .     ' SECRET refusing any formal relations with thc bloc until the ten year Communist rebellion in Malaya is ended' 45. Burma has the broadest bloc representation, having relations with the USSR, Communist China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and Mongolia. In Thailand only thc USSR maintains a mission which, with some JO officials, ie considerably overstaffcd in terms of the work at hand, Except for some Z5 Polish officials on thc International Control Commission, there titc-no bloc officials in South Vict-Nam.   I  46. Econornio Activity Malaya, with its large Chinese population, has . A >een a focal point of Communist China's commcrcial drive in Southeast Asia. r Peiping is competing with Japan and Hong Kong and has intensified its trade nroniotion activities in Singapore since April. A wide variety of new Chinesef joriimodities are appearing at prices slashed 10--20 percent below those of . f normal suppliers, Thc effectiveness of this campaign is reflected in a 40 i. nerccnt rise fa the value of Chinese Communist goods imported during thc irst seven months of 1958 over thc comparable period in 1957. Malayas total C . exports to the bloc from December 1957 through May 1958 were about $43 million. Compared with thc first half of 1957, exports to the bloc as a vholc increased during the December-May period by .42 percent and imports declined 5 percent. Communist China was once again the principal bloc  rarcbaser.  Thc marked increase in exports xvas caused by a doubling of -ubber oxports to 75,800 long tons--l5 pcrcent of Malayas total rubber Ni uports in thc first half of 1958. p- . ...  V 47. China's drive for cconomic influence in Malaya,niay-hov.evor, be . jeopardized by recent Peiping threats of trade sanctions against Malaya and lingapore in retaliation for anti-Peiping rnovcs by the Federation govern.-' .ncnt. Even if trade is only temporarily affected, Peipings actions.have . caused sharply critical comment in the Federation and Jiave bolstcred thc ' ; alliance governmonts determination to curtail Chinese Communist economic . , activities.' ' .. 4 ' 48, Cambodia made its first import allocations in April under trade agreements with the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Communist China. The valtic of export liccnscs issued was much lower than the level set for imports. ' i ' However, the allocations totaled about $2, 600, 000 and, if actually used, would raise imports from the bloc in 1958 to at least 10 percent of Cambodias . r planned imports, exclusive of thosc under aid programs. ' 49. The lcvcl of bloc trade with Thailand cohtinucs to be lcss than one ' percent of total trade because of thc relatively satisfactory economic con- ditions in Thailand, its pro-voct alignment, and extensive American aid. Thailand refused Soviet formal trade overtures in March, but did lift its ; ' SECRET . 1178.  .    SECRET ; . j . .. ' . 4 embargo on rubber exports to Communist China and North Korea on 22 August. An undetermined amount of illegal trade with Chinese Communists is transacted through Hong Kong. Burmese trade with thc bloc continues to decline, and rice commitments to tire bloc in 1958 have been cut back to ... 40, 000 tons. Total trade declined in 1957 to $57, 500, 000 or 11 percent of < . Burmas foreign trade. Bloc trade with Laos and South Viet-Nam remains negligible# .  50, In thc field of cconomic aid, b!oc activities arc concentrated on Burma and Cambodia. Cambodia is now in thc second phase of a $22, 400, 000 Chinese Communist grant-in-aid program, which appears to be proceeding , smoothly. Phnom Penh has completed plans for various social and economic projccts and sites have been sclccted for thc four plywood, Cement, paper, and textile factories that form thc core of the program. At thc end of Sihanouks Peiping visit, Cambodia acccptcd an additional grant of i $5, 600, 000 and Peiping offered to expand thc program to include construction of small iron and steel works and surveys of undcrground fuel resources. In addition, a Cambodian cconomic delegation headed by the economic planning counselor sent to the USSR completed preliminary economic and technical aid talks in September. Construction is now underway on the Soviet "gift"  hospital in Phnom Penh and Cambodia has included in its 1958 import plan $1, 000, 000 worth of aicWinanced goods to raise funds to defray local costs. 51. Bloc countries, principally the USSR, have extended an estimated $41, 600, 000 in loans to Burma, Implementation of Soviet "gift" projects appears to be progressing satisfactorily and construction has begun on the technological institute in Rangoon, a ploy factory, and irrigation projects. Two Soviet loans totaling approximately $8, 500, 000 were announced in early 1958 but have not yet bcen implemented. Communist China completed expansion of a foven nent-owned textile factory during thc first half of 1958. k ' j . 5?.. There wete approximately 140 bloc technicians in Burma in thc first. half of 1958 and the number of Soviet technicians will undoubtedly increase markedly as work on the Rangoon Technological Institute progresses. In Cambodia there wore.about 30 bloc technicians, mostly from Communist China; additional Soviet Chinese technicians are expected. (Note There . arc current unconfirmed reports that the Ne Win Government intends to cancel bloc technicians contracts but no action has so far bcen fatten.) 53. Cultural and Propaganda Activity Thc bloc shift to winter schedules brought an increasc in weekly broadcast output in native languages from 79 to 93 hours. Bloc services in Burmese rose from 10. 5 to 17. 5 hours, and Pciping increased its Cambodian service from 7 to 10. 5 hours weekly. There tog a slight increase in total Vietnamese veckly output. In addition, Moscow raised its English language broadcasts to South and Sonthcast Asia from 17.5 to 19.75 hours weeklylid-= .; . ! ' SECRET .     7 ' SECi  . 54. Bloc propaganda activities have bccn especially marked in Cam-- bodia, where Communist China, the USSR, and North Viet-Nam have all made rapid progress in thc film field. During thc first nine, months of 1958 over r Soviet films appcared as compared with a total of 15 to 20 during all ot 1957. A number of Chincsc technicians havc arrived in Phnom Penh to . install the 20 kw radio transmitter presented to Sihanouk last year. The bloc's propaganda efforts within Cambodia havc becn aimed primarily at youth . through tho educational syctcm, and Soviet diplomatic peruonncl have continued to make aggressive efforts along this linej 55. Subversive Activity.- Bloc omcials in thc arca have usually con- centrated on developing correct cordial relations with constituted authorities. Covcrt contacts, however, arc maintained through embassies and through . Chincsc. Communist '-controlled banks in placcs such as Burma and SingaporeThe banks providc legitimate financial support to pro-Pciping adherents and j . arc also a means of f-ychological and economic pressure on the population, 56, Communist China e>ploits extensively pro-Peiping elements within Overseas Chinese communities throughout thc area. These groups are . culturally to a large extent resident aliens regardless of formal citizenship and they arc drawn toward the 'homeland" regardless of politics. ' . 57. In.Thailand, South Viet-Nam, Malaya, and Singapore the Communist parties are outlawed and for the most part fragmented. Although aid may unve.been given from time to time to insurrections y forces, both the bloc . , id local Communists gcnerally would prefer legality to continued illegal  and guerrilla activity. Bloc subversive efforts havc becn aimed primarily it stimulating existing discontent among non Communists. '. 58. The developing political situation- in Laos, where the Communist ' dominated Neo Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ) won 13 of the 21 assembly seats up for election last Mey, has shown thc Communists to bc successful in using lcgal md semi-legal tactics. The victory was made possible by superior NLEIZ rrass roots orfganizatioh and by lack of unity among non-com muni st elements who won a majority of the popular vote but dissipated this advantage by running too many candidates. Thc NLEIZ appears to be making strong gains in almost evcry scctor of Laotian society including a swell of pro-NLHZ sentiment among Laos 13, 000 Buddhist monks who have some influence cz or rillage opinion.

' 60 Some resentment against Communist China has been evidcnccd in . i Burma over thc protractedChinese border dispute and in Burma and Malaya 1 over bloc efforts on behalf of opposition parties or dissidents. Singapore and Malaya both have becn irritated by Russian tin dumping on the world . market and by Chinese Communist textile dumping, On 1 October Singapore and Malaya restricted imports of Chinese tcxtiles. f. 61. Outlook The Sino-Sovict blocs fluid and opportunistic approach i  s , .-   t withili thc framework of a pclioy of dcvcloping wider contacts and relations on all levels with the nations of the area, vJll probably continue. The f  development of sentiment that is initially neut ralist, indcpcndent, and ! nationalist vilt remain thc general bloc aim.

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF washington, D.C. 20301 JCSM-97-59 19 Mar 1959 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Subject Airfields for Vietnam (U) 1. Reference is made to the memorandum by the Joint Chief of Staff, for the Secretary of Defense, dated 18 December 1958, subject, "Jet Aircraft for Vietnam (U)." 2. Subparagraph 4 b of the referenced memorandum states that it is deemed advisable to request the International Cooperation Administration to include Cap St Jacques in addition to Tan Son Nhut in their program for airfield im-provement, under the guise of commercial aviation. 3. Subsequent review by CINCPAC and the Joint Chiefs of Staff indicates that Tourane would be preferable to Cap St Jacques. Tourane's advantages outweigh its relative vulnera-bility. Its forward position would be operationally useful. Its improvement would require less money and time than would Cap St Jacques. Tourane's position on the Bangkok-Hong Kong air route lends plausibility to its development as a commer-cial jet facility. 4. It is recommended that Tourane be substituted for Cap St Jacques in the International Cooperation Administration's improvement program as the proposed second jet facility for Vietnam. 5. It is requested that you advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff of your position and the views of the Department of State on this matter, i order that CINCPAC may, in turn, be informed. For the Joint Chiefs of Staff N. F. TWINING, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff 1184      January 22, 1959 MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF SUBJECT Aircraft for Vietnam (U) By memorandum dated 30 December 1958, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that thirty (30) AD-4 type aircraft be substituted for T-28s in the Vietnam Military Assistance Program to replace F-8F aircraft now used by the Vietnamese Air Force. We are advised by the Air Force that the F-8F aircraft are supportable through Fiscal Year 1960 and probably through Fiscal Year 1962 and, although obsolescent by U.S. standards, remain capable of performing their mission, while a more advanced capability for the Vietnam Air Force is both militarily and politically desirable, we question the advisability of introducing AD-4 aircraft at this time. Although the ASCP rate for the F-8F aircraft is extremely low(average less than 2$ for the last 18 months) the utilization rate (monthly average 7 hours per assigned aircraft during Fiscal Year 1958) is very unsatisfactory. This unsatisfactory utilization rate, which is 5Oo of the programmed flying hour requirement, is because of high unscheduled maintenance rate and substandard logistic practices, aggravated by a lack of trained supply and maintenance personnel. The result has been an in-commission rate of less than 35 during the past few months. This poor maintenance and an inability to operate the logistics and supply facilities necessary to support these aircraft are partially due to the fact that the Vietnamese are changing over from a French operated system to a U.S. recommended system which must be operated by the Vietnamese themselves. Because of the above and the tightness of the 1959 program and in light of the coming Congressional presentation, we believe it advisable, until there is improvement in Vietnamese training and maintenance, and at least until Fiscal Year 1960, to withhold the proposed substitution of AD-4 aircraft for the F-8F aircraft.

Thc prospect of reunification of Com-munist North Vietnam (DRV) and west-ern-oriented South Vietnam (GVN) re-mains remote. In thc DRV thc full range of Communist techniques is used to con-trol the population, socialize thc economy, impose austerity and direct investment to cconomic rehabilitation and development. Thc DRV maintains large armed' forces. In South Vietnam, despite the authoritarian nature of thc regime, there it is far more freedom. Local resources and ! US aid are devoted to developing the  armed forces, maintaining internal se-> curity, and supporting a relatively high standard of living, with lesser emphasis ' on economic development. (Para. 9) 2. In South Vietnam political stability depends heavily upon President Diem and his continued control of the instruments , of power, including the army and police. Diem will almost certainly be President for many years. Thc regime will con-tinue to repress potential opposition ele. ments and depend increasingly upon the efiecitvcness of the Can Lao, the regimes political apparatus, which is Diems brothers Nhu and Can. 11-14, 29-31) run by (Paras. 3. The capabilitiesj of the GVN armld forces will improve given continued US materiel support and training. Con-tinuance of the present level of training is threatened by a recent finding of the InternaUonal Control Commission (ICC) that the US Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission (TERM) should end its activities by mid-1959. In any event, GVN forces will remain incapable of with-standing more than temporarily the larger DRV forces. ' Thc internal security' forces will not be kble to eradicate DRV v supported guerrilla or subversive activity in the foreseeable future. Army units.. will probably have to be diverted to special internal security assignments. (Paras. 15-17, 33-34) 4.

IL will probably remain unwill-ing to devote a significantly greater share of resources and attention to longer range economic development. Assuming continued US aid at about present levels, modest improvement in South Vietnams economic position is likely. However, de- velopment will lag behind that in the  North, and the GVN will continue to rely heavily upon US support to close the gap between its own resources and its requirements. (Paras. 19-22, 32) 5. There is little prospect of a significant improvement in relations between South Vietnam.and Cambodia so long as the present leaders of the two countries re-main in power. Relations with Laos will probably remain generally friendly. Continued suspicion that the French arc intriguing in thc area to recapture a posi-tion of major influence will probably pre vent an improvement of Franco-GVN relations. (Paras. 25-27, 35) G. Despite widespread popular discontent, the Government of the DRV is in full control of thc country and no significant internal threat to the regime is likely. With large-scale Bloc aid, considerable progress lias been made in rehabilitating and developing the economy with niajor emphasis on agriculture, raw materials and light industry. Thc regime will (probably soon have laid thc foundations for considerable economic expansion. (Paras. 37-38, 42, 44) I 7. The DRV has no diplomatic relations with any country outside thc Bloc and its foreign pdicy is subservient to thc Bloc. We believe that it (will continue its harassment of the GVN and of Leos, though a military invasion of either is unlikely. (Parts. 46, 48-49) INTRODUCTION 8. Thc 1954 provisional military demarcation line dividing Vietnam at thc l7th parallel has become a fixed boundary separating two cn-trenched and hostile governments, the Gov-ernmerd of Vietnam (GVN) in the south and the Communist Democratic Republic of Viet-. nam (DRV) in thc north. Thc all-Vietnam elections callcd for under the Gcneva Agree-ments of 1954 havc not becn held, and the divergent conditions demanded by both gov-ernments preclude thc holding of such clec-tions. To date the GVN has bccn preoccupied with the threat to internal security posed by DRV subversion and guerrilla warfare and with thc threat that thc Communists numerically superior armed forces will one day invade the south. However, there are no indications that the DRV is willing to assume the risks of US intervention and attempt to conquer South Vietnam by military invasion. Such a dccision would probably bo made by Pciping and Moscow rather than by Hanoi. 9. Meanwhile life on thc two sides of thc bourn.' ry is marked by an increasing dispar-ity. Thc north is organized along strict Com-munist lines. Thc standard of living is low; life is grim and regimented; and thc national effort, is concentrated on building for the future. The DRV claims it has reduced its reliance on Bloc aid to about one-third of its national budget. Its large army is almost entirely financed domestically, except for arms delivered by the Bloc. Both its foreign aid and its Spartanly acquired domestic capital arc devoted to restoring and increasing productive capacity in agriculture and industry. In thc south thc standard of living is much higher and thcre is far (more freedom and gaiety. However, South Vietnams cconomic development is still at an early and uncertain SECRET 1      3 SECRET stage, and basic cconomic growth has bcen slower than that of the north. Thc GVN still depends upon US aid to finance about two-thirds of its national budget, including -most of the support for the armed forces. I 12. An increasingly important and effective I mechanism employed by thc Diem regime to maintain control over thc affairs of South Vietnam is thc Can Lao, a scmicovert political apparatus. Its structure, like that of thc Kuomintang or a Communist party, is based on thc cell and cadre system. The Can Lao is organizcd on a regional basis. Thc southern region is run by Nhu, an articulate, pragmatic activist, lt is loosely organized and administered. The northern region is ruled with an iron hand by Can, a withdrawn eccentric feared by mostpietnamese, who seldom ventures from his headquarters in Hue. Although there is considerable rivalry and ten-sion between thc two brothers, there is no evidence that either is Icss than completely loyal to Diem. Diem apparently finds it ad-vantagcous to continue the division of author-ity as a means of controlling thc ambitions of Nhu and Can. 13. Can Lao members are active at virtually every level of Vietnamese political lifc. Ment-bership is becoming increasingly important for professional advancement. One-third of the cabinet members and over one-half of the National Assembly deputies are probably Can Lao men; the act.!-. ! figure may-bc higher. The Can Lao controls the regimes mass political party, thc National Revolutionary Movement. It apparently has its hand in most important business transactions in South Vietnam and is engaged in dubious business practices. Decently the Can Lao has stopped up . its campaign to recruit key officers in thc GVN military establishment, probably to establish a control mechanism within the only organi-zation in South Vietnam strong nough to challenge thc Diem regime. 14. Although the popular enthusiasm attend- 1 ant on thc achicving of independer e and the end of colonial rule has subsided and some disillusion has arisen, particularly among the > . educated elite, there appears to bc little iden-  II unable public unrest. There is some dissat-isfaction among military officers largely be- ' cause of increasing Can Lao meddling in mili-tary affairs. Thc growth of dissatisfaction is inhibited by South Vietnams continuing high standard of living relative to that of its neigh- I. MAJOR TRENDS IN SOUTE1 VIETNAM A. Political Trends . rlO. President Diem continues to be the undisputed ruler of South Vietnam; all important and many minor decisions are referred to him. V) Although he professes to bclievc in representa-tivc government and democracy, Diem is convinced that the Vietnamese are not ready for such a political system and that he must . rule with a firm hand, at least so long as na-tional security is threatened. He also believes that the country cannot afford a political i opposition which could obstruct or dilute the government's efforts to.establish c hong and secure state. Although respected for his ' courage, dedication, and integrity, Diem has remained a somewhat austere and remote fig-. ure to most Vietnamese and has not generated widespread popular enthusiasm. 11. Diems regime reflects his ideas. A facade of representative government is maintained, but the government is in fact essentiaJly authoritarian. Thc legislative powers of the , National Assembly arc strictly circumscribed; the judiciary is undeveloped and subordinate J to thc executive; and thc members of thc ; executive branch arc little more than the per-sona(agents of Diem. No organized opposi-tion, ioyal or otherwise, is tolerated, and critics of thc regime are often repressed. This highly centralized regime has provided resolute and stable direction to national affairs, but it has alienated many of the country's educated Nite and has inhibited thc growth of governmental and political institutions which could carry on in Diems absence. The exer-cisc of power and responsibility is limited to Diem and a very small circle mainly composed of his relatives, the most important being his  brothers Nhu and CanJ Nhu is particularly influential in international affairs and in mat-tors relative to thc southern half of the country. Can is more concerned with internal security and the northern half df the country. SEC n E T .

The Communist apparatus in South Victnam is essentially an operating arm of thc North Vietnamese Communist Party (Lao Dong), but there havc been recent indications of Chinese operations, about 2000 small units border, the Communist participation in its It is estimated that there are active guerrillas. They are in scattered along the Cambodian south coasts and in the remote plateau region of the north. There are prob-ably several thousand others, now inactive, who havc access to arms and would participate in guerrilla activities if so ordered. Thc guerrillas are able to marshall a force of sev-eral hundred men for major hit-and-run raids, as they demonstrated twice during 1958. They havc recently stepped up their intimidation campaign, assassinating local officials in remote areas, terrorizing local populations and disrupting government operations.' The dis-sident armed remnants of the rcligious sccts are largely broken up. About 2,000 such dis-sidents surrendered to thc government during 1958 and thc few hundred remaining in the jungle are probably now absorbed or domi-nated by the Communists. 16. Thc government has been able to restrict but not eliminate thc subversive and espionage activity s of clandestine Communist agents. It is probable that Communists have penetrated sonic local army and security units, village councils, and local branches of the goVemmcnt, There is no evidence, however, that such penetration is sufficient to hamper government operations seriously or that it extends to thc higher echelons of thc govem-mcnt. There.is probably a widespread Communist underground in the urban areas, es-pccially Saigon, and Communist intelligence of GVN plans and activities is probably good. Communist agents are also stimulating unrest among the tribal minorities in the central highlands, a relatively inaccessible and sparsely ropulated area which thc government is attempting to settle and develop, primarily for security reasons. 17. South Vietnams l3G,000-man army,1 sup-ported by thc Civil Guard, the SeK-Dcfense Corps and the police services, is capable of maintaining cNective internal security except in the most remote junglc and mountain', areas. Until mid-4957,' thc army had the 4 primary responsibility for internal security,!. and had considerable success. By that time major responsibility for internal security had becn given to thc provincial Civil Guard (48,000) and thc village Self-Defense Corps (47,000). These organizations have proven to be inadequately trained and equipped for thc job, and units from tI.c armed forces have continued to be called in to meet special situa-l lions. Thc sizc and scattered distribution of  the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps add ' to the problems of training and equipping them and of coordinating their activities. In some regions, they arc jin 01 tra ted by Com mu'- I nists. The police services, which include the 1 7,500-man Vietnamese Bureau of Investigation I and l0,500-man police force stationed in thc I main citics, have had considerable success in I tracking down subversives and terrorists and  arc developing into efficient organizations. C. Economic Trends in South Victnam 18. South Victnam has made only limited progress toward basic long-term economic de- . vclopment in thc five years sincc independ-ence. US aid during that period, excluding j military equipment apd training, has totaled over one billion dollars. Thc bulk-of this aid has bcen provided to finance imports of commodities which have bcen sold domesti- . cally. Most of the local currency accruing to the government has been used to support thc armed forces and to finance the resettlement of over 700,000 refugees from thc north. The GVN meets, out of its own limited resources, about one-third of the total civilian-military bvldgct, including about 15 percent of the military budget, The GVN does not have thc necessary additional financial resources to undertake a significant cconomic dcvclopmbnt program. ' Sce Military Annex. S E C R E T 1193 .     , . '- SEC ' I ) 19. Basic cconomic development is also in- hibited by thc GVNs preoccupation with .South Vietnam's problems of internal security and military preparedness, lt continues to regard programs for long-range cconomic growth as of lower priority than thc building n  , of defense strength. Moreover, for politicalI  reasons, it is reluctant to take any measures J which might reduce the countrys relatively I  high standard of living. Consequently, thc I GVN dcvotcs only a small part of available resources to long-range cconomic development J Diem is hopeful, however, that resources for dcvelopmcnt will be provided from external sources, principally thc US and thc Japanese reparations settlement. There is little prospect for private foreign investment, primarily because 'of the unsettled security situation, uncertainty regarding GVN cconomic policy, and other factors creating an unattractive economic climate20. Another aspect of thc cconomic situation has political as well as cconomic ramifications. ' A considcrablc amount of US aid is in thc form i of grants of dollars which are used to import commodities. This practice has tended to inhibit the development of local consumer goods ; industries, although steps are now being taken I to encourage domestic industries. It has sup-i ported a standard of living higher than thc i country could maintain on its own resources. If A significant cutback in thc standard of living j would probably create serious political prob.  '.Terns for the. government.

' 21. Nevertheless, South Victnam is making some cconomic progress. The heavily damaged transportation network is bcing repaired. After an initial period of frustration and delay, considcrablc progress is being made in a modest agrarian reform program. In addition, almost 100,000 persons from crowded j urban and coastal areas havc bcen relocated , on land development projects in thc Mekong delta area and in the sparsely populated central highlands. Thc cconomic viability of" these last mentioned projects has not yct becn RET ' ' 5 proved. Thc resettlement of refugees from thc north is about completed. Rice production is approaching 1939 Icvcls, but increased domestic, consumption has kept rice exports far below prewar levels. Rubber has surpassed 1939 Icvcls and has replaced rice as thc nations major export. > 22. Some constructive long-rangc measures are bcing taken. The GVN is attempting to increase internal revenues by strengthening its tax systcm and is trying to restrict domes" tic consumption and total imports to about present amounts. If the main part of the defense burden i.s carried by thc US, it is probable that over the next few years the steps taken and planned by thc GVN will enable domestic production to expand and thus reduce thc balance of payments deficit on goods and services, which was about $190 million in 1958. The planned development of manufacturing would make possible over the next five years the lowering of import requirc-ments by about $25 million a year. In the same period thc trade gap should narrow by another $30 to $40 million if land dcvelopmcnt and rice productivity programs produce the . planned results. Even if those results are achieved, hqwevcr, South Vietnam will still havc large foreign trade and internal budget deficits and continuc to depend upon US aid. D. SouJh Vietnam's Foreign Relations  23. South Vietnams foreign policy is based b upon fear of and rigid opposition to communism, ar.il upon a conscious dependence on. the US as its major source of assistance and protection and as its principal in rnational sponsor. Thc GVN leaders dcsirc to maintain and to assert thcir nations independence, which they believe to be endangered most di-rcctly by the activities and milita , strength of North Victnam. They are also concerned over what they consider the weakness and pro-Chincse Communist orientation of Cambodia, and the machinations of the French.. 24. DRV In responding to persistent DRV bids to "regularize" relations, GVN policy is to impose conditions it is sure will be un-acccptablc. By this means thc GVN socks to improve its propaganda position, while main- SECRET 1194 .   NND 63316,  6 . S E C R E T ( I t L r taining intact its opposition to closer contact with thc DRV. Although thc GVN may agree to limited discussions with DRV rcprc.'J?ntat tives, such as the proposed negotiation' re-garding administrative problems of thc De-militarizcd Zone, it is not likely to enter into any broader discussions (whether or not hcld under the auspiccs of thc International Control Commission (ICC)), and even less likely to agree to the establishment ofreguiar officiaI contacts with thc north. 25. Cambodia ReIations between the GVN and Cambodia havc become acutely strained. Diem is convinced that Cambodias Prince Sihanouk is untrustworthy and is tolerating, if not supporting, anti-GVN operations on thc Cambodian border area by both Communists and non-Cominunists. The GVN leaders havc little confidence in the ability of Cambodia to resist Communist pressures .and they fire convinced that Cambodias recent recognition of Communist China shows that there is little will to resist. The GVN is fcirful of a Communist takeover in Cambodia which would provide a base for subversive operations or at-tack. GVN leaders were closely involved in reccnt anti-Sihanouk plots, and probably will continue activities designed to stir up anti-Sihanouk fceling both inside and outside of Cambodia and to lead to Sihanouks downfall. 2G. Laos South Vietnams relations with Laos are on a generally friendly basis, especially since thc Lap Government has indicated greater awareness of the Communist threat and has- become more outspokenly pro-West in its foreign policy statements. The GVN has undertaken to advise thc Lao Government on an anti-Communist program, has offered to train some Lao troops, and in other ways is seeking to stiffen the anti-Communist posi-tion of the Lao Government. However, GVN worries havc been only partially relieved by recent Lao Government measures to check Lao Communist political activity; the GVN continues to feci considerable disquiet because of North Vietnamese pressures along the DRV-Laos border. 27. France The GVN leaders continuc to sus-pect the French of intriguing to overthrow thc Diem government and to increase their indu- once in South Victnam. French businessmen and officials in South Vietnam arc carefully watched and thc scopc of French commercial, cultural, and educational activities is rc-stricted. .The GVN leaders also believe that the French are at Icast partially to blame for Cambodias apparent drift towards Communist China and for (he failurc of recent anti-Sihanouk plots. Although many South Viet namese leaders havc France, GVN-Frcnch remain cool. a cultural affinity for relations arc likely to 28. VS Although we do not expect thc present close GVN-US relationship to bc undcr-mined, the GVNs sensitivity to its dependence on thc US is likely to grow and to complicate our dealings with it. I Nhu and some other leaders have expressed resentment at what they consider US attempts to dictate to them and to restrict their freedom of action at home and abroad. Diem has indicated that South Victnam expects the maintenance of large US aid and special consideration from thc US as a reward for its Steadfast support. Failure to receive such spccial consideration could lead Diem to assume a stance of greater independence vis-a-vis the US. However, in light of Dicms strong aversion to the French and in the absence of any acceptable alternative source of support,ihe willalmost certainly avoid jeopardizing basic US-South Vietnam esc ties during the period of this estimate. a E; Outlook for South Vietnam 29. The prospects for continued political sta-bility in South Vic! m depend heavily upon President Dicm iiis ability to maintain firm control of th army and police. Thc re-gimcs efforts to asure internal security and its belief that an authoritarian government is necessary to handle thc countrys problems will result in a continued repression of poten II I I J i. tial opposition elements. This policy of re-  pression will inhibit the growth o' popularity, j of thc regime, and we believe that dissatisfac-tion vHIl grow, particularly among those who (j arc politically conscious.

(NSC 5809) (Approved by tho President April 2, 1958) (Period Covered From May 28, 1958 through August 12, 1959 ) A. Adequacy of U. 5. PoIicy in Mainland Southeast Asia (NSC 5809) . 1. Review of .polioy with respeot to Singapore is recommended on an urgent basis,- in order to provide guidance for the new situation which has developcd in Singapore with the granting of internal self-government and . the victory of the leftist Peoples Action Party on May 30, a development adverse to U. S. and free world interests. If this revision of policy is made, the review of U. S, Policy Toward the Far East (NSC 54295) should be kept in mind. B. Summary Evaluations of Progress made in Accomplishing U. i Cbjcctivcs 2. There has bccn substantial progress toward meeting the objectives of NSC 5809 in most of the mainland countries of Southeast Asia. In Singapore, however, left-wing political elements won an overwhelming electoral . victory. Friction between. Cambodia and its pro-U. S. neighbors adversely affected Cambodias relations with the U. 3. for some months but subsequently there was noticeable improvement. There Has been an increased awareness of the communist threat. This increase was given new impetus by recent events in Tibet. Thc resolution of all governments in the area, except thosc in Singapore and Cambodia, to take a firm linc in response to this threat was reflected in the political developments dcscribed below. United States political, CConomic, information and military assistance programs havc played a significant part in thcsc developments, Regional cooperation in Southeast Asia has improved as a result not only of our own efforts to promote political and economic cooperation ad to reduce specific areas of discord, but also becausc of increased Asian aware- ' ncss of the Sino-Soviet threat and of thc material benefits possible from .regional development. This favorable trend has bccn facilitated by thc fact that the Southeast'Asian leaders feel ablc to work with.one another due to similarities in governmental practice and political philosophy. Aggressive Chinese Communist policies in Tibet and elsewhere in Asia have givcn them a sense of urgency to draw together regionally, The United States has . SECRET      ' .

Burma. There has becn substantial progress toward thc achieve- ment of United States objectives in Burma. The government of Prime Minister,Ne Win hets introduced stability and vigor into thc conduct of Burmas domcstic and international policy. The United States has encouraged the new Burmese Government to coopcrate with the Vcst and has made available substantial military assistance. The Burmese security forces have effec-. tively used U. S. equipment against insurgent elements within the country. At thc same time, thc insurgents' relations with communist political organizations have been impaired by the arrest of communist political leaders .engaged in liaison. Communist influence in labor, among the students and in thc press has becn substantially reduced, The governments information cervices have evidcnccd grcater willingness to cooperate with the United Statcs Information Agency and other United States services in psychological < warfare against the insurgents and in general public indoctrination, ' . .-x .. In its international policy, thc No Win Government has made it I J clear that, although it may maintain an overt posture of neutrality bccausc of its geographical position, it considers itself, in fact, idcologically aligned with thc West and looks to the United Statcs for support and leadership in many fields. The Prime Minister has privately stated that he believes SEATO plays an important and useful role, and, while noting continuing Burmese c sensitivity to open identification vith the western powers, hc hopes is move Burma gradually toward a public posture of closer identification wit . SEATO. ' Relationships between the United Statcs and Burma arc -orc cordial than . they have ever been. At Burmese request, thc United States has agreed to contribute substantially to the construction of a highway and university facilities as evidence of United States interest. By contrast, Burmese relations with the Sov.cts have deteriorated sharply. Burma is curtailing its trade and aid relationships vith the USSR and thc press has been severely critical of Sovict Embassy conduct. In its relations with Communist China, -Burma has moved much more Cautiously but is stiffening its attitude toward the Pciping Government, particularly in thc matter of a border settlement. 4. Cambodia. A resurgence of severe tension in relations between A Cambodia and its neighbors, particularly Viet-Nam, resulting from Cam- 'bodian conviction of Thai and Vietnamese involvement in two abortive anti- Sihanouk plots, threatened seriously to frustrate United States objectives in Cambodia during the early months of 1959. Primarily because of our close association with thc anti-Communi st governments of Thailand and ; SECRET ' ;  1237 "      . ' . ' ' ' SECRET 1  . Viet-Nam, thc Cambodians also harbored strong suspicions of United States .omplicity in the coup plots and anti-American sentiment reached alarming proportions in February and March. .Thc Communists profited from the situation by actively idcntifying themselves vith the Cambodian side in thc dispute and by thc fact that preoccupation with opposition movements sup- V portcd by Thailand and Viet-Nam further distracted Cambodian attention 1 from the threat of internal communist subversion. Communist influence V in public information media' continued to grow, although there is recent evi- , dencc of official alarm and attempts to right the balance in favor of a more strictly "neutral" newe presentation. Repeated United States disclaimers of support for anti-Sihanouk activities, sympathetic United States responses to two messages from Prince Sihanouk, visits to Phnom Penh by high . American officials and Cambodian fear of alicnating thc U.S., havc recently improved relations. At the same time, continuation of our economic and ' military aid programs during tile pcriod of stress probably had a favorable effect on the Cambodian Government. In this context, relations between French and U.S. officials in Cambodia havc improved resulting in better cooperation in our mutual efforts to furthcr frce world objectives. No . furthcr significant moves vere made by Cambodia toward the Sb '-Soviet bloc. f Relations vith Thailand became more cordial and the deterioration in Cam- ' ' bodian relations with Viet-Nam was halted. These developments followed 1 by elimination of anti-Western persons from the cabinet, point to a pro-West oscillation in Cambodias orientation. ;  . 5. Laos. Progress has bccn made in furthering United Statcs objcc- fives in Laos, particularly vith refcrcnce to thc strengthening of Lao political. leadcrship, the improvement of Lao relations with other Southeast Asian . countries, and in providing for thc training of thc Lao National-Army. Since . i the grant of spccial powers in January to a new cabinct, there are indications ' that the prestige and morale of the Communist N.co Lao Hak Xat havc de- . teriorated, while those of the non-communists havc improved. Stresses cind strains continue between the older conservative lcadcrs in the Lao Horn . Lao and the younger elements, in the Committee for the Defense of Nation' Interests although both groups continued to participate in the govcrnrncnt and rccently heave evidenced greater willingness to coopcrate in the face of thc NLEIX threat. For the first time since Laos became independent, the Lao Government has recently bccn in a position to consider thc long term prob lcm of developing the rural areas. For instance, through the rural aid program, means have bcen made available to provincial administrators to ' help villagers carry cut email but important development projects. Resumption of communist guerrilla activities in July may reVeal communist recognition of their inability' to make progress by "soft" tactics in the face of thc improving Loo Government position. However, thc military situation C ' remains unclcar and there is no conclusive evidence as to the exact composition, .     . SECRET . seize and objcctives of the attacking forocs. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that thc attacks wore at least supported by the North Vietnamese Communists and that their minimum objective is thc reactivation of the International Control Commission. Visits by thc Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Thailand havc served to improve the good relations of Laos with those countries and may pave the way for increased cooperation with Thailand and Viet-Nam. Strong British support of thc Lao Governments opposition to communist efforts to reactivate the International Control Commission was another encouraging devclopmentAlthough the Lao Government appears to have handled the insub- ordination of thc former Pathet Lao battalion at Xieng Khouang in a moderate g xnanucr, this cpisodc givcs cause for concern on two grounds first, the Lao Army displayed a disappointing lack of capacity to control a small scale internal security problem when it permitted thc battalion to escapc; ' seCond, communist bloc threats relating to this episode raised the possibility that the blod may bo planning either an accelerated subvcrsivc effort in support.of the Neo Lao Hak Xat or a more serious move in Southeast Asia, .

Thc reform has been successful in virtually eliminating previously vzide spread financial and commerCial abuses and in essentially holding the linc on inflation.

We believe that the Communist re-  sumption of guerrilla warfare in Laos was primarily a reaction to a stronger anti- Communist posture by the Laotian Government and to recent US initiatives in support of Laos. We consider that it was undertaken mainly to protect the Com-munist apparatus in Laos and to improve i Communist prospects for gaining control 1 of the country. (Paras. 7-8') 2. The Communists probably believed (a) that guerrilla warfare offered some prospectsat low riskof promoting Communist objectives in Laos even if the Laotian Gen cmment received substantial moral and material support from the out-side, and (b) that military forces which thc West would be likely to commit inside Laos would be indecisiwe against the flexible Communist guerrilla tactics. (Para. 18) 3. We estimate that the Communists in-tend to keep the risks and the costs of , their action on a low level and they are ' not likely in the near future to resort to large-scale guerrilla activity, at least so long as the UN fact-finding mission is in Laos. (Para. 19) , ' L, SEC Pl -z-rff 4. Most uncommitted and anti-Cominu- nist countries would probably support Western intervention in Laos if they were convinced that the Lactian GoVern-ments position was grave and that there was direct Communist Bloc support of the Laotian rebels. In that event, they would prefer that such action be taken under UN auspices. (Paras. 24-26) 5. Hanoi and Peiping have warned that any foreign military intervention in Laos would be considered as a direct threat to ' their national security. However, de-pending partly on the scale and nature of the military move, the Communist mili-tary reaction to the Western interven-tion, whether under UN, SEATO, or US auspices, initially would probably take the form of further covert North Vietnamese intervention rather than overt invasion. There probably would be less effort than at present io camouflage this intervention. This Communist action might, in the first instance, be limited to seizing substantial territory in Laos such as Sam Neua and Phong Saly prov-inceswhich we believe they could do under existing conditions with an aug- .     mentation of present guerrilla forces, and then using this situation for political bargaining purposes. The Comm, mists would probably be prepared to accept a prolonged and unresolved struggle, particularly if the country were geograph-ically divided. If non-Asian forces were committed in Laos, the likelihood of an overt Communist invasion would increase. (Para. 21) 6. If thc Communists should come tO be-lieve that a .Western intervention appeared capable of resolving the conflict and establishing firm anti-Communist control over Laos, they would then face the difficult decision of whether to raise the ante further, possibly to the point of openly committing North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces to the fighting. We estimate that both Communist China and the USSR wish to avcid serious risk of expanding the hostilities more broadly into the Far East or beyond. We believe, therefore, that the Communists would seek through various uses of diplomacy, propaganda, covert action and guerrilla The Director of Intelligence and Research, De-. partmcnt of State; the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army; thc Assistant C.ief of Naval Operations for Inte'li-gence, Department of the Navy; and the Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, would delete this sentence, believing that it oversimplifies the factors which might lead to an overt Com-munist invasion; SECRET  ' ' 2 warfare to cause the West to back down. If, howevcr, the Communists became con-vinced during; the course of a scries of ac-tions and counteractions that the US in-tended to commit major US combat forces into Laos, we believe that thc odds would be better than even that the Communists would directly intervene in strength with North Vietnamese and possibly Chinese Communist military forces.- (Para. 22) The Assistant Chief Gf Staff, Intelligence, USAF believes that thc likelihood of overt interven-tion by Chinese Communist or North Vietnamese forces would be significantly reduced if the Com-muniSts were convinced that thc US would not limit its counteroperations in an expanding con-flict to the territory of Laos. The Director of Intelligence and Research, De-partment of State; the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, DCpartmcnt of the Army; and thc Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for In-tciligencc, Department of thc Navy, believe that thc last sentence of this paragraph overstates somewhat the willingness of North Victnam and Communist China to use major military force against the US in the Laos situation, and there-fore would delete the sentence and substitute the following "If these measures failed, North Vmt-nam, and possibly Communist China, might re-sort to at least a show of military force in a last effort to make these pressures on the Vest elective, and the risks of overt Communist military intervention would thus increase. In the end, . however, the Communists would be unlikely to press such use of force to a point which in their estimation would approach serious risk of large-scale hostilities." Thc Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, would . add thc following clause particularly if they were convinced that the US would not limit its counteropcrations in an expanding conflict to the territory of Laos.

We believe that thc initiation of Communist guerrilla warfare in Laos in mid-July was pri-marily a reaction to a scries of actions by the Royal Lao Government which threatened . -drastically to weaken thc Communist position in.Laos, For a period of about one year after the November 1957 political agreements be-tween thc Laotian Government and the Pathet Lao, the Communist 'controlled party in ' Laosthe Neo Lao Hak Zatattempted to move by legal political competition toward its objective of gaining control of Laos. The Laotian Governhad taken counteraction which chechatl this effort. Moreover, thc US had stepped up its activities to strengthen thc Laotian Government, notably through the de-  cision to send military training teams, and clearly was increasing its presence in Laos. j The Communist advance in Laos was losing impetus. To the Communist world, thc fu-' ture probably appeared to be one of increasing political repression, declining assets, and a strengthened anti-Communist position in tho i country8. Hence we believe that the current crisis was initial cd mainly in order to protect thc Communist apparatus in Laos, to stop the trend towards Laotian alignment with the US, and to improve Communist prospects for gaining control cf the country. Judging by Communist propaganda and diplomatic representations, and by the scale of guerrilla activities to date, it does not appear that the Commu- nists expected by military action to overthrow the Laotian Government and seize control of thc country. They may have believed that the government would be intimidated into immediate concessions, restoring at least a major part of the legal and political position which thc Communists had enjoyed after the 1957 agreements between thc Pathet Lao and ' thc government. We think it more likely, however, that the Communists expected a re-newal o strife in Laos to alarm the world at latfe and to produce a widespread demand for restoration of quiet, and that they hoped thus to bring about through intcrnational action a return of thc Intcrnational Control Commission (ICC; to Laos. Under the ICC thc Communists had enjoyed substantial advan-tagcs, and they probably expected to enjoy them again if thc Commission rcturnod. 9. Whatcvcr their initial aims, the Communists undoubtedly wore prepared to adapt their tactics and their objectives to the developing situation, and even to press on towards an overthrow of thc government and control of thc country if thc prospccts for such ac-tions developed favorably. They may also have in mind, as a feasible intermediate aim,  the re-establishment of Communist control over the provinces of Sam Nona and Phong Saly, and possibly the formation of a rival government in those areas as a springboard for future subversive efforts. 10. The Chinese Communists probably havc ; certain interests in the present crisis in addition to thosc of North Victnam. It is basic to Chincsc Communist policy to oppose vigor-ously' the strengthening of anti-Communist regimes in the area of their interest in Asia and to resist the strengthening of thc US position anywhere otw Chinas periphery. Thc Chincsc Communists probably also wish to demonstrate to Southeast Asian governments, particularly thc neutralist ones, that they can-not turn toward the West without serious risks. Although Peiping may well wish to emphasize its importance on thc world scene and may regard the Laos crisis as useful for th s purpose, this is probably no more than a bonus effect. t 11. So vic t interests in the current crisis in Laos are more remote than those of Peiping and Hanoi. Thc USSR probably views the current actions of Hanoi and of thc Commu-nist guerrillas in Laos as ft reasonable applica-tion of basic Communist revolutionary' doc-trine and in line with worldwide Communist ' interests. It is probably villing to let Peiping and Hanoi work out thc details sb long as the situation docs not appear to risk major hostilities with the West.

Soviet restraint on this question is likcly to continuc at Icast as long as the current high-lcvel East-West dis-cussions are underway( II, PROSPECTS FOR GUERRILLA WARFARE 12. Many conditions in Laos, especially in the northern provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, are favorable for Communist guerrilla warfare. The country is mostly jungle cov- , cred mountains. It is sparsely populated. Most of the people live in small isoIated vil-j lages connected only by foot trails and water-ways, The few roads which do cxist, except those in the immediate vicinity of thc major towns, are little more than jeep trails. Furthermore, the supply routes from Hanoi into Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces and into central Laos are considerably better than those from Vientiane. Air facilities in Laos are limited. The two primary airfields (Seno and Vientiane) have a year-round capability to support medium transports with limited loads. Three secondary airfields (Luang Prabang, Pakse and Xieng Khouang) can support light transport operations on a year-round basis. The remaining airfields are of marginal value, particularly during the rainy season. Communication, facilities are inade- quate even for minimum administrative re- quircmcnts in peacetime. Vientiane has ra-dio communication with the provincial capi-tals and the regional military commands. Most villages, army outposts, and self-defense units must depend upon runners for communication with higher authorities. 13.

'i ns sctial arid rjGlitiCcd situation also of-ers favorable opportunities for Communist guerrilla and psychological warfare. The au- SEC R E T 4 thority of thc Laotian Government has never beep thoroughly cstabIishcd throughout the nation, due in part to thc physical charactcr- . istics of thc country and in part to a general lack of intcrcst by tho ethnic Lao governing elite, which is conccntratcd in Vientiane and Luang Prabang. Pcoplc of Lao stock make up only half of thc population. These con-sidcrations havc inhibited the dcvclopmcnt of a Laotian national spirit, or identification vith thc central government. The common pco-ple of Laos, especially those in the villages, are superstitious and simple folk highly susceptible to rumors, propaganda and intimidation. Communist psychological warfare has bcen at least as effective as armed action in the cur-rent effort. 15. Government authority has bccn especially weak in the northern provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly which were under Pathct Lao control until late 1957. During the lull be-tween the 1957 Laotian Govcrnmont-Palhct Lao agreements on unification and tho re-newal of Communist guerrilla activity in mid-July of this year, the government had made only a beginning in thc process of re-educating thc population of those two provinces away from Communist influences, or away from their traditional trade tics with northern Victnam. This is particularly true among the Kha, Meo and Black Thai tribal groups, whosc mountainous domain straddles -the Laotian-North Vietnamese, border. These tribes, which make up about 50 percent of thc population of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, have traditionally been antagonistic toward the Lao people and government. I' 16. Most of the guerrillas I in the no.ern provinces are ex-Patliet Lao soldiers, ant Meo and Black Thai tribal people. Elements of the Pathet Lao battalion which refused in-tegration and escaped to North Vietnar. are  probably involved. It is almost certain that many of thc guerrillas now .engaged nave re-ceivcd training in North Victnam. that some supplies and equipment for the cutTr. cyra-tions have been provided by North Vemn. and that thc guerrillas move into and out of North Victnam as necessary. Thc total num-berof guerrillas involved up to thc present is RET ' 1245 1 .     SECRET relatively smallprobably 1,500 to 2,000 at. most. Although Lilis may represent thc major portion of guerrillas recently indoctrinated and trained for operations in Laos, thc Com- munists probably havc considcrablc addit ior.nl potential strength. Although wc havc no conclusive evidence of participation by North Vietnamese, we bclicve it is almost certain some are involved in' thc guerrilla activity, particularly in coordination, communication, and advisory roles. Lao rebel capabilities are directly proportional to the amount of assist-ancc provided them by North Vietnam. 17. Wc bclicve that if, under existing conditions, the Communists made a vigorous effort through gucrrilla warfare to seize Sam Neua and-Phong Saly provinces, they could succeed in doing so with an augmentation of present guerrilla forces by additional guerrilla forces and logistic support from outside Laos, and without involving the use of regular North Vietnamese units. Sam Neua town itself, which has special political and psychological importance for the Laotian Government, might be ablc to hold out for a considerable length of time, particularly if loyal troops elsewhere in the province conducted effective gucrrilla action against the Communist guerrillas. However, problems of logistic support and morale, if not corrected, could lead to the fall or surrender of Sam Neua town. Although thc loss of thc two provinces and particularly of Sent Neua town would be a serious blow to the Laotian Govcrnment, we do not believe that it would lead to thc collapse of the governments will to continuc the struggle, particularly if it appeared that effective help would be forthcoming. 18. The considerations discussed in the paragraphs above probably caused thc Communists to believe (a) that gucrrilla warfare offered some prospectsat low riskof promoting Communist objectives in Laos cven if the Lao , Govcrnment received substantial moral and material support from the outside, and (b) that military forces which the West would be likely to commit inside Laos would be indecisive against the flexible Communist guerrilla tactics. 5 I III. REACTIONS TO CERTAIN CONTINGENT DEVELOPMENTS 19. Wc do not believe that thc Communists will resort in thc near future to large-scale gucrrilla activity, such as an attempt to take Sam Neua, at least so long as thc UN fact-finding mission is present in Laos. Thc Communists will make spccial cfEot ts to conceal cvi-dences of outside participation and will probably reaffirm oiTcrs to ncgotiatc political differences with the Laotian Govcrnment. Moreover, the US has already set in motion certain military preparedness measures in thc Far East. It is possible that these or similar moves might.cause thc Communists to keep guerrilla activity in Laos at a low lcvel for a considerable period. 20. If, however, Communist armed action increased in scale and effectiveness, cither in thc near future or at some later; time, and if Laotian appeals for outside assistance did not result in quick and favorable response, it is probable that Laotian morale would rapidly decline and the will to resist would wither away. Such developments would have widespread adverse repercussions throughout neutral and non-Communist elements in. Southeast Asia. 21. Hanoi and Peiping have warned that any1 . foreign military intcrvcntion in Laos would 'be considered as a direct'threat to their national security. However, depending partly on thc scalc and nature, of the military move, thc Communist military reaction to the Western intervention, whether under UN, SEATO, or US auspices, initially would probably take the form of furthcr covert North Vietnamese intervention rather than overt invasion. There probably would bc less effort than at present to camouflage this intervention. This Communist action might, in thc first instance, be limited to seizing substantial territory in Laossuch as Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinceswhich we believe they could do under existing conditions with an augmentation of present guerrilla forces, and then using this situation for political bargaining purposes. Thc Communists would probr.bly be prepared to acctpt a prolonged and unresolved SECRET      SECRET struggle, particularly if thc country were geo-graphieally divided. If non-Asian forces were committed in Laos, thc likelihood of an overt  Communist invasion would increase.1 22. If thc Communists should come to bclicve that a Western intervention appeared capable of resolving the conflict and establishing firm anti-Communist control oyer Laos, thcy would then face thc difficult decision pf whether to raise the ante furthcr, possibly to the point of openly committing North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces to thc fighting. We estimate that both Communist China and thc USSR wish to avoid serious risk of ex-panding the hostilities more broadly in the Far East -or beyond. We believe, therefore, ' that the Communists would seck through various uses of diplomacy, propaganda, covert action and guerrilla warfare to cause thc West to back down. If, however, the Communists became convinced during the course of a series of actions and counteractions that the US in-tended to commit major US combo'll forces into Laos, we believe that the odds would bc better than -even that the Communists would di-rectly intervene in strength vith North Viet-namcse and possibly Chinese Communist mili-tary forces.5 23. Thc Communists would probably counter thc unilateral introduction of volunteers or regular military units from South Victnam and Thailand with the introduction of North Vietnamese "volunteers. Sec footnote to Concusion 5.  See footnotes to Conclusion 6. 24. The uncommitted and anti-Communist countries cf thc world would view with alarm a Communist takeover of Laos, but arc fear-ful that a Western intervention in Laos might lead to the outbreak of a major war. Nevertheless, most of these 1 countries, includimr I most members of SEATO, would probably supP port such intervention if they were convinced of thc gravity of the Lmtian Covernmcnts po-. sition and of direct Communist Bloc support of the rebcls in Laos. Thc findings of the UN Security Council subcommittee will almost ccrtainly have an important influence in this respect. 25. If thc uncommitted and anti-Communist countries accepted thc need for.intervention in Laos, thcy would prefer that such action be taken under UN auspices. If dispatch of a UM-led force were blocked by Communist diplomatic opposition, intervention by SEATO would probably bc supported by most Free World countries despite the strong dislike of some neutralist nations for the SEATO concept. On the other hand, SEATO failure to move effectively in response to a Lao appeal for help would not only endanger the existence of SEATO itseli but would seriously weaken the confidence of the rton-SEATO statcs of Asia in thc Wests determination and ability to dcfend them from Communist attack. 28. US military intervention, such as the dis-patch of troops to Laos, in the absence of broad acceptance of thc need to intervene would' probably have little support even among the anti-Communist nations. Our SEATO allies, however, would probably support us although most might do so with considerable reluctance. SECRET I I I .

' 'the policy vhich pertain to Cambodia and Ln.os, The basis for this recorn- . mendation is as follows ' . 1 ( Cambodia (Paragraphs 39 through 42) . 2, The major difficulty is encountered in the present wording and con- text of paragraph 39. Owing to the evolution of political conditions in ( N . Cambodia over thc past 18 months, this paragraph appears misleading in . that it docs not provide guidance for dealing with Prince Sihanouk and thc political strength he represents, but rather implies that we should encourage non-communist elements whether or not thcy are opposed to Sihanouk. Tho latter has emerged with added power and prestige from the abortive coup plots and subsequent subversive activities mounted against him in 1959 by ostensibly anti-communist elements. In thc process many of these elements were eliminated and the revelation of their real or fancicd assoCiation with the United States and other free world countries undermined Cambodian confidence in U. S. motives and became an obstacle to the pursuit of cur objectives. Moreover, Sihanouk has given further evidence of political astuteness in the domestic arena, has displayed increased alertness to ' communist subversion, and has shown no inclination to tolerate any Challenge, to. his procmincnce. Policy guidance, therefore, should be directed conspicuously and specifically at the problem of dealing with Sihanouk, by ill odds the major single factor in Cambodia and thc principal target of U. S. policy% 3. The other courses of action for Cambodia (paragraphs 40 through 4?.) remain valid, but fail to take into account the particular forms in which certain general problems arc encountered in Cambodia. In revising the NSC paper, conoidcraticn chould be given to the following additional points . '  ' . SECRET      ; SECRET .  ' a, it would seem dcsirable to acknowledge the acute sensitivity I of Cambodians to the U. S. attitude tQward Sihanouks brand of neutrality and to reinforce the general guidance nn this question given as a regional course of action intparagraph 14 by more specific treatment in the country section  i ,,   b. Another problem which probably merits specific attention is the presence francaisc in Cambodia. Guidance on U. S. policy toward thc attempt to maintain French influence in Cambodia, and on the use of this inft.uence in the furtherance of U. S. objectives, would appear desirable. c. Paragraphs 40 and 41, dealing with U. S. aid, probably could be revised to reflect the fact that our military and economic assistance programs in sensitive fields are essentially preclusive in nature and to  prcivide clearer guidance on the use of U, S aid to prevent communist penetrationI ' d. Finally, the. guidance on Cambodias relations with its neighbors might be strengthened to reflect the greater significance this problem has assumed in recent months and consequently the more urgent nccd for the U. S. to exert a moderating influence, . Laos (Paragraphs 43 through 49) -------- .-- .- , . <4, Both the internal political situation and the countrys external relations have evolved considerably since NSC 5809 was approved (April 2, 1958). and thc guidance contained in paragraphs 43 through 49 is not entirely ade- , . quate in the light of operational experience.5, NHre specifically, our problem in the last few months has not becn f "to ntrengthen the determination of the RLG to resist subversion" (P, 43 or "to prevent I no neutrality from veering toward pro-communism" (P. 44). '' Without minimizing the importance of these objectives, our immediate-operational problem has becn to persuade thc Lao leadership from talking too drastic actions which might provoke a reaction on the part of thc North Vietnamese and whidl might alienate free world sympathy for Laos--as for '  , instance, outlawing and eliminating by force the NLHX, or taking a hard anti-. .. communist position in international affairs,' . 6.' Again, the events of the past summer havc strengthened the belief . of thc. Lao in the UN and have satisfied them that SEATO and, more importantly, thc U( S. would come to their assistance in the event of armed conflict with the communist bloc.

SECRET LAOS POLITICAL BACKGROUND 9, Ju April 1958 an electoral campaign was under way in which thc Neo Lao Halt Xat, thc communist-front party, was permitted to participate. The campaign was bcing fought for 21 seats to thc National. Assembly in fulfill-, ment of a provision of thc Political Agreement which had bccn signed between thc Royal Lao Government and the communist dominated Pathet Lao theprevious November. This agreement had also provided for the entry of .' two Pathct Lao leader into thc Cabinet. The Military Agreement, signed at the same time, provided for the integration of two Pathct Lao battalions into thc Lao Army and the demobilization of the balance of the Pathct Lao forces. Ill sum, with communist and fellow-travellers permitted to enter the Cabinct, the administration, the army and thc National Assembly, the fate of Laos . appeared in the spring of 1958 to bo cloudy indeed. Thc results of the. elcc-tions, which were held in May, confirmed our fears. The Neo Lao Hak Xat . and a satellite party won 13 of thc 21 seats at stale, giving clcar evidence of the partys strength and organization. " 10, Since thcn, anti-communist elements have taken a firmer stand toward thc NLHX and a take-over by peaceful .means, which we may pre-cume thc PL anticipated and we ourselves feared, docs not appear to be an immediate possibility, 11, Thc election results gave anti-communist patriotic elements a severe shock and in reaction the two major political parties merged into one (Rally of the Lao People), while a group of young, relatively better educated men in the government, military and business circles organized themselves into a so-called Committee for the Defense of the National Interests (CDNI). The CDNIs stated purpose was to support any Cabinet, political party and Individual who worked in the national, interests. The CDNI was strongly anti communist. 12. In July 1958, the vacillating Souvarma Phottrna, who negotiated with . the Pathct Lao, resigned as Prime Minister and, in August, Phoui Sanahi-kone formed a new Cabinet from which the Pathet Lao were excluded m 1 which comprised representatives from both the Rally and the CDNI pre-sentinr a solid anti-communist front. This Cabinet, which was further strengthened in January 1959 by the inclusion of three senior army offi .rs, .tackled one by one some of the major problems which had becn left pending by previous governments. It carried out monetary x idrnin" istrative shakeup, undertook various village aid and psychological warfaio programs, and consented to have France and tho United States implement a joint training program for its army. 13. In January 1959 tho Prime Minister declared unequivocally bc thc Assembly that thc g overrun ents foreign policy vzan pro-vestern and SECRET    NND 63316,  SECRET nnti-communist and, in February, declared that Laos had satisfied all .. the provisions of thc Genova Agreement, While the government has somewhat gone back on this bold stand and resumed an announced foreign policy of neutrality (with our encouragement), in fact it has continued to oppose the exchange of diplomatic missions with any communist country and at homohas takcn firm meh.ou.rcs to counter and control the Neo Lao Flak Nat. The . progress which thc government was elowly making,- its firmness toward this party, and thc partys consequent lessening prospects of a peaceful take-over, have been conuidcred causes for the events of the past summer. By reverting . to armed subvcrsion, the communists presumably sought to protect their apparatus and recover their influence which had been gradually eroded over several months' 14, The events of this Summer brought world-attention to focus on the situation in Laos. Domestically, they resulted in strengthening tho anti communist, anti-Viet Minh convictions of the Lao leadership. Internationally, thcy brought about the dccision to establish an enlarged UN presence in the country which would permit world opinion to focus rapidly on the situation if new fighting were to break out. At the same time, the Lao gained ?. sence of reassurance that SEATO and, more meaningfully, the U, S. were prepared to stand by their country if it came to a showdown. 15. While it is.not inconceivable that a Cabinet with neutralist ten-dcncics might be created, such an eventuality is far less likely them in April 1958. Major elements of thc Lao leadership arc firmly cornmitted to an anti-communist stand. Therefore, the major problem is no longer one of insuring an anti-communist government but rather one of giving the pro- -western anti-communist elements Cause for maintaining their position encomoging greater cohesion among them and reassuring them that their policies will permit their country to progress. This evaluation is strengthened by the recent political crisis of DcCembcr. 1959-January 1960 which brought about the downfall of Phoui and the creation of a new Cabinet under Ko-Abhay. While Kou has made public declarations of neutrality (in consonance with our recommendations), all the Ministers on whom the Ambassador called have made clear that thcy would continue to look to close coopcvtion with the U. S. Thc Kou Government is charged vith preparing Laos f< r now elections in the nes.r future. SECRET .

Series C Departments Telegram No. 1339, January 29, 1960 DARMY Special Report on Current Internal Security Situation Enclosed is a special report prepared by a Country Team study group on the current internal security situation in Viet-Nam. A summary of this report and an analysis of the main factors in Viet-Nams current serious internal security problem are given below Situation. Internal security, which improved greatly since the nip and tuck period from 1954-56 but which nevertheless has been a steady concern of the GVN over the past few years, has again become its No. 1 problem as a result of intensification of Viet Cong guerrilla and terrorist activities, weaknesses apparent in the GVN security forces and the growth of apathy and considerable dissatisfaction among the rural populace. The situation has grown progressively more disturbing since shortly after the National Assembly elections at the end of August 1959, despite the fact that President DIEM was claiming, up to the end of December, that internal security was continuing to improve. The monthly rate of assassinations rose substantially starting in September, and other signs of increasingly aggressive VC tactics such as ambushes of GVN security forces began to appear about the same time. The full impact of the seriousness of the present situation was brought home by a series of VC incidents in late January and February, particularly an attack on an ARVN regimental post near Tay Ninh, other smaller and less dramatic attacks on security posts elsewhere in the southwest and serious VC depredations in Kien Hoa Province. President Diem and other GVN officials are now showing a reassuring awareness of the gravity of the situation. They have not permitted ;hem-selves to become panic-stricken, and there is no reason to become alarmist if prompt steps are taken to correct the situation. 1254 SECRET-NOFORN .     SECRET-NOFORN Page 2 of 4 Encl No. 2137261 Desp. No. 278 From Saigon VC Intentions and Potential. Indications are growing that the VC are mounting a special campaign aimed at undermining the Diem Government. According to CAS sources, VC armed cadre strength has increased to about 3,000 in the southwest, double the number in September. VC groups now operate in larger strength, and their tactics have changed from attacks on individuals to rather frequent and daring attacks on GVN security forces. A recent CAS report has indicated a VC intention to press general guerrilla warfare in South Viet-Nam in 1960, and indicates the VC are convinced they can mount a coup detat this year. President Diem also told me in late February about the capture of a VC document indicating their intention to step up aggressive attacks all over the country, including Saigon, beginning in the second quarter. These signs indicate that aggressively worded statements emanating from the DRV in 1959 may accurately reflect DRV intentions. In May 1959 the central committee of the Lao Dong Party passed a resolution stating that the struggle for reunification of Viet-Nam should be carried out by all "appropriate means". Subsequently in conversations with western officials, Prime Minister Phara van DONG made statements to the effect that "we will be in Saigon tomorrow" and "we trill drive the Americans into the sea". It is not completely clear why the DRV has chosen this particular time to mount an intensified guerrilla campaign in South Viet-Nam. Several hypotheses have been put forward. The campaign may be part of general Chicom strategy to increase pressure on non-communist countries all along the southern rim of the Asian communist bloc. Several GVN officials, including President Diem, have said that the present DRV tactics may be related to the forthcoming East-west summit meeting, but they do not seem to be clear as to just what this relationship might be. Diem and others have also expressed the view that the DRV is aiming at disruption of the GVNs economic, social and security programs, many of which have been making steady progress while others, like the agroville program, threaten to weaken the VC position if carried out successfully. The DRV may also have been embittered by its failure to interfere successfully with the GVN National Assembly elections last August and resolved, as a result of this failure, to intensify activities in the South. GVN Security and Political weaknesses. At the same time that the DRV guerrilla potential has increased in the South, weaknesses have become more apparent in the GVN security forces. GVN leaders have in recent weeks stressed the need for more anti-guerrilla training of ARVN. The desirability of centralized command in insecure areas and a centralized intelligence service has also SECRET-NOFORN 1255 .          SECRET-NOFORN Page 4 of 4 Encl No. 2137261 Desp.

He has also indicated that he has ordered a slowdown in the construction of agrovilles, apparently in recognition of the indications that the people were being driven too hard to carry out this new program. The Embassys views on these countermeasures of the GVN as well as on certain other actions which should be taken have been expressed in a separate despatch. As the situation develops, the Embassy expects to make additional recommendations. sElbridge Durbrow Elbridge Durbrow Enclosure Special Report on Current Internal Security Situation COPIES POUCHED TO CINCPAC POLAD, PHNOM PENH, VIENTIANE, BANGKOK, HUE DI ST AMD DCM POL-2 SECURITY CSA MAAG ELLSWORTH-MAAG USOM WALTON-USOMPSD ARMATT NAVAT AI RAT USIS FILES-2 SECRET-NOFORN 1257      Page 1 of 18 pages SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 2?8 From Saigon Special Report On Internal Security Situation In Viet-Nam The Viet Cong attack on the Vietnamese Army installation near Tay Ninh on January 26 is a dramatic illustration of the increasingly aggressive tactics of the Viet Cong and of the difficulty the GVN is having in controlling the internal security situation. The audacity of the Viet Cong in conducting the attack, the likelihood of VC infiltration into ARVN, the indications of secret support of the VC by some of the local populace, the successful planning and coordination in carrying out the attack as opposed to apparent failure of ARVN which had been told there might be an attack to be sufficiently alert for such an attack and effectively counter once the attack had been launched, are indications of many of the problems faced by the GVN and discussed in this report. Recent Viet Cong Activity A. General Situation The increase in Viet Cong activity in recent months can be traced back as far as the middle of September when the assassination and kidnapping rate began to rise. It will be recalled that the Government of Viet-Nam intensified its anti-VC measures during the spring of 1959 when it increased its forces engaged in internal security operations. These operations appear to have forced the VC to curtail their activities for a period of several months, regroup, strengthen and reorganize their cadres and establish new bases. The added precautions taken by the GVN during the period prior to and immediately following the August 30 National Assembly elections further suppressed VC activity. The two important exceptions to this relatively static period cf VC operations are the acts of sabotage of farm machinery in May and June (which backfired because of peasant resentment) and the July attack on U.S. Army personnel at the MAAG detachment in Bien Hoa. By September 1959 the VC position was somewhat as follows The VC had failed to cary out their plans to disrupt the National Assembly elections. This failure placed the VC in a position of reasserting themselves in the countryside or facing a gradual decrease of their influence as the GVN improved security and pushed forward its social and economic reforms. Reports reaching CAS indicated that the VC by September had become quite concerned over the possible effects of various GVN programs which were getting underway at that time. The GVN program for regrouping isolated peasants into communities was just beginning, the various youth organizations were becoming active in the villages and the new identity  card program promised to create difficulties for many VC cadres who had been provided with false identity papers. The VC propaganda offensive against these programs, which was already underway during August, was intensified in September and VC harassment and violence SECRET-NOFORN ' 1258     By NWD Dale 2011 Page 2 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon directed against GVN youth groups, project personnel and village officials began to rise. B. Assassinations and Kidnappings The figures presently available indicate that assassinations and kidnappings perpetrated by the VC and other dissidents got off to a slow start in September, 59 The date on which the GVN relaxed its post-election security precautions is not available at the present time, but the VC which committed only 7 assassinations and 4 kidnappings in the first 13 days of September subsequently intensified their activities and by the end of Sep-ternber the total for the month amounted to 22 assassinations and 34 kidnappings, according to evaluated data from various sources. From this point the figures have continued to rise to levels considerably above the average for the past two years. A chart prepared by the Embassy and based as nearly as possible on constant criteria, is included as Annex I to this report. Deaths or persons missing as a result of participation in armed combat are not represented on this chart. Since reports are still incomplete for November and December, the figures for these months are tentative. Although a complete analysis of assassinations and kidnappings is not available at the present time, it has become fairly apparent that since . last summer the VC have added the newly formed GVN youth groups to their list of prime targets which continue to include village officials and NRM cadres. The vast majority of incidents has consistently occurred in the Fifth Military Region with a small number reported in the First and Capital Military Regions. During September and October, the months for which final figures are available, An Xuyen Province topped the list for both assassinations and kidnappings, followed by Kien Giang, Kien Phong and Phong Dinh. Other Provinces in the Fifth Military Region, although far from peaceful, vary considerably from month to month. C. VC Military Type Operations VC activities involving military type operations such as ambushes, clashes and attacks on GVN military and civil posts have intensified in size and vigor over the past few months although, according to available information, the number of such actions increased only slightly through December. Statistics from GVN sources on actions and casualties of both friendly and enemy forces  This figure includes four members of the security forces who may have been killed in action since reports simply state that they were "killed"by the VC. SECRET-NOFORN 1259 .     Page 3 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon for the period July-December 1959 are shown in art attachment. The accuracy and value of the casualty statistics is, however, open to serious question. Comparison of ARVN data with that obtained from the NPSS and the SDC shows frequent discrepancies in casualty figures. The post-election intensification of VC attacks began with the completely successful engagement of two ARVN companies on September 26. The poor performance of ARVN during this operation exposed a number of weaknesses which have been commented upon by many CAS and MAAG sources in the Vietnamese Government. MAAGs evaluation of the factors contributing to ARVN's failure include security leaks, inadequate planning, lack of aggressive leadership, failure to communicate information to other participating units and the failure of supporting units to press forward to engage the VC (they were close enough to hear the sound of gunfire at the time). Another factor of importance illustrated in this ambush was the confidence of the VC in their ability to successfully conduct such operations. This self assurance and aggressiveness appear to be characteristic of many actions taken by the VC since September and have probably contributed to the low state of morale reported in GVN security units by CAS sources. Earlier in 1959 ARVN units were ordered, to conduct operations in Phuoc Thanh Province (VC Resistance Zone "D'). From March 8-19 1959 elements of the 7th Division and a paratroop group conducted an indecisive operation against the VC in this area, mainly because of difficulty in locating the VC. Toward the end of March the elements of the 7th Division were replaced by 3 battalions of the Airborne Group, 2 infantry regiments and other miscellaneous units, to seal off and block in the area. The Vietnamese Air Force employed 5 and later 6 F8F fighter planes to conduct air strikes. These strikes employed rockets, bombs and strafing, but the only-known result was the destruction of a number of VC buildings and huts. As the rainy season approached the emphasis was switched from operations to providing security for road construction and other civil works teams. Some patrolling in search of VC was continued throughout the rainy season, but contacts with the VC were minor and infrequent. By September, Engineer construction troops had reportedly been set to work doing road work, clearing the forests, planting trees and building houses. The 5th Division was the principal unit engaged in the operation and was still in Phuoc Thanh as of late November, searching for VC. The built of the VC had apparently moved on to continue their operations elsewhere. Major incidents in October were the following According to a CAS report an ARVN section (which normally consists of about 45 men) immediately surrendered when attacked by a VC group on October 10 in Kien Pnong Province. ARVN, however, denies the occurrence of this incident. On October 30 a SECRET-NOFORN 1260 .     Page 4 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon group of 80 to 100 VC attacked the Kien An District Office, Kien Giang Province, killing the district chief, a policeman, six CG members and four civilians. Seven civilians were wounded and the VC after releasing about 70 prisomers from the local prison compound carried away 23 weapons and other equipment plus the district payroll, which was apparently the target of the raid. Exact VC casualties are not known, but were estimated to be considerable. According to a senior GVN intelligence officer whose comments were reported by CAS in December, the VC in An Xuyen, Ba Xuyen, Kien Giang, Phong Dinh, An Giang, Kien Phong, Kien Tuong, and Long An Province numbered 2900 about twice the September 1959 figure, divided into groups of 40 to 50 men. This officer expressed the opinion that VC attacks in November on isolated Civil Guard posts and ARVN patrol units in Kien Phong Province present an important change in VC strategy in the southwest and that the VC plan to become increasingly active in early 1960 in an effort to prove to the people that the GVN is unable to cope with the internal security situation. An example of this type of activity is the November 14 VC storming of Phong My Market in Kien Phong Province during which they reportedly set fire to a defense militia post, the information hall, three bridges and a motor-boat of the Kien Phong Security Service. Minister of Information THANH told British Ambassador PARKES on February 22 that the VCs are burning a large number of information halls, and he is very worried by the lack of protection and retaliation. By November and December it had become apparent that the VC were operating in larger groups than those used earlier in the year and that their attacks were well planned and vigorously executed. It seems apparent, moreover, from such large scale operations as took place in late January in the provinces of Kien Hoa, Tay Ninh and Phuoc Long (Dong Xoai incident) that the VC have further increased their activities. Serious incidents are continuing ARVN intelligence reports indicate that approximately twenty VC attacked a boat in Kien Giang Province on February 2 killing 12 Civil Guard and 13 civilians and wounding 11 Civil Guard, 2 other security personnel and 5 civilians and that as of February 7 VC terrorism was continuing in Kien Hoa Province.

From Saigon  , These incidents, plus a relatively minor incident involving a VC attack on ARVN patrol on September 14 some 35 kilometers south of the town of Quang Ngai are significant in that they represent the first such reports received from Central Viet-Nam of this type of violence in many months. VC activity among the Montagnards, particularly propaganda activity, intended to set the Montagnards against the GVN and its programs for economic and social development in Central Viet-Nam has been the subject of reports by CAS and our consulate at Hue. There have also been a number of reports of VC efforts to establish bases and to recruit Montagnards for guerrilla activity. During a visit to Kontum in late January our Consul in Hue found officials rather worried about the security situation. The Chief of Kontums northermost district of Dak Sut said that during a three week period in January, Communists had forced or persuaded three Montagnard villages to withdraw into the mountains, out of reach of GVN administrators. This District Chief said that he and the Kontum Civil Guard Chief both think that the Communists have a major base in the Quang Nam mountains northeast of Dak Gle (the northermost point en route 14), and predicted that communist activities in northern Kontum and southwest Quang Nam provinces would be stepped up in 1960. Our Consul was not permitted to go all the way to Dak . Gle because on January 18 a Civil Guard force patrolling route 14 was fired on by a machine gun on a hilltop between Dak Gle and Dak Rotah. A large scale sweep intended to flush out Viet Cong in the mountains of Quang Ngai Province has been underway since the end of October 1958. According to information obtained by USOM Public Safety Division, eleven companies of the Civil Guard and one battalion of ARVN and two intelligence companies were employed in the initial pacification phase. The operation was reported by mid-January to have entered a second phase, that of securing the support of the local population. The new chief of Quang Ngai Province, Nguyen van TAT, told our Consul in January that additional Civil Guard Posts are being set up in the Montagnard districts of his province and that the Self Defense Corps will be greatly expanded in the Vietnamese sections. Asked about the progress of the sweep, he was non-committal, but he admitted that the security drive "will not be over for a long time". E. DRV Intentions In May 1959, the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party passed a resolution or statement stating that the struggle for reunification would have to be carried out by all "appropriate measures". British observers have taken this to mean measures other than peaceful. SECRET-NOFORN 1263 .     Page 7 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon . "You must remember we will be in Saigon tomorrow, we will be in Saigon tomorrow," these words were spoken by Premier Pham van Dong in a conversation with French Consul Georges-Picot on September 12, 1959. In November, Pham van Dong twice told Canadian Commissioner Erichsen-Brown that "we will drive the Americans into the Sea." DRV General GIAP, however, later saw Erichsen-Brown to "reassure" him that DRV intentions are peaceful. (Erichsen-Brown has been very active in trying to get the ICC to take cognizance of the VC guerrilla activities). kCAS sources have reported a gradual increase of the infiltration of VC cadres and arms from the DRV over the past few months which has increased the VC strength to about 3000 in the Southwest. (Based on available information CAS estimates that the Viet Cong strength in all South Vietnam is presently 3000-5000 men). Many of these new infiltrators, according to a CAS source who is a GVN official, are cadres who were regrouped in the North at the hi me of the Geneva Accords and have had a number of years of intensive military and political training. The principal infiltra- . tion route of VC cadres from the North continues to be through Laos to Cambodia although reports are received of infiltration by sea. A CAS source with similar access reports that some of the cadres arriving in SVN from the North have the mission of establishing a VC headquarters to include a general staff, a political section and a supply section and to effect a large-scale reorganization of VC cadres in the southwestern provinces (Fifth Military Region). According to a CAS report from a Western observer based on his limited personal observation, the Peoples Army of Vietnam (PAVN) has continued to train its units in guerrilla type warfare in addition to training in conventional warfare. In the opinion of this Western observer, the PAVN could at any time undertake a successful campaign against the GVN utilizing the type of guerrilla tactics undertaken so effectively by the Viet Minh against the French in the IndoChina War. Another Western observer, a missionary who resided over thirty years in Vietnam, has also stated that PAVN is in excellent condition to carry on guerrilla warfare. SECRET-NOFORN 1264 .    By NWD Dale 2011 Page 8 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon A recent CAS report (FVS-4249) indicates that the VC are presently planning to augment their forces, particularly in An Xuyen, Kien Giang, Phong Dinh, Kien Phong and Kien Tuong Province and that they will press general guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam during 1960. This guerrilla warfare would be under the flag of the People's Liberation Movement (reports of a number of recent incidents mention the flying of a red flag with a blue star). The VC reportedly estimate that 70% of the people in the rural areas of South Vietnam are either embittered by or indifferent toward the present government. According to this report the VC are convinced they can bring about a coup detat in 1960, and are presently considering three ways to do this (1) to incite the GVN military forces to revolt and to penetrate the new government to steer it into a neutralist policy; (2) to force the GVN to use harsh repressive measures against the people by organizing widespread popular uprisings, thereby laying the foundation for open revolt; (3) to set up popular front provisional governments in the Trans-Bassac area as the general guerrilla warfare mentioned above progresses (the VC estimate that they have sufficient penetrations in or control .over village level administration to make this possible). The alternative which is selected will, according to the source, depend upon VC progress during the first four months of this year. President Diem told the Ambassador and General WILLIAMS in late February about the capture of a document by GVN security forces outlining VC plans to further step up aggressive attacks all over the country, including Saigon. These operations are planned to begin in the second quarter of 1960. (CAS has seen the document and believes it to be authenticsee FVS-4292). Military Factors Affecting the Internal Security Situation GVN internal security operations in 1959 employed an average of 25 ARVN battalions, 44,000 Civil Guards, 43,000 SDC, 6,000 Surete, as well as the Gendermerie, Self Guard Youth Corps and NRM members for which figures are not presently available. This impressive number of personnel has, however, failed to keep VC and dissident activities under control. Numerous high-ranking GVN officials have very recently stressed the necessity of more anti-guerrilla training for the security forces. From a military point of view an outstanding deficiency in the GVN effort has been the governments  See also FVS-422O and FVS-4263. SECRET-NOFORN 1265 .     ' Page 9 f 18SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon inability, or lack of desire, to recognize the following factors (1) It is actively engaged in an internal war and, therefore, must take the measures which this situation entails. (2) There is a great need for a strong central military command with wide powers for the conduct of internal security operations in the unpacifiedareas. (3) There is a need for a capable, well-equipped, well-trained, centrally-controlled Civil Guard to take over from the Military in pacified areas. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the apparent lack of success in the GVN attempts to reduce the internal threat of the VC until now has stemmed from the lack of unity of command in a single operational commander who has the means and the authority to utilize all of the potential in the area of operations without regard to province or regional boundaries and without regard to the existing political subdivision of the area. Unity of command is the most important basic principle of administration lacking here. The Province Chief structure has caused a breakdown of coordination and a fragmentation of command structure which has blocked an effective attack on the internal security problem. The fact that the GVN, though striving to bring its military organization to a high state of training, is constantly plagued by the diversion of an average of 25 battalions to an internal security mission is indicative that a serious internal threat exists. The resulting piecemeal commitment of the armed forces has obviously been generally unsatisfactory because of the lack of a strong central command which could effectively coordinate and control all security functions in the area of operations. (See subsequent "GVN Reactions" section re recent action taken to centralize command in the Fifth Military Region). Political Factors Affecting the Internal Security Situation It is highly unlikely that any final solution can be found to the internal security situation in South Vietnam if the GVN does not enjoy the support and cooperation of the rural population. At the present time indications are that the rural population is generally apathetic towards the Diem Government and there are signs of considerable dissatisfaction and silent opposition. In part this attitude appears to result from widespread fear of the Viet Cong and a belief that the GVN is relatively helpless to protect the rural population from Viet Cong depredations. Unfortunately the longer serious insecurity continues to exist in the countryside despite GVN efforts to control- it, the more serious is the effect on the GVNs prestige. Another effect is a growing belief among the peasants that the Viet Cong-will always be here as long as North Vietnam remains under Communist control and that they must adjust to live'with them. (A realization of the long-range nature of the problem among officials responsible for SECRET-NOFORN 1266      ' Page 10 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 From Saigon Desp No. 278 dealing with it could be an advantage. In Malaya it has taken 11 years to reduce the security situation to the minimum, and it is even more difficult to deal with it in a divided country with long exposed frontiers). There appear to be other reasons contributing to the difficulty experienced by the GVN in attempting to rally the rural population (a) Until recently it was becoming more and more apparent that Diem was not being given accurate information on the internal security and political situation in rural areas. As late as the end of December, 1959, he was telling all callers how much better the internal security situation had become, despite many doubts raised by his listeners. Information was apparently being presented to him by local officials in such a manner as to reflect well upon the officials giving it. The President's trips to the provinces have appeared to be carefully "laid on" by local officials. The President himself cannot be absolved entirely from the blame, however, since his system of personal rule which permits direct appeal from the individual provincial authorities to himself, in a sort of intra-executive check and balance system, serves to further weaken the administrative apparatus. Recently, however, as indicated in the subsequent section on "GVN Reactions," the Vice President and others who are not his usual informers on security matters have spoken frankly with him and he now seems well aware of the situation; (b) Provincial and district authorities exercise almost autonomous control in the areas under their jurisdiction. Too often the personnel holding these positions have been incompetent, having been chosen for reason of party loyalty. Moreover, some have tended to view their jobs as a means to personal advancement or financial gain often  See also FVS-422O and FVS-4228.   The local press from time to time reports incidents of extortion and blackmail by local officials. On December 1 Le Song in an editorial cited "numerous cases of abuse of power committed by village police officials such as extortion of money and bribery." Examples like the following are to be found in various reports in the press and from various CAS and USOM sources On February 13 Tu Do reported that a hamlet chief in Binh Tuong Province had been arrested for posing as a security agent and blackmailing four farmers. A USOM source in July reported that a ' District Chief of Security in Biao had reportedly been removed from his position for extorting sums of money from wealthy residents who were arrested on charges of being Communist sympathizers and had to pay for their release. SECRET-NOFORN 1267      SECRET-NOFORN Page 11 of 18 Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon at the cost of the population under their control. Press editorials have attacked local officials for extorting money from peasants, using torture to wring false confessions from innocent people and conducting themselves in such a manner as to reflect adversely on the prestige of the national government. In addition rumors continue to circulate among the population concerning the alleged nefarious activities of and favoritism shown to members of the Can Lao party, while officials have been largely unable to identify and put out of commission Viet Cong undercover cadres among the population, they have often arrested people on the basis of rumors or of denunciations by people who harbor only personal grudges. Police powers justified on the basis of the needs of internal security have reportedly been misused to extort money not only from the peasants but from land owners, merchants and professional people in the towns. This misuse of police powers and the kind of broad scale arrests on suspicion are weakening the support of the population for the regime. On the other hand, the application of swift, summary justice (such as the Special Military Tribunals were created to hand out) designed to protect the population against the Viet Cong threat, if carefully administered and "advertised" as such, can do much to restore a feeling of security; (c) while the GVN has made an effort to meet the economic and social needs of the rural populations through community development, the construction of schools, hospitals, roads, etc., these projects appear to have enjoyed only a measure of success in creating support.for the government and, in fact, in many instances have resulted in resentment. Basically, the problem appears to be that such projects have been imposed on the people without adequate psychological preparation in terms of the benefits to be gained. Since most of these projects call for sacrifice on the part of the population (in the form of allegedly "volunteer" labor in the case of construction, time away from jobs or school in the case of rural youth groups, leaving homes and lands in the case of regrouping isolated peasants), they are bound to be opposed unless they represent a partnership effort for mutual be efit on the part of the population and the government. (See subsequent section on "GVN Reactions" for indications of Diem's current awareness of this problem). The situation may be summed up in the fact that the government has tended to treat the population with suspicion or to coerce it and has. been rewarded with an attitude of apathy or resentment.  Ensuing section on "GVN Reactions" shows Diem now aware of incompetence and abuse of power by many officials. SECRET-NOFORN 1268 .    By NWD Dale 2011 Page 12 of 18 . SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon The basic factor which has been lacking is a felling of rapport between the government and the population. The people have not identified themselves with the government. There has been a general lack of "a sense of mission" in the building of the country among both the local population and local authorities. In the past at least Diem has contributed to this attitude by his constant admonition to the villagers he talks to on his trips throughout the country that they must work harder, do more for themselves, and not complain. He has made little effort to praise them for what they have accomplished or explain the reasons for the demands he places on the population. He has none of the demagogue in him, but is rather still the mandarin. Now that he realizes the feelings of the people, it is to be hoped that he will show more solicitude for their needs and feelings, but this will not be easy for him to do. Possibly another factor adversely affecting the current attitude of the peasants toward the Government is the decline over recent months in the price of paddy. Since the population in the Southwestern delta is particularly dependent on paddy for its income, it would be a normal political reaction for this development to increase dissatisfaction with the government. GVN Reactions to Current Internal Security Situation President Diem, who had earlier taken the position in conversations with Ambassador Durbrow that the GVN's security operations had broken up many VC camps and forced them to regroup into larger forces, has modified his assessment considerably after the Tay Ninh attack and other recent manifestations of expanded VC activities. Previously indicating that VC reinforcements had come from Cambodia, Diem in his latest conversation with the Ambassador on February 12 stated the VC had been reenforced by well-trained forces from North Vietnam. In his view the recent step-up in VC activities is basically a somewhat desperate attempt to disrupt the progress of South Vietnam. He does not appear to be deeply alarmed, but, on the contrary, feels that with measures he has in mind the situation should greatly improve in a few months. He believes the security forces need more antiguerrilla training, but also thinks more security forces are needed in order to provide better protection for the entire population. He has called for volunteers from military reservists who had long guerri 11 a experience during the Indochina war as well as from ARVN and the Civil Guard, and has indicated that over 1000 have already volunteered. Diem also now shows awareness of many of the political factors which have contributed to the deterioration in internal security. By the end of February in conversations with the Ambassador and SECRET-NOFORN 1269 .     Page 13 of 18 . SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon other foreign officials Diem has become very frank in admitting that many of the civilian administrators have been incompetent and have abused their power. He has added he is removing these and placing competent men in their jobs whose principal duty will be to pay attention to the needs of the population and make every effort to win their confidence. The President has become quite aware of the adverse reaction of the people to indiscriminate use of methods of coercion in carrying out the governments programs in rural areas. He explained to the Ambassador at some length on February 22 the urgent need for civilian officials to explain in detail the reasons for the government's actions in these matters in order that the population will fully understand how they will benefit in the long run. Ngo Dinh NHU, the Presidents brother and political advisor, also told CAS on February 5 that the security forces need more anti-guerrilla training. He added, however, that political measures are the real key to defense against the VC attacks, and mentioned specifically that GVN officials should consider political aspects of a situation and not just concentrate on rapid physical results to please the President. In late January Vice President Nguyen Ngoc THO, according to a CAS report, had a discussion with President Diem in which he pointed out his belief that the reports which the President had been receiving on internal security were incorrect as they underestimated the size of the VC network in South Vietnam. He reportedly reminded the President that he had told him a year and a half ago that the GVN did not have a correct estimate of VC strength and, unless this were obtained, the time would come when the country would be unable to cope with VC subversion. Privately Tho was said to have placed the blame for GVN loss of support among the peasantry on province chiefs whose only activity was to apply police powers strictly. He also was said to have indicated that both Ngo Dinh Nhu and the NRM leaders, through the province chiefs, were resp nsible for providing completely erroneous and optimistic reports about the security situation. In a conversation with Ambassador Durbrow shortly after the Tay Ninh attack Tho expressed concern over the seriousness of the internal security situation, and he also urged more anti-guerrilla training of the GVN security forces. Lieutenant General Le van TY, Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese Army, has also expressed the view that further anti-guerrilla training is required. In addition, according to MAAG, soon after the Tay Ninh attack a meeting was held by the Assistant Secretary of Defense with the Chief of Staff and Corps and Field Commanders at which it was decided to make certain recommendations to the President. These recommendations included adherence to the chain SECRET-NOFORN 1270      I Page 14 of 18 SECRET-NOFORN Encl No. 1 Desp No. 278 From Saigon of command by the Presidency; assignment of commanders to be made on recommendations of the General Staff through the Department of Defense to the President as contrasted with recommendation to the President by civilian and political advisers; clarification and definition of the responsibility and authority between the province chiefs, military regional commanders and local troop commanders; and centralization of control of the various intelligence agencies. Indications have been received that at least some of the ideas which have been expressed by GVN officials are being implemented. President Diem has told Ambassador Durbrow that Colonel Nguyen KHANH, newly designated commander of the Fifth Military Region (the southwestern area where insecurity is the worst), has been given full military powers over the security forces of the area regardless of the prerogatives of the province chiefs. Diem also said that the GVN is extending an earlier plan of appointing military officers as deputy province chiefs responsible for security, and has placed them under the control of the military regional commanderAccording to a CAS report, the Assistant Secretary of State for Defense issued a directive on February 1 ordering concentration on anti-guerrilla training and tactics and enforcement of maximum security at all military posts. Another CAS report states that President Diem, as a result of recent urgings for improvement in relations between the Government and the peasants, has ordered a slowdown in the program of building regroupment centers ("agrovilles"). Secretary of State for the Presidency TRUAN told Ambassador Durbrow on February 17, however, that this program must be continued but perhaps at a slower pace, as there is no way to provide protection to isolated farm houses other than by regrouping such peasants into larger communities. He admitted that the- peasants have the normal human reaction jf disliking being forced to work on the regroupment centers, but he believes that after the centers have been completed they will see the advantages offered. Diem told the Ambassador on February 22 that, while he must continue to create "agrovilles," he is not planning to push too fast until one or two pilot towns are in being so that the peasants can learn for themselves the many advantages of this sort of rural organization. CAS also reported that the NRM recently dispatched special cadres to the provinces to obtain for the President information . on cases of dissatisfaction with high-handed or dictatorial attitudes of local officials. Intelligence committees have also been formed in each province which will report to the President through the Minister of Interior. Diem told the Ambassador he had SECRET-NOFORN 1271 .     SECRET-NOFORN Page Encl Desp From 15 of 18 No. 1 No. 278 Saigon been impressed by the centralized intelligence organization he learned about during his visit to Malaya in mid-February.

UPI(#31, May 5, 1960) The U.S. is doubling its military training staff in South Vietnam and stepping up the training of Vietnamese troops for guerrilla warfare against Communist terrorists. The decision reflects concern about the mounting strength and boldness of Communist bands which are raiding villages and assassinating Vietnamese officials. However, U.S. military and diplomatic officials said the Communist campaign is not a "crisis" and in itself, is not likely to become a major threat to the government of President Ngo Dinh Diem. Guerrilla warfare specialists will be included among about 350 additional American military training officers and men sent to Vietnam. 1278      DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY STAFF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE MESSAGE CONFIDENTIAL AC PARAPHRASE NOT REQUIRED PRIORITY Except prior to Category B encryption Physically remove all internal refs by DTG prior to declassification No unclass ref if DTG is quoted FROM CHMAAG SAIGON VIET-NAM TO OSDISA WASH DC INFO CINCPAC CP H M SMITH HAWAII, JCS WASH DC NR MAGCH-CH 691 2OO7HZ MAY 60 Reference UNCLASS DEF 487183 to CHMAAG Saigon DTG 182O16Z May.

SECRET STATEMENT OF POLICY on ' U. S. POLICY IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA f  .. I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ' . 1. General. Since Mainland Southeast Asia does not represent a unified area, courses of action must generally be determined in the light of widely Varying country situa-, tions. However, bas.ic objectives and main directions of U. S. policy can and should be established on a regional ; basis. 2. Consequences of Communist Domination. The national i security of the United States would be endangered by Communist  domination of Mainland Southeast Asia, whether achieVed by overt aggression, subVersion, or a political and econOmic offensiVc. i ' a. The lose to Communist control of any single free country would encourage tendencies toward accommo- . dation by the rest. j . s b. The loss of the entire area would have a  i ' seriously adverse impact on the U. S. position elsewhere in the Far East, have severe economic consequences for many nations of the Free World, add significant resources ; to the Communist Bloc in rice, rubber, tin end other minerals, and could result in severe economic and political pressures on Japan.and. India for accommodation to 1 the Communist Bloc. The loss of Southeast Asia main- land could thus have farreaching consequences seriously adverse to U. S. security interests. r 3 The Communist Threat a. Qyert Aggression. Although Communist pol cy ndvr emphasizes non-military methods, the danger of overt aggression will remain inherent so long as Communist . China and North Viet Nam continue a basically hoSJ tie j policy supported by substantial military forces.

Section .3.3   By NWD Date 201 Of DO J ixux is only a cease-fire in Viet Nam and sporadic hostilities continue in Laos. The Viet Minh have continued to improve their combat capabilities since the GeneVa Conference of 1954.  b. SubVsPsion. In most countries of Southeast Asia a threat also arises from the existence of extensive local Communist capabilities for all types of subversive activities, ranging up to armed insurrection. Additionally, the large overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia offer a fertile field for subVersion. The weak internal security systems of the Southeast Asian states make them highly Vulnerable to such activities. c. Communist Political and Economic Offensive. At present oVert aggression and, except in the cases of Viet Nam and Laos, militant subVersion are less likely than an intensified campaign of .Communist political, economic and cultural penetration in the area. The- political instability, economic backuardnesS, export problems, and extreme nationalism of these countries proVide many oppertunities for Communist exploitation by trade and economic assistance, conVentional political and diplomatic activity, and extensive infiltration. This offensive now constitutes a threat tO U. S. interests more subtle and more difficult to cope with than other threats. 4. U.fUJRole. The United States is likely to remain . the only major outside source of power to counteract the Russian-Chinese Communist thrust intO Southeast Asia, Thus, the retention of this area in the Free World Will continue to depend on the extent and effectiveness of U. S. support as well as on the lOcal efforts of the countries themselVes, a, Political. The underlying purpose of U. S. assistance in the area is to help the non-Communist countries deVelop more effective political organizations, strengthen their internal administration and enlist greater allegiance in both urban and rural districts. In part, this purpose will be seryecl by programs for military and economic aid dealt with below. In part it vzill require an intensification of present programs for training competent Asian managerial and technical personnel. And, in part, new approaches, bOth governmental and private, will be needed. These should, not concentrate exclusively at the national level, but should include activities designed to strengthen and"Vitalize indigenous traditions and institutions and to hare an impact on village life, rural society, and educational systems. ' NSC 6012 SECRET 483 .     . SECRET 1 Military. Because these countries do not haVe the capability of creating armed forces which could. I effectively resist large-scale external aggression, the United States will'be required to proVide a basic shield against Communist aggression. For the foreseeable j future,. local Will to resist aggression will depend on a (. 1 conviction in Southeast Asia that the United States will j ; continue its support and will maintain striking forcesadequate to counter aggression in Southeast Asia with . thecapabilities described in current baSic national security policy. The combination of such U. S. forces and local will to resist would constitute the best  deterrent against aggression. Should the deterrent fail, this combination would also provide the most effective insurance that, in conjunction with indigenous and allied . forces, the United States could suppress aggression in the area quickly and in a manner and on a scale best calculated tO aVoid the hostilities broadening into ; . general war. c. Economic and Technical. The insistence, throughout most of the area, on economic deVelopment provides the strongest lever for the exertion of influence by the Free World or by the Communist Bloc. Without, increased external help from some source, most of the governments of the area will be unable, even with adequate indigenous effort, to manage the political demand for rapid betterment in the conditions of life and proVide for sound economic deVelopment, Failure to obtain such assistance from the Free World will tend to driVe these countries toward economic dependence 'on the Communist Bloc. The. general preference in Southeast Asia for Western technical and economic assistance gives the United States and the Free World an opportunity to obtain primacy orer Communist efforts in key economic sectors. The outcome . may, howeVer, be strongly influenced by the success with which the Free World can cope with Communist efforts tO exploit the existence of Southeast Asian export problems, particularly those inVolving rice. In -the period ahead, flexibility of U. S. procedure and rapidity of U. S. action will be increasingly important, if effective . advantage is to be taken of unexpected and transient opportunities, 5 The Problem of Regional, Association.

NSC .6012 SECR .     SECRET 6. The Problem of Alignment. To preserve their independence, strengthen their internal stability, and protect themselVes against aggression, some countries in Southeast Asia prefer to join regional security arrangements. Some, however, prefer to aVOid alignment with other nations. The basic objective of both groups is to maintain the inde- pendence of their countries free of outside interference or dictation, and the independence and vitality of both are  J j important to .the United States and to each other. i  i  II. POLICY CONCLUSIONS 7< The national independence of the mainland Southeast Asian states is important to the security interests of the United States. If such independence is to be pre-serVcd, U. S, policies must seek to build sufficient strength in the area at least to identify aggression, suppress subversion, prevent Communist political and economic domination, and assist the non-Communist governments to consolidate their domestic positions. U. S, policy should not depend primarily on the degree and nature of Communist activity at any particular time, but should seek to promote these goals vdthin the limits of the economic capacities of the countries concerned and U. S. resources aVailable for the area, 8.' Where a naticnal determinatiOn t maintain independence and oppose external aggression is sufficiently manifest, the United States should be prepared to proVide military assistance based upon the missions of the forces as indicated, in the "Country Courses of Action" (Part V, below) . 9 In the eVent of aggression against a Southeast Asian state willing to resist, the proVisions of the UN Charter or the SEATO Treaty should be invoked, but the United States should not forgo necessary action in behalf of such a state or states because of the pOssibility that other allies might be loath to participate or to furnish more than token military forces, 10. In the long run, the ability of the non-Communist goVernments tO attain political, economic and social objec- tives will be the dominant factor in defeating the Communist attempts to dominate Southeast Asia. The United States should assist, the non-Communist states of the area, to formulate and execute programs designed to promote conditions of sound development, to demonstrate that they can achieVe growth without reliance on Comniuni.st methods or dependence on the Communist Bloc, and to give their peoples a greater stake in the continued independence of their countries.

The United States should continue to make clear its o.m devotion to the principle, of collectiVe security, its r' . belief that regional security arrangements proVide maximum protection at minimum cost for all, and its expectation that a'countrys decisiOn to participate in such arrangements is based on its own calculation of its "best interests and dees not of itself constitute a claim for increased financial aid.

SECRET SNIE 63.1-60 23 August 19cO SHORT-TERM TRENDS IN SOUTH VIETNAM The Problem To assess political and security problems and probable trends in South Vietnam over the next year or so. CONCLUSIONS 1. Developments within South Vietnam over the past six months indicate a trend adverse to the stability and effectiveness of President Diems government. Criticism of Diem's leadership within urban groups and government circles has been mounting. More immediately important, the Communist Viet Cong, with support and guidance from Hanoi, has markedly increased subversive operations, terrorist activities, and guerrilla warfare. (Paras. 4-13) 2. Although Diem's personal position and that of his government are probably not now in danger, the marked deterioration since January of this year is disturbing. These adverse trends are not irreversible, but if they remain unchecked, they will almost certainly in time cause the collapse of Diems regime, we do not anticipate that this will occur within the period of this estimate. However, if Diem is not able to alter presenttrends and the situation deteriorates substantilly, it is possible during the period of this estimate that the government will lose control over much of the countryside and a political crisis will ensue. (Para. 17) DISCUSSION 3. Since the beginning of 1960, there has been a general decline in the political and security situations in South Vietnam. The Communist Viet Cong 1 has stepped up terrorist activities and guerrilla warfare. 1 The Viet Cong insurgents represent- the paramilitary arm of the North Vietnam Communist Party. The Viet Cong estimated to have in South Vietnam between 3,000 and 5,000 regular armed cadres and about 3,000 irregulars organized as underground troops. Main areas of Viet Cong activity lie south and west of Saigon and along the Cambodian border. North Vietnam furnishes guidance, personnel reinforcements, and logistical support to the insurgents. At the same time, grievances against the government, which have long be n accumulating, have become increasingly urgent and articulate. The Political Situation 4. Discontent with the Diem government has been prevalent for some time among intellectuals and elite circles and, to a lesser extent, in labor and urban business groups. Criticism by these elements focusses on Ngo family rule, especially the roles of the President's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, and Madame Nhu,. the SECRET 1208      2 SECRET pervasive influence of the Can Lao,2 the semi-clandestine apparatus of the regime; Diems virtual one-man rule; and the growing cvi-dence of corruption in high places. In. late April, 18 prominent Vietnamese publicly peti-i tioned Diem to liberalize the regime, expand democracy, grant minimum civil rights, (and) recognizc the opposition in order to let the people speak without fear. This unprece-dented public attack on Diem by a non-Com- munist group may embolden other urban ele- ments to become more vocaL 5. A new and even more important element in the political situation is the growing criti-. cism of Diems leadership within government circles, including the official bureaucracy and military; this criticism has become more intense than at any time since 195G. Since the early put of this year, Vice President Tho, other members of the cabinet, and middle echelon officials have made known their serious concern over Diems handling of the internal security problem and have privately criticized the power and influence exerted by ments) program. As a consequence, Diems government is lacking in positive support among the people in the countryside. 7. Thc members of Diems immediate entourage have attempted, wit.hsome.success,to keep him insulated from unpleasant devclop-ments and trends. However, he has become concerned over the deteriorating internal se-curity situation, although he still tends to dis-count the amount of discontent both in the countryside and among- urban elements. Although hc has taken some steps to meet the internal security problem, he tends to view it almost entirely in military terms. Hc believes that increased military activity against the Viet Cong, along with an expansion of the agroville program, will greatly inmrove internal security. He has been openly con-temptuous of the views of oppositionists in Saigon and regards them as uninformed and dupes of thc Communists. Diem also has failed to take any major steps against corrup-tion and arbitrary conduct on thc part of thc Can Lao organization. Nhu and his entourage. In addition, there is considerable uneasiness concerning the operations and activities of the Can Lao organi- . zation. 6. Although most of the Vietnamese peasants are politically apathetic, they also have their grievances against the government. These include the ineptitude and arrogance of many local and provincial officials, the lack of efTec-tive protection from Viet Cong demands in many parts of the country, the harshness with which many peasants have been forced to contribute their labor to government programs, and the unsettling economic and social effects of the agrovile (government-sponsored settle- The Can Lao organization is based on the cell and cadre system, similar to that of the Kuomin-tangor a Communist party. It is controlled by Diems brothers. Nhu and Can. Can Lao mem-bers are active at virtually every level of Vietnamese political life. One-third of the cabinet members and over half of the National Assembly . deputies probably belong to the Can Lao. The organization also controls tire regime's mass political party, the National Revolutionary Move-ment. It is deeply involved in Vietnamese business affairs and has a program to recruit key officers in the Vietnamese military establishment. The Security Situation 8. Aggravating many of thc governments problems is the active campaign of thc Viet Cong to discredit Diem and weaken thc gov-ernments authority through political subver-siori as well as paramilitary action. The Viet Cong has had some success in exploiting dis-cohtented intellectuals, sowing disaffection among the populace, and disrupting the effec-tive administration of government. This campaign has been well organized and skillfully executed, with the result that Diem has. been confronted not merely with the armed threat of guerrilla operations but with a com-prehensive subversive program. 9. Between mid-!957 and the end of 1959, thc Viet Cong conducted a steady but low key campaign of propaganda, subversion, and terrorism in the South Vietnamese countryside. Since January, there has been a significant increase in the number and size of Viet Cong attacks in several areas, particularly in the southwest. Civilian travel on public roads more than 15 miles outside Sai- gon has become hazardous. Attacking units, I 1 i I T, n f J CsS .     SECRET estimated to number at times in the hundreds, have operated over wider areas than at any time since 1954 and have assaulted Vietnamese .Army installations. Since the beginning of the rainy season in April and the launching of Vietnamese Army counteroperations, Viet Cong operations have abated somewhat but i. terrorist activity, such as assassination and  j Jddnapping of provincial officials and govern-t ment sympathizers, Tias .continued at high > , levels.3 Support from North Vietnam appears  to have increased over thc past several months. I In particular, senior cadres and military sup-r. plies such as communications equipment are believed to be moving south through Laos and I Cambodia and by junk along the eastern coastline. 10. Tre upsurge in Viet Cong activity, accom; panied by a stcppcd up propaganda campaign from Hanoi, probably reflects a recent Communist decision to increase pressures on the South Vietnamese Government. The indications of increasing dissatisfaction with the Diem government have probably encouragedthe Hanoi regime, supported and guided by .thc Chinese Communists, to take stronger action at this time. The Chinese Communists probably regard South Vietnam as a promising area for weakening the US position in Southeast Asia at little cost or risk. From the Chinese point of view, many favorable elc-ments are present a sizable and effective indigenous guerrilla apparatus responsive to Communist control; a government lacking in positive support from its people; and the widely recognized political commitment the US has in Sou .11 Vietnam. 11. In countering the Viet Cong challenge, ! j Diem faces many of the same problems which I  confronted thc French during the Indo-China j f War. Viet Cong guerrilla units have suc-cecded in exploiting their natural advantages of surprise, mobiIity, and initiative. In many of their areas of operations, they have ex- .!n the first five months o' 19G0, 780 government officials and sympathizers were assassinated by insurgents. The total number of assassinations in 1958 was 193 and in 1959, 239. Kidnappings i v thia year through May total 232, as compared .with tin !958 and 344 in !959. ',t . 3 ploitcd the tendency of the largely passive population to accommodate to their presence and thereby avoid reprisals. In some areas of operations, however, they have obtaincd thc active cooperation of the local population. 12. In contrast to the French strategy in thc Indo-China War, however, the Vietnamese Government is attempting not only to control the populated areas and main lines of communications but also to group the peasantry into more defensible units through its agroville program. Special measures in organization and training have been implemented enabling the army to react more quickly and effectively against guerrilla hit-and-run tactics. The civil guard is forming commando units and new stress is being placed on the building of a youth corps, 10,000 strong, for patrol and reconnaissance purposes in the villages and towns. 13. The most efTcctive government measure against the Viet Cong, however, remains (hc active participation of the army, with air force support. Until recently, the armys commitment to internal security operations has been limited by the deployment of major . elements in defense against an overt attack from North Vietnam and by training activities in support of this mission. Some improvement in the armys efl'ectiveness and capabilities can b expected with the increased emphasis on antiguerrilla training, improved organization, and better combat intelIigence. We believe it unlikely, however, that the army will be able to do more than contain thc Viet Cong threat, at least over the short run. ' The Outlook 14. The Viet Cong will probably maintain its pressure on provincial officials and government installations at the present high level, and, with the end of the wet season in October, return to large-scaIc guerrilla actions aimed at nullifying the governments authority in the rural areas. Hanoi, could step up the weight and pace of the Viet Cong activities in South Vietnam. In thc absence of mere cfTcc-tive government measures to protect the neas-ants and to win their positive cooperation, the prospect is for expansion of the areas of Viet, .     SECRET . i 4 Cong control in the countryside, particularly in thc southwestern provinces. 15. Dissatisfaction and discontent with the government will probably continue to rise unless the security situation improves and unless Diem can be brought to reduce thc corruption and excesses of his regime. Although there . have been no popular demonstrations so far, we believe that the possibilities for antiregime ' disturbances are increasing. The Viet Cong will attempt to capture and control major demonstrations that occur. Existing police . and civil guard strength is capable of cona trolling small-scale disorders in major popu-lation centers, but army support would be required if rioting bccame widespread. 16. Tb.t position of the army in the Viet- natnese political scene is not entirely clear. i Thc regime has taken pains to insure that no one army figure could acquire such per-; sonal standing or prestige that he could range i . himself and the army against the government, i However, there is some discontent among offi- cers over Can Lao influence in promotions and assignments, and concern over corruption and nepotism in the army has increased. If un-rest in official circles and urban elements became extreme and attempts were made to organize an antiregime opposition, the attitude of the army would become a vital political factor. But it is not clear what the armys action would be in these circumstances. 17. Although Diems personal position and that of his government are probably not now in danger, the marked deterioration since January of this year is disturbing. Those ad-verse trends are not irreversible, but if they remain unchecked, they will almost certainly in time cause the collapse of Diems regime. We do not anticipate that this will occur within the period of this estimate. However, if Diem is not able to alter present trends and the situation deteriorates substantially, it is possible during the period of this estimate that the government will lose control over much of the countryside and political crisis wiIl ensue.      .

POTENTIALITIES OF VARIOUS GROUPS FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THESE TYPES GIVEN BELOW 1. PEASANTS. VARIOUS FACTORS DISCONTENT EXIST-SUCH AS LACK OF ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST COMMUNIST ATTACKS AND PRESSURES, LOW PRICES PADDY, COMPULSORY LABOR ON AGROVILLES AND OTHER PROJECTS, AND ARBITRARY METHODS OF AUTHORITIES. DIEM HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO TRY ALLEVIATE SOURCES OF DISCONTENT (OUR G-79) BUT IT IS IMPORTANT HE TAKES OTHERS BECAUSE PEASANTRY REPRESENT KEY TO SUCCESS OR FAILURE COMMUNIST GUERRILLA WARFARE IN COUNTRYSIDE AND THUS TO GRADUAL UNDERMINING OF REGIME, HOWEVER, ANY SUDDEN DEMONSTRATION OR COUP AGAINST GVN LIKELY TO CENTER IN SAIGON AND SEEMS IMPROBABLE THAT PEASANTRY IN VIEW JACK ORGANIZATION, TRANSPORT PROBLEMS, ETC. WOULD PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLE THEREIN. 2. COMMUNISTS. WHILE THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT COMMIES HAVE SOME STRENGTH . IN SAIGON. THEY HAVE NOT YET OPENLY SHOWN THEIR HAND IN CITY AND ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY OPERATE THROUGH INFILTRATED, OSTENSIBLY NON-COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS WHICH THEY FULL HELP INSTIGATE TO ACTION. EVEN WITHOUT DEMONSTRATION ATTEMPT BY OTHER GROUPS, THEY MAY ENGAGE IN HIT AND KUN TACTICS OF VIOLENCE IN SAIGON AND IN CASE OF ANY DEMONSTRATION WOULD STEP UP SUCH TACTICS DURING CONFUSION AND WOULD ATTEi-IPT BEHIND SCENES TO MANIPULATE ANY DEMONSTRATION WHICH BEGAN, PARTICULARLY BY TRYING PRO VOICE GVN TO TAKE HARSH MEASURE III REPRESSION. 3. TABOR. TRADE UNIONS ARE PROBABLY BEST ORGANIZED NON-MILITARY GROUP IN VIET-EAM AND POSSESS MOTIVES FOR POLITICAL ACTION. TRAN QUOC SUU, HEAD CVIC, IS ALLIED WITH MINISTER AGRICULTURE LE VAN DONG AGAINST NHU-TU "EH FACTION IN CAT LAO PARTY; EACH GROUP IS ALSO SUPPORTING COMPETING LEADERSHIP IN OTHER MAIN LABOR FEDERATION CSTV. DONG HAS TALKED PRIVATELY ABOUT DEMON- STRATION. SHOULD HIS FACTION DECIDE UPON ONE, LABOR WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE ITS CORE. PROBABLE FACTORS RESTRAINING DOUG ARE FEAR THAT HE WOULD NOT SUCCEED AND THAT COMMUNISTS WOULD EXPLOIT DEMONSTRATION TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. LABOR ALSO HAS ECONOMIC AUD SOCIAL GRIEVANCES WHICH PROVIDE FERTILE GROUND ' FOR OPPOSITION GROUPS OUTSIDE GOWERMENT TO CULTIVATE. TAXI AND MOTOR POUSSE DRIVERS FOR EXAMPLE WHO LIVE HAND TO MOUTH EXISTENCE WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASE Hl PRICE GASOLINE UNTIL GVN QUICKLY PERMITTED FARE RISE.

THIS PROBABLY STIMULATED BY DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND PERHAPS EVEN, IN COUNTER PRODUCTIVE SENSE, BY INTERVENING GVN EFFORTS AT POLITICAL STERILIZATION OF STUDENTS. WHILE HO REASON AT THIS STAGE BELIEVE STUDENTS WOULD INITIATE DEMONSTRATION, PROBABILITY GROWING THAT THEY WOULD JOINT ONE LED BY OPPOSITIONISTS EITHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT. GVN SECURITY OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED OVER GROWING INFLUENCE OF OPPOSITIONIST AND VC PROPAGANDA AS WELL AS ESTABLISHMENT OF VC CELLS AMONG LYCEE STUDENTS. 5. CATHOLIC REFUGEES. DISSATISFACTION WITH REGEIE APPARENTLY EXISTS AMONG SOME CATHOLICS, WHO REPRESENT GREAT BUIK OF THE REFUGEES. PARADOXICALLY, SOME OF THIS STEMS FROM WHAT THEY FEEL IS TOO HEAVILY CATHOLIC LEADERSHIP ' OF REGIEI (WITH POTENTIAL REACTION TO FOLLOW) AND SOME TO REGIME'S FAILURE . TO BRING CATHOLICS PARTICULAR BENEFITS (E.G. SCHOOLS). SOME OF HIERARCHY < ALSO HAS STRONG FRENCH BACKGROUND. CERTAIN ELEMENTS HAVE SPOKEN OF NECESSITY AVOID COMMUNIST TAKEOVER BY CHANGING REGIME AND THERE IS EVIDENCE ' OF CATHOLIC REFUGEES HAVING BEENINVOLVED IN ABORTIVE AUG 19 DEMONSTRATION (FVS-4948). 6. OPPOSITION GROUPS AND SECTS. WHILE SOME STIRRINGS ARE SEEN A'ONG . OPPOSITIONGROUPS, SUCH AS THE DAI VIETS, VN0OD, AND DAN CHU, THESE GROUPS ARE HOT EXPECTED TO DISPLAY SUBSTANTIAL ORGANIZED STRENGTH AUD MORE LIKFLY WILL CONTINUE TO APPEAR ONLY AMONG INTELLECTUAL CLASS. THEY DO, HOWEVER, ARTICULATE THE DISSATISFACTION EXISTING IN OTHER CLASSES. SECTS HAVE GIVEN NO SUBSTANTIAL SIGNS OF REVIVAL OF FORCE EITHER III SAIGON OR ELSEWHERE. 7. POLICE. OF OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE IS STRENGTH AND RELIABILITY LOCAL POLICE AND OTHER FORCES WHICH COULD BE MUSTERED TO MEET DEMONSTRATION. METROPOLITAN.POLICE HUMBER APPROXIMATELY 5,760 BACKED BY APPROXIMATELY 3,000 MeMBERS OF NATIONAL POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE UNDER DIRECT CONTROL OF GENERAL NGUYEN VAN LA.

IT COULD BE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT SUCH ACTION WAS COMMUNIST-INSPIRED NO PROBLEM RE ARMY REACTION WOULD EXIST, BUT AS ALREADY INDICATED COMMUNISTS ARE LIKELY TO ACT DISCREETLY BEHIND SCENES. IF ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST DIEM, PROBABLY ADEQUATE NUMBER OF POLICE AND ARMED FORCES TO PUT IT DOWN WOULD INITIALLY RESPOND TO CALL; IF ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST ENTOURAGE OR REPRESENTED APPEAL FOR ACTION BY GOVERNMENT, PROBLEM OF PUTTING IT DOWN MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT. IN EITHER CASE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT'S SUCH AS REPULSION AT ANY EXTENSIVE SHEDDING OF BLOOD OF NON-COMMUNISTS MIGHT QUICKLY CHANGE ATTITUDE ARMY UNITS INTO ONE UNFAVORABLE TO CONTINUATION REPRESSIVE MEASURES. 9. GENERAL. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PROBLEM IS UNEASY POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE ITSELF, CREATED BY COMBINATION OF CONTINUING VC POLITICAL AND MILITARY GAINS, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF GVN COUNTERACTION AND SELF CORRECTION AND PANICKY TENDENCIES BY SOME ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER DRASTIC MEASURES, EVEN A COUP. TO FORESTALL COMMUNIST TAKEOVER. THIS LATENT EXPLOSIVE FORCE COULD BE TOUCHED OFF BY AN ILL-ADVISED MOVE BY SINCERE OR OPPORTUNISTIC . OPPOSITIONISTS OR BY UNDULY HARSH REPRESSIVE ACTION BY THE GVN. CONCLUSION REAL POSSIBILITY DEMONSTRATIONS IN SAIGON EXISTS. COULD BE INSTIGATED BY DONG-BUU FACTION, ESPECIALLY IF IT DECIDES RISK OVERLOOKING FEAR OF COMMUNIST EXPLOITATION. COULD ALSO BE INSTIGATED BY OPPOSITION ELEMENTS OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT, BUT SEEMS UNLIKELY WOULD BE OF ANY SIZEABLE PROPORTIONS UNLESS HOOKED UP WITH COMMUNIST-INFILTRATED GROUP ESPECIALLY IN LABOR FIELD, ANY DEMONSTRATION MORE LIKELY TO BE INITIALLY LOYAL PROTEST CALLING FOR CHANGES IN POLICIES AND PERSONAL AROUND DIEM BUT COULD DEVELOP INTO ANTI-DIEM RIOT. WHILE INITIAL DEMONSTRATION CAN PROBABLY BE PUT DOWN, LONGER TERM OUTGONE WOULD LIKELY DEPEND UPON ARMY ATTITUDE AND DIEM'S METHOD ON HANDLING CRISIS. IN ANY EVENT VC EXPLOITATION IS LIKELY.

O'DONNELL, REGIONAL DIRECTOR, FAR EAST, ISA FROM Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale, OSOOSD SUBJECT Possible Courses of Action in Vietnam Reference Memo for ASDISA from Secretary Douglas, dated 29 August 1960, subject "Deteriorating Situation in South Vietnam" As noted by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, conditions in Vietnam are deteriorating. The key element in the situation is the activity of the Viet Cong, while criticism of Diem's government in metropolitan areas adds to his problems and interacts with Viet Cong plans, the Viet Cong remains the primary threat to security. To the end of meeting this threat, several proposals are herewith submitted for consideration A. Actions within the authority of DOD (1) The emphasis of the MAAG function should be shifted from purely training and organizational advice in preparation for defense against external aggression to include on-the-spot advice and assistance in the conduct of tactical operations against the Viet Cong. (2) Concomitantly, the MAAG should be staffed to a greater intent with officers skilled in the conduct of counter-guerilla operations and who are capable of operating in the field. This might include Marines for amphibious instruction on Mekong River operations. If the immediate threat is recognized as being Viet Cong, these proposals logically follow as a deemphasis from conventional warfare against a wholesale DRV invasion, while the latter possibility is not discounted, it is felt that Viet Cong operations offer a more immediate and a very deadly threat to Vietnam. (3) Equipment required to support counter-guerrilla operations, including turbo-jet boats for Mekong River patrols, should be furnished on a priority basis. Items required by the Vietnamese in the psychological warfare area (See Appendix A) shoul be given a higher priority within MAP and expeditiously furnished. Advice and training in this field specifically directed against the Viet Cong should be stepped up. SECRET 1307      SECRET (4) Small coast patrol craft should be made available to the Vietnamese Navy for purposes, of restricting coastside supply shipment from North Vietnam to the Viet Cong. (5) In the intelligence area, again the immediate emphasis should be shifted from conventional combat intelligence to counter-guerrilla intelligence training at the battalion level. Further, an attempt should be made through training and material support to strengthen the Vietnamese counter-intelligence effort in order to frustrate the Viet Cong subversive threat. Finally, RF equipment should be furnished so that an effort can be made to locate Viet Cong radio transmitters. B. Recommendations requiring coordinated inter-agency action (1) Strengthen the Civil Guard by making MAAG spaces available for trainers and by provision of small arms and other equipment through MAP supply channels plus utilization of ARVN supply, maintenance, and training facilities. (2) During the emergency, the Civil Guard should be temporarily put under the Ministry of Defense in order to integrate the activities of the ARVN and the Civil Guard. The Ambassadors concern that the Civil Guard will lose all identity as a civil police force, if this action is taken, is invalid, providing a strong US position to the contrary is announced and maintained. (3) Emphasis on civic action type activities by the ARVN should be encouraged and advisory and material assistance in this field furnished through MAAP and ICA channels. (4) The Department of State should reemphasize to the RKG the necessity for according the right of "hot pursuit" to the ARVN in its campaign against the. Viet Cong. Since it is strongly suspected that the Viet Cong maintain their headquarters within Cambodia, and since considerable reinforcements to the Viet Cong come through Cambodia, the US should tell the RKG that we explore .heir inaction in suppressing this activity. The effectiveness of the ARVN sweeps will be largely negated until the ROK takes steps to deny its territory as a sanctuary to the Viet Cong. (5) Most importantly for the purpose of strengthening the morale of the Vietnamese, President Diem should be informed as soon as possible through appropriate channels of the gravity with which the US government views the internal security situation, of our intent to provide material assistance, and of our unswerving support to him in this time of crisis. 1308 SECRET .   NND 63.316.  (6) If a large scale operation against the Viet Cong is under-taken by the Vietnamese, the dispatch of Seventh Fleet vessels and Air Force patrols might be useful in deterring sea reinforce-ments to the Viet Cong. 1 Inclosure Appendix A 1309 .

THIS MESSAGE THEREFORE DEALS WIRH OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RECOMMENDATIONS. I REALIZE SOME MEASURES I AM RECOMMENDING ARE DRASTIC AND WOULD BE MOST IMPOLITIC FOR AN AMBASSADOR TO MAKE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT CONDITIONS HERE ARE BY NO MEANS NORMAL. DIEM GOVERNMENT IS IN QUITE SERIOUS DANGER. THEREFORE, IN MY OPINION PROMPT AND EVEN DRASTIC ACTION IS CALLED FOR. ' I AM WELL AWARE THAT DIEM HAS IN PAST DEMONSTRATED ASTUTE JUDGMENT AND HAS SURVIVED OTHER SERIOUS CRISES. POSSIBLY HIS JUDGMENT WILL PROVE SUPERIOR TO OURS THIS TIME, BUT I BELIEVE NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO GIVE HIM OUR BEST JUDGMENT OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS REQUIRED TO PRESERVE HIS GOVERNMENT. WHILE DIEM OBVIOUSLY RESENTED MY FRANK TALKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WILL PROBABLY RESENT EVEN MORE SUGGESTIONS OUTLINED BELOW, HE HAS APPARENTLY ACTED ON SOME OF OUR EARLIER SUGGESTIONS AND MIGHT ACT ON AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOLLOWING 1. I WOULD PROPOSE HAVE FRANK AND FRIENDLY TALK WITH DIEM AND EXPLAIN OUR SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT PRESENT SITUATION AND HIS POLITICAL POSITION. I WOULD TELL HIM THAT, VIRILE MATTERS I AM RAISING DEAL PRIMARILY WITH INTERNAL AFFAIRS, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO HIM FRANKLY AND TRY TO BE AS HELPFUL AS I CAN BY GIVING HIM THE CONSIDERED JUDGMENT OF MYSELF AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON ON APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ASSIST HIM IN PRESENT SERIOUS SITUATION. (BELIEVE IT BEST NOT INDICATE TALKING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS.) I WOULD PARTICULARLY STRESS DESIRABILITY OF ACTIONS TO BROADEN AND INCREASE HIS POPULAR SUPPORT PRIOR TO 1961 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS REQUIRED BY CONSTITUTION BEFORE END APRIL. I WOULD PROPOSE FOLLOWING ACTIONS TO PRESIDENT 2. PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK EFFECT IS REQUIRED TO TAKE INITIATIVE FROM COMMUNIST PROPAGANDISTS AS WELL AS NON-COMMUNIST OPPOSITIONISTS AND CONVINCE POPULATION GOVERNMENT TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO DEAL WITH PRESENT SITUATION, OTHERWISE WE FEAR MATTERS COULD GET OUT OF HAND. TO ACHIEVE THAT EFFECT FOLLOWING SUGGESTED (A) BECAUSE OF SECRET 1312 .     SECRET -3- 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 IM (SECTION ONE OF TWO) FROM SAIGON (A) BECAUSE OF VICE PRESIDENT THO'S KNOWLEDGE OF SOUTH WHERE COMMUNIST GUERRILLA INFILTRATION IS SPREADING SO RAPIDLY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE BE SHIFTED FROM MINISTRY NATIONAL ECONOMY TO MINISTRY INTERIOR. (DIEM HAS ALREADY MADE THIS SUGGESTION BUT VICE PRESIDENT MOST RELUCTANT TAKE JOB.) (B) IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMOVE ANY FEELING WITHIN ARMED FORCES THAT FAVORITISM AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS MOTIVATE PROMOTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS. ALSO VITAL IN ORDER DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH VIET-CONG THREAT THAT CHANNELS OR COMMAND BE FOLLOWED BOTH DOWN AND UP. TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT THESE CHANGES IN ARMED FORCES, I WOULD SUGGEST APPOINTMENT OF FULL-TIME MINISTER NATIONAL DEFENSE. (THUAN HAS INDICATED DIEM HAS BEEN THINKING OF GIVING THUAN DEFENSE JOB.) (C) RUMORS ABOUT MR. AND MRS. NHU ARE CREATING GROWING DISSENSION WITHIN COUNTRY AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGE POLITICAL POSITION OF DIEM GOVERNMENT. WHETHER RUMORS TRUE OR FALSE, POLITICALLY IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BELIEVE THEM TO BE TRUE. THEREFORE, BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT IN INTEREST DIEM GOVERNMENT SOME ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. IN ANALAGOUS SITUATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING US IMPORTANT, USEFUL GOVERNMENT PERSONALITIES HAVE HAD TO BE SACRIFICED FOR POLITICAL REASONS. I WOULD SUGGEST THEREFORE THAT PRESIDENT MIGHT APPOINT NHU TO AMBASSADORSHIP ABROAD. (D) SIMILARLY TRAN KIM TUYEN, NHU'S HENCHMAN AND HEAD OF SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, SHOULD BE SENT ABROAD IN DIPLOMATIC CAPACITY BECAUSE OF HIS GROWING IDENTIFICATION IN PUBLIC MIND WITH ALLEGED SECRET POLICE METHODS OF REPRESSION AND DURBROW SECRET 1313           -2 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 PM (SECTION TWO OF TWO) FROM SAIGON 6. RELAX EXISTING MINISTRY OF INFORMATION CONTROL OVER COGENT OF THE VIETNAMESE PUBLIC MEDIA (PRESS,MAGAZINES, RADIO), SO THAT THEY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WIDER DISSEMINATION OF FACTS TO DISPEL RUMORS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO RECOMMENDATIONS 4 AND 5 ABOVE, AND THUS TO CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND ITS PEOPLE BY TRANSMITTING IDEAS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. TO INSURE THAT THE PRESS WOULD REFLECT, AS WELL AS LEAD, PUBLIC OPINION WITHOUT BECOMING A MEANS OF UPSETTING THE ENTIRE GVN STRUCTURE, IT SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO A SELFIMPOSED CODE OF ETHICS OR "CANON" OF PRESS-CONDUCT. 7. LAUNCH MAJOR PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ABOUT NEVI 3-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN IN EFFORT CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT GOVERNMENT GENUINELY AIMS AT IMPROVING THEIR WELFARE. (THIS SUGGESTION DEPENDENT OF COURSE UPON ASSESSMENT OF SOUNDNESS OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN, WHICH HAS JUST REACHED US.) 8. ADOPT FOLLOWING MEASURES FOR IMMEDIATE ENHANCEMENT OF PEASANT SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT (A) ESTABLISH MECHANISM FOR INCREASING PRICE PEASANT WILL RECEIVE FOR PADDY CROP BEGINNING TO COME ON MARKET IN DECEMBER, EITHER BY DIRECT SUBSIDIZATION OR ESTABLISHMENT STATE PURCHASING MECHANISM; (B) INSTITUTE MODEST PAYMENT FOR ALL CORVEE LABOR (C) SUBSIDIZE AGROVILLE FAMILIES ALONG SAME LINES AS LAND RESETTLEMENT FAMILIES UNTIL FORMER ON FEET ECONOMICALLY; (D) INCREASE COMPENSATION PAID TO YOUTH CORPS. IF DIEM ASKS HCW THESE MEASURES ARE TO BE FINANCED I SHALL SUGGEST THROUGH INCREASED TAXES OR INCREASED DEFICIT FINANCING, AND SHALL NOTE THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES REASONABLE DEFICIT FINANCING BECOMES A POLITICALLY NECESSARY MEASURE FOR GOVERNMENTS. I SHOULD ADD THAT USING REVENUES FOR THESE FUNDAMENTAL AND WORTHY PURPOSES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SPENDING LARGER AND LARGER SUMS ON SECURITY FORCES, WHICH, WHILE THEY ARE ESSENTIAL AND SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXISTING SECURITY FORCES FAY BE REQUIRED, ARE NOT COMPLETE ANSWER TO CURRENT PROBLEMS. 9. PROPOSE SUGGEST TO DIEM THAT APPROPORIATE STEPS OUTLINED ABOVE BE ANNOUNCED DRAMATICALLY IN HIS ANNUAL STATE OF UNION MESSAGE TO 1315 .     ' '  -3- 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 Ri (SECTION TWO OF TWO) FROM SAIGON MESSAGE TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN EARLY OCTOBER. SINCE DIEM USUALLY DELIVERS MESSAGE IN PERSON THIS WOULD HAVE MAXIMUM EFFECT, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IT BE BROADCAST LIVE TO COUNTRY. 10. AT SOME STAGE, PERHAPS ON OCCASION FIFTH ANNIVERSARY ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ON OCTOBER 26, IT FAY BECOME HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR PRESIDENT EISENHOWER TO ADDRESS A LETTER OF CONTINUED US SUPPORT TO DIEM. DIEM HAS UNDOUBTEDLY NOTICED THAT EISENHOWER LETTER RECENTLY DELIVERED TO SINANOUK. NOT ONLY FOR THIS REASON BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GIVE DIEM CONTINUED REASSURANCE OF OUR SUPPORT, PRESIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH COULD BE PUBLISHED HERE MAY PROVE TO BE VERY VALUABLEREQUEST ANY ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS DEPARTMENT MAY HAVE AND ITS APPROVAL FOR APPROACH TO DIEM ALONG LINES PARAS 1 TO 9. WE BELIEVE US SHOULD AT THIS TIME SUPPORT DIEM AS BEST AVAILABLE VIETNAMESE LEADER, BUT SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT OVERRIDING US OBJECTIVE IS STRONGLY ANTI-COMMUNIST VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN COMMAND LOYAL AND ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF WIDEST POSSIBLE SEGMENTS OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, AND IS ABLE TO CARRY ON EFFECTIVE FIGHT AGAINST COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS. IF DIEM'S POSITION IN COUNTRY CONTINUES DETERIORATE AS RESULT FAILURE ADOPT PROPER POLITICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SECURITY MEASURES, IT MAY BECOME NECESSARY FOR US GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN CONSIDERATION ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTION AND LEADERS IN ORDER ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVE.

SECRETLIMIT DISTRIBUTION Page 1 Enclosure 1 Despatch 157 From Saigon ENGLISH TEXT OF MEMORANDUM HANDED TO PRESIDENT DIEM Mr. President, in your struggle for survival against the Viet Cong, you have taken many wise steps with respect to the security forces of the Goverment, and I understand that you are in the process of setting up a national Internal Security Council and a centralized intelligence agency as important and necessary additional steps toward giving effective guidance to and making maximum use of the security forces, we have recognized the increased security threat to your Government and the additional needs of your security forces, we have shown this recognition by the comprehensive program for training, equipping and arming the Civil Guard which I have just explained, by our furnishing special forces personnel for the anti-guerrilla training of ARVN and by supplying the special equipment needs of ARVN for the war against the guerrillas. Our serious concern about the present situation is based, however, not only on the security threat posed by the Viet Cong, but also on what to us seems to ' be a decline in the popular political support of your Government brought on in part, of course, by Viet Cong intimidation. As your friend and supporter, Mr. President, I would like to have a frank and friendly talk with you on what seems to be the serious political situation confronting your Government. While I am aware that the matters I am raising deal primarily with internal affairs and, therefore, in ordinary circumstances would be no concern of mine, I would like to be as helpful as I can by giving you the considered judgment of myself and some of my friends and your friends in washington on what we hope would be appropriate measures to assist you in this present crucial situation. i I believe that your speech to the National Assembly on October 3, in which you stated that your Government has decided to reorganize certain of its institutions and to rationalize and simplify its working methods, indicates that we may be thinking to some extent at least along the same lines. I would like particularly to stress the desirability of actions to broaden and increase your popular support prior to the 1961 Presidential elections. It would seem to me that some sort of a psychological shock effect would be helpful in order to take the initiative from the Communist propagandists as v .11 as the non-Communist oppositionists, and to convince the population that your Government is taking effective political as well as security measures to deal with the present situation. It would appear that, unless fully effective steps are taken to reverse the present adverse political trend, your Government will face an increasingly difficult internal security situation. -It is our carefully consider view that small or gradual moves are not adequate. To attain the desired effect, moves, major in scope and with extensive popular appeal, should be taken at once. Specific actions which we would suggest are as follows SECRETLIMIT DISTRIBUTION 1318 .     SECRETLIMIT DISTRIBUTION Page 2 Enclosure 1 . Despatch 157 From Saigon (1) we suggest that you consider Cabinet changes as a necessary part of the effective moves needed to build up popular interest and support. One Cabinet change -that we believe would be helpful would be the appointment of a full-time Minister of National Defense in order to permit you to devote your attention to developing over-all policies. To achieve maximum benefit it is suggested that you issue firm directives to assure that there is adherence to channels of command both up and down and that firm action be taken to eliminate any feeling that favoritism and political considerations enter into the promotion and assignment of personnel in the armed forces. Removal of this latter feeling is of great importance if the morale of the armed forces is not to be adversely affected during their mortal struggle against the Viet Cong. we suggest that one or two members of the non-Communist opposition be given Cabinet posts in order to demonstrate to the people your desire for the establishment of national unity in the fight against the Viet Cong, and to weaken the criticisms of the opposition which have attracted considerable attention both in Saigon and abroad. (2) In rationalizing and simplifying the Government's methods of work, we suggest you seek to find new methods to encourage your Cabinet Members to assume more responsibility rather than frequently submitting relatively minor matters to the Presidency for decision, thus allowing you more time to deal with basic policy matters; that the new national Internal Security Council be so constituted as to be the top level policy-making institution by having it meet frequently under your chairmanship for full discussion of all the major problems confronting the Government and proposed solutions thereto; and that of authority from you in direct line to the department and agency heads properly concerned. Under this system Cabinet Ministers and agency heads can be held fully responsible for the operation of their departments and agencies, because of the full authority you have bestowed upon them. If a Cabinet Minister cannot fulfill his responsibilities under this system, we would then suggest that you replace him. (3) we would suggest that you consider altering the nature of the Can Iao Party from its present secret character to that of a normal political party which operates publicly, or even consider disbanding it. If the first alternative is adopted, various methods of convincing the population that the action has been taken might be used, such as party publication of a list of its members. The purpose of this action would be to eliminate the atmosphere of secrecy and fear and reduce the public suspicion of favoritism and corruption, which the Can Iao Party's secret status has fostered according to many reports we have heard in and out of the Government.

ENSE Ji t;0V 11 MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY GATES From Brig Gen Lansdale, OSOOSDc Subject Vietnam With the news that President Dicm Has put down thc revolt in Saigon and is rapidly re-establishing his authority, it would be useful to give somc thought to what comes ncxt. Here are some initial personal thoughts which might be of help in considering the situation. Thc revolt undoubtedly has taught a lesson to Dicrn. He might well read this lcsson as tcaching him to mistrust large segments of the armed forces and, possibly, thc utility of the'way MAAG advisors are placed with Vietnamese units. After all, officers and men in thc revolt ' were quite close to thc American military. Thus, it is possible that he vill tend to take even closer personal command of thc armed forces and do some shaking up by his own personal direction. If so, then this will make General McGarr's role with President Dicm of vital importance to thc United States. It would bc useful to gct States agreement to free General McGarr to confer with President Dicm as closely and as continuously as necessary, under only broad guidtmcc to attain U.Sobjectives, without thc Ambassador insistingupon McGarr checking with him every five minutes. Of course, the lesson we would like him to learn is that hc slcould change, some of his ways, since somc of Elis people felt strongly enough about it to take up arms against him. This is normally a task for thc Ambassador, when it comes to conveying U.S. views on such delicate internal matters to a Chief of State. However, it is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrov has any personal stature remaining. Diem must feel that Durbrow sided with the revolters emotionally. Perhaps hc even feels that Durbrovs remarks over thc months hclpcd incite the revolt. Thus, it would bc useful to get Durbrow out of Saigon. A graceful way would bc to have him coma home to report1      SECRET 15 November 1960 MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY DOUGLAS From Brig Gen Lansdale, OSOOSD Subject Vietnam In determining U.S. policy towards Vietnam in the immediate future, you might find the following personal observations of help President Ngo Diah Diem will have the 1954 coup attempt of General Minh in mind as he deals with the leaders of the 1960 coup attempt and receives U.S. advice about punishment. In 1954, Diem was persuaded to let Minh and his key officers leave the country unpunished. A few weeks later, they were instigating a revolt by the sect forces against Diem which led to considerable bloodshed in March and April 1955. President Diem always . felt that a little more firmness with a few individuals would have cooled many of the hot-heads who later listed to Minh. The 1954 and 1960 events have enough similarities to make the 1954 lesson fresh in his mind. Both coup attempts were in November. The military leader of each claimed inspiration from Nasser of Egypt and had rather close ties with former chief of state Bao Dai. Both had imprecise programs of political aims, stated as generalized ideals which sounded as phoney as a $3bi11 to the people they hoped would rally to their cause, but which coincided with a French analysis of the desires of the U.S. Ambassador and his political staff. Both were certain that Army units wouldn't act against them; both woeed the sect organizations and the same political parties; both seem to share the same friends and acquaintances in France and Cambodia. The actions of the U.S. Ambassador undoubtedly have deepened President Diems suspicions of his motivations. Diem cannot help but wonder at U.S. objectives as voiced by such a SECRET 1330 .     f . SECRET spokesman. At the most critical moment of the coup attempt, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diem to give in to rebel demands to avoid bloodshed. Earlier, he had urged others to urge Diem to compromise with the rebels. The most charitable view that Diem could take would be that our Ambassador is a badly-informed man, but he would also then believe that the Ambassador has been far too prone to listen to the wrong people in Vietnam, people who are Diems enemies. Actually, Ambassador Durbrow is not entirely to biome for these blunders. The invitation to engage in this badly-timed and demoralizing meddling in Vietnams affairs was given the Ambassador by the Southeast Asia desk staff in State message 775- This action, on top of many others which seem to have weakened both the U.S. position and the cause of freedom in Southeast Asia in the immediate past, should make us note that advice and actions of this staff carry definite hazards to the security of the U.S. Their advice and instructions on the next events in Vietnam deserve the most careful scrutiny and evaluation, particularly by Defense whose resources are called upon so heavily to carry out U.S. policy in this area. The long-known strategic value of Southeast Asia places a premium upon our military participation. Finally, it appears that General McGarr, the MAAG Chief, came through this test of U.S. influence very well. Both the rebel forces and the loyal forces turned to him for counsel. He seems to have handled them with complete honesty and objectivity which will increase his potential for influencing the Vietnamese military in the future. This is a factor which should carry its proper weight in future considerations of our actions in Vietnam. Also, it should be borne in mind that this will subject General McGarr to considerable vindictive attack by the Vietminh and by those jealous of his increased prestige. These observations are prompted by the fact that it is critical that U.S. plicy makers have some deeper understanding of people and events in Vietnam, if we are to keep Southeast Asia free. It is our fey piece in the area and must be handled correctly. Although this memo deals with a most sensitive subject, you may wish to show it to General Lemnitzer and Assistant Secretary Irwin who also are concerned with this problem.

In addition, the anticipated increase in th$ cost.of providing the Vietnamese Armad Forces ' with an H-34- hticoptor maintenance capability will rcouire provision of additional funds to the FV 6.1 Military Assistance Progr<.m for Vietnam.

LIMIT DISTRIBUTION Some three weeks after coup, following are my evaluation and recommendations On surface life has returned to normal, Viet Cong activities appear to have diminished somewhat, although this could be lull before storm; Diem has not adopted vengeful attitude against rebels, although certain others have sought take advantage of situation for "settlement of accounts" and some of "peoples" actions against rebels' families, newspapers, et cetera, were unfortunate; Diem has taken some steps recommended by us in military field, i.e., partially placed Civil Guard under defense (this being clarified); is reportedly working on plan to set up what we hope will be effective operations commands, including reorganization and streamlining of field headquarters which we hope will be allowed to operate through firm chain-of-command, Diem, Nhu and Thuan have told us they working on other reforms, i.e. election youth representatives to village councils, eventual implementation elective representatives to National Economic Council, plan for periodic "fireside chats," promised reorganization of the cabinet structure, and other unspecified moves which Thuan promised would be worked out by Christmas. It is hoped that these reforms are not just reforms on surface with little or no substance. Despite these signs, there is basically quite serious under-current maiaise and skepticism whether effective reforms will be taken soon enough. This uneasy feeling not confined to intellectuals or . opposition groups; but to sizeable number of others, i.e., cabinet SECRET 1334 .    By NWD Dale 2011 SECRET -2- 1151, December 4, 2 p.m., (SECTION 1 OF 2), from Saigon cabinet Ministers, other loyal officials, deputies and some military. Nhu and Thuan have indicated that Diem, who not particularly interested fundamental political matters, is resisting some suggested basic reforms. Nhu and Diem still deeply rankled particularly by critical American press stories about autocratic regime and entourage, and Diem made the ridiculous statement to Ladejinsky November 30th that he believes some Americans may have backed coup because one of coup leaders, Colonel Dong, "told him so during negotiations." This may represent rationalization blame others not selves. Diem probably drawing on his "miracle theory" refuses admit rebels could have captured or killed him if they had believed through initial advantage (General Khanh told me 3rd after first rebel attack morning 115th there were only 30 defenders in Palace which could have been easily taken) and both Nhu and Diem now expressing deep displeasure because "Americans equated Diem regime with rebels because both anti-Communists and therefore we urged both sides negotiate, while under circumstances their attitude understandable, we have made point clear to them that we did all in our power to prevent bloodshed and urge rebels when they had power to oust Diem that he should be given active role in any government established, while hothead can Lao party members who organized committee against Communists colonialists have been calmed down somewhat, this element could regain momentum and cause further trouble if unleashed again by CVN. Just below surface there is much talk about another coup unless Diem relaxes some controls, puts in effective reforms, takes more effective action to fight VC and give protection to population. There is still strong under-current of resentment against entourage but because any action he took this score would be under pressure and indicate weakness, and particularly his resentment of press stories about entourage, coupled with fact Diem feels he made Nhu as loyal adviser, prospects Diem will transfer Nhu to other work or abroad not in sight, at least for some time. Despite this malaise and feeling about entourage, most SECRET 1335      SECRET -3- 1151, December 4, 2.p.m. (SECTION 1 OF 2), from Saigon most critics' still respect Diem as only leader at moment but this feeling could easily change unless he takes fairly drastic action to meet criticism and basic desires most strata population. we believe also that unless Diem takes early effective action on political front, coup has increased chances for development neutralism and for anti-Americanism among those critical of GVN. Despite our close identification with Diem and his regime critics have not to date bracketed us with government in expressing their dissatisfaction. Many have told us however that only we can induce Diem adopt changes which will save his regime, thus indicating they look to us to help them. If, after failure of clearly anti-Communist coup attempt to bring about changes we are not successful in inducing Diem to make peaceful changes, critics may well become frustrated, turn against U.S., seek other means bring about change and might even move toweard neutralist position in middle. If Viet Cong guerrilla successes in countryside continue at rate registered during past year, this will also increase frustration of armed forces and population and could provide soil in which neutalism may grow.

Laos has never bcen a national entity governed by sure and united authority. Its people lack a sense of national loyalty and identity and they continue to be- divided by traditional ethnic, regional, and family antagonisms. A gulf has always existed between the central government in Vientiane and the people in the countryside, and those who have governed Laos have never established effective authority or won the respect . of all of the various pcoples who make up the Laotian nation. The non-Communist political factions have never achieved unity or cohesion and have tended to view one another with as much suspicion as they do the Communist left. As a result, no strong, effective ' non-Communist leadership has emerged since Laos achievcd independence. These fundamental weaknesses in the political and social fabric of Laos have been brought again to the surface and accentuated since Kong Le seized control vf Vientiane in early August. Indeed, developments since the coup were m?.dc possible, almost inevitable, by the incoherent nature of the country, its leaders, and its people. This' chaos has been compounded by contradictory and inconsistent Western counsel and by the wide attraction of neu-traIism, however vaguely understood, among . many Laotians2. The principal political elcments in Laos, aside.from the Communist-dominated Pathet Laothe Souvanna Phouma government in Vientiane, the Revolutionary Committee set up by Phoumi and Boun Oum at Savanna-khct, and King Savang at the royal capital of Luang Prabanghave been unwilling to work-together. Alone none of them has the fol lowing, the national status, and the military strength to contain the Pathct Lao. The Laotian Army, spread thin in small often iso-latcd units, has been uncertain in its loyalties. A majority of the commanders lean to Phoumi and the Revolutionary Committee although some still support Souvannas government. Others scck to maintain a neutral position in the struggle among the non-Com- munist factions. Few of them, however, ap-pfear willing to flghf one another. Some com- mandcrs are anti-Pathet Lao and ready to do battle with that enemy. 3. Under cover of the confusion, and taking advantagc of both thc stalemate .among the non-Communist elcments and the desire of . Souvanna and Kong Lc for a negotiated end to the civil conflict, thc Pathet Lao have steadily improved their political and military positions. Thus, Kong Les act of mutiny set in motion a chain of events in Laos which could lead to the countrys departure from its western orientation and its entry into the Communist orbit. 4. Kong Les mutiny and its aftermath have also had deep repercussions in Sot heast Asia, particularly in Thailand and South Vietnam. Thailands Prime Minister, Sarit, is con-vinccd that either a Communist takeover or the establishment of a neutral! coalition government in La<j)S would seriously threaten Thai security. Either development, he feels, would dangerously expose his country to Communist infiltration, subversion, and attack, and would generate strong pressures inside Thailand for a more neutralist policy. Moreover, he believes it would undermine his own personal position. Hc almost certainly views US policy in thc Laotian crisis as providing a SECRET 1 1340      'SECRET > demonstration of whr.t support he could expect from thc US if a Communist coup against his government were to occur. .Thus far, he has becn most disillusioned by US policy . in the Laotian crisis, feeling it to be indc- cisivc and ambiguous5. As a result of thc developments in Laos .' and the 11 November copp attempt in Saigon, President Diem of South Vietnam probably has lost some of his confidence in US willingness to support fully his anti-Communist position. He may believe that the Saigon coup eNort was at least partly stimulated by Kong Les coup and thc failure of thc US to extend General Phoumi full and immediate support. Moreover, these events, coming on thc heels of US efforts to convince him to hold less tightly the reigns of power in his own gov-emment, have probably further undermined his confidence in US judgment. From Diems point of view, an anti-Communist Laos pro-vidcs some shield against a North Vietnamese attack, and southern Laos, at least, must be kept in anti-Communist hands to avoid criti-. cally exposing his own borders to infiltration and attack6. The outcome of the immediate crisis, insofar as internal considerations apply, rests primarily with the interplay of the intentions and capabilities of the major Laotian elements Souvanna, Phoumi, the King, Kong Le, and-the Pathet Lao. 7. Souvan; Compared with other Laotian politicians, Souvanna has considerable per- sonal prestige and appeal among the peoples of Laos. Ke is stnl Prime Minister, but he controls no organized political apparatus, hc lacks administrative control of the countryside and command of the Laotian military, . and hc is not trusted by the King. A quorum of the National Assembly, chosen in highly corrupt elections in May of 1960, remains in Vientiane, but almost certainly a number  of its members, if free of duress, would oppose Souvanna or defect to the Phoumi group. 8. Souvanna is neutralist and leftist, but we do not believe that he is a Communist. Sou-vannas leadership qualities are weakened by his impulsiveness, willful disregard of un- ' 2 pleasant facts, 'and over-weaning sclf-confi-dcncc, particularly with regard to his ability to deal with and control thc Pathct Lao. He bclicvcs most of thc Pathct Lao to be patriots who, once reintegrated into Laotian political and social lifc, would losc their Communist coloration. Those few hardcore types who would remain Communists, hc statcs, could be kcpt in check. Accordingly, thc only fca-sible solution for Laos, in Souvannas mind, is a ncgotiatcd settlement with thc Pathct Lao along thc lincs of the 1957 agreement, and a neutral foreign policy. Souvanna is moving Laos in thc direction that he has maintained for scvcral years it should move. However, wc believe that it is moving at a faster pace than Souvanna would countc-nance if hc were master of his government and free from thc pressures Kong Le and thc Pathet Lao exert on him in Vientiane. 9. Early in thc crisis, Souvanna apparently had hoped to strengthen his negotiating position vis-a-vis the Pathct Lao. He was unable to use Kong Lc to this end bccausc Kong Le tended to be more amenable to thc Pathct Lao than to Souvanna. At one time Souvanna probably believed that a combination of Kong Le and Pathct Lao military pressure on thc one hand, and US political pressure on Phoumi on the other, would forcc the latter to capitulate, thus restoring his governments authority over the troops and areas controlled by ( thc Revolutionary Committee. Although hc has attempted to open negotiations with thc Boun Oum-Phoumi group, his conditions have been unattractive to Phoumi, and, at times, seemed to be calculated insults. Recently Souvanna has attempted to strengthen his position by recruiting scvcral new battalions of troops in Vientiane. However, these units are probably infiltrated by the Pathct Lao. 10. Souvanna also hoped to win over thc troops in thc Luang Prabang area which had attempted to maintain a neutral position. However, this hope was dashed by the pro-Savannakhet coup of 10 Noveinbcr and thc subsequent defection of General Ouan to Sa-yannakhet. This was a serious blow to Sou-vanna, and he attempted to compensate for it .by drawing closer to thc Communists in i .     SECRET ZN both the domestic and international spheres. On 17 November, his govemmqnt and the Communist Neo Lao Hak Xat announced an agreement to establish a national coalition government including representatives of thc NLHX. The agreement also provided that ; the government would soon accept, aid from Communist China and North Vietnam and would scnd a delegation to. those countries to negotiate for exchange of economic and cultural relations, for the re-establishment of telecommunications with North Vietnam, and for the immediate opening of thc Laos-China border. On 29 November, Souvannas cabinet named a lO-man friendship mission, headed by the Prime Minister, for a visit to Peiping and Hanoi beginning 10 December. Deliveries of Soviet food and POL to Vientiane have begun and a 3-man Soviet Embassy staff has . taken up residence in Vientiane. i- 11. Thus, Souvanna now relies very heavily  upon the support of pro-Communist and Kong Le elements. It appears that this will continue, and that as opposition to him mounts he will keep on seeking broader and more h specific support from the Communist Bloc. Souvanna probably still hopes to keep Communist influence in check, but some of his measures to protect his position by movingcloser to thc Communists are irrevocable, and most, if not all, of them have been highly favorable to future Communist domination of the Vientiane Government. I ; . 12. Phoumi. The position of Phoumi, and i of the Revolutionary Committee he has sct up with Boun Oum. has a number of serious weaknesses. In southern Laos, there are about 7,500 combat troops, most of whom are under commanders probably loyal to Phoumi. 1 Most of these troops are scattered widely . through the area, and have their hands full attempting to cope with local Pathct Lao activities. In the Thakhet-Savannakhet area, Phoumi, has about 1,500 troops. He is in . thc process of recruiting and organizing an additional battalion. It is unlikely that Phoumis troops without continued US assistance could or would offer very strong or effective resistance to a determined attack on their positions by Vientiane and Pathet Lao forces. 3 1 13. Phoumis military capabilities have mark- i edly increased since he , received additional US aid and moral support. Moreovcr, thc pro-Savannakhct coup of 10 November in Luang Prabang greatly improved Phoumis military and political positions. Ncarly all the commanders in the Luang Prabang region have pledged their support to him. Scvcral small units operating against thc Pathct Lao in Sam Ncua arc being supplied by Phoumi and are probably responsive to his guidance. Phoumi is handicapped, however, by' poor communications with these units. In Xieng Khouang, thc militant Meo tribesmen are bcing supplied with arms by Phoumi and arc currently conducting effective anti-Pathct Lao operations. 14. The Revolutionary Committee probably has some political appcal in southern Laos. Boun Oum is a mcmbcr of the Royal Family of Champassak which ruled southern Laos until Laos was united by thc French following thc Second World War. However, wc bclieve that Boun Cum and Phoumi lack broad political appcal outside the south. Phoumis loss of prestige among both political and military leaders in Laos as a result of the Kong Lc .coup has been only partially made up by thc Luang Prabang coup and General Ouans defection. Moreover, Phoumi has in I the past proved to be an undependable and, at times, careless military leader, highly am- ' bitious and opinionated. 15. Phoumis. motivations in the present situation are probably a combination of personal pride and anti-Communist convictions. He is frustrated by what hc believcs to be inadequate US support and an ambiguous US policy. However, he probably has never intended to come to terms with Souvanna, and probably has felt that the US would, in thc final analysis, support him. He would like to retake Vientiane by force and almost certainly has plans for such an operation. 16. King Savang. The King appears to.have no personal courage. He has been extremely careful to stay within constitutional limits and he has nevcr asserted; openly and clearly, his potential authority and influence. Although it is quite clear that he distrusts SECRET 13112      SECRET 4 l Souvanna and desires Souvannas resignation, thus far he has bccn unwilling to take any overt-steps to this end. The Revolutionary Committee at Savannakhet received the Kings private approval, and the 10 Novcmbcr coup in Luang Prabang probably had his blessing, although thus far'he has bccn careful to avoid associating himself with either. It is possible that the King has played a significant behind-the-scenes role in the anti-Souvanna plotting and maneuvering. It is unlikely, however, that he will openly take a strong personal stand,- or one which he belicves would endanger the position of thc monarchy. 17. Kong Le. There is some circumstantial evidence that Kong Le rnay have plotted his coup with Souvanna. However, Kong Les August revolt apparently was conceived and executed on very short notice, and it may have been a decision made primarily by Kong Le himsclf. He probably was motivated largely by personal grievances arising from the way in which his 2nd Paratroop Battalionthc best combat unit in the Laotian armed forceshad been treated. However, the revolt has assumcd proportions and opened up ramifications which Kong Le probably did not anticipate and which have been beyond his ability to cope with. He has now become so implicated with Souvanna and the Pathct Lao that he probably cannot turn back. Although there have been some indications that his control over his troops has bccn weakened, Kong' Le is still an important element in thc situation and could still rally a considerable number of troops to his personal cont-mand. 18. The role of Kong Le vith respect to the . activities of the Souvanna government is not clear. Until recently, it appeared that he exercised a veto power over those political and military decisions of thc Souvanna govcrn-ment which he considered important to him. Now, however, it appears that his direct influence on thc government is being usurped by the Pathet Lao. Although Kong Lc has lim-ted Souvannas freedom of action, it is also clear that Souvanna has used Kong Le. 19. Shortly after the coup, Kong Lc critically # compromised his position with respect to thc Pathct Lao when hc distributed1 thc arms stored in Vientiane to villagers, including many Pathct Lao, in thq surrounding area. Although he probably did this to build strength against a possible attack from Luang Prabang and Savannakhet, oncc the arms were distributed his favorablc balance of military power in the Vientiane area vis-a-vis thc Pathct Lao was lost. Whatever his own wishes may have been, Kong Le has become increasingly a captivc of the Pathet Lao. If Souvanna were to losc out and an anti-Pathct , Lao government take over, Kong Le would probably join the Pathct Lao. 20. The Pathct'Lao. The hand of the Pathct Lao has bcen strengthencd greatly by events since the Kong Le coup. Any figures concerning thc strength of their armed guerrillas arc highly speculative. It is almost certain that their number is higher than at any time in thc past. We estimate their present strength to be between 4,000 and 8,000. They have obtained considerable arms and ammunition from Kong Le and as a result of capturing equipment during the rout of Phoumis-forces at Paksane and their defeat and disarming of the Sam Neua garrison. They probably have been reinforced by cadres recently trained in North Vietnam, and they probably have concentrated increasing numbers of troops in the areas around Vientiane, Thakhct-, Savannakhet, Phong Saly, and Luang Pra-bang. Thc Pathet. Lao and Vientiane forces in the Vientiane area arc deployed in such a manner as to either defend or attack the city, and the forces facing Phoumi along the Nam Ca Dinh line are of both Pathct Lao and Vientiane units. At present, anti-Pathct, Lao operations are going on only in Phong Saly and Xieng Khouang. 21. The Pathet Lao probably view thc developing situation as a golden opportunity cither to force acccptance of their participation in the government and their foreign policy demands, or to seize control of Laos by armed action if they conclude that thcy can do so quickly and without risking outside ini . vention. We do not believe that the Pathct Lao SECRET      . " ' ' ' . SEC -v or Peiping and Hanoiare likely to let this opportunity pass. Thc longer thc present crisis- continues, the better the athet Lao will be ablc to consolidate thch political and rnili-tary positions. > 22. They would prefer to-gain their objectives through negotiations and political action bc-causc this would reduce- the chances of outside intervention. Evcnts since the Kong Le coup have moved along lines favorable to such tactics. They have profited greatly from disunity among the non-Communist political and military leaders. Moreover, thcy hold Vicn-tiane virtually a hostage and have been ablc to exert considerable-leverage on Souvanna j and Kong Le, and Quinim, the most influential member of the government after Sou-vanna himself, has apparently become their  tool. ' ' 23. Although Pathet Lao tactics have emphasized negotiations, psychological pressures, and political action, they have maintained a fairly high level of military prcssure on the Laotian armed forces and have built up their  guerrilla strength in key areas. This puts , them in a favorable position to seize by force large parts of the country, including such key t points as Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, the Phong Saly. If the Pathet Lao were to exert their full guerrilla warfare capabilities, the Laotian armed forces, in their present disor-j- ganized condition, probably could not prevent the loss of large parts of thc countryside and a number of key towns. II. POSSlBtE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS . 24. If present trends continue, the situation in Laos will remain one of confusion, drift, and disintegration. Ultimately this would probably result in thc fragmentation of the country, with the Communists, supported by I the Bloc, assuming control over most of the north and thc Revolutionary Committee at. tempting to set up a separate state in the j south. Without large amounts of outside assistance, a separate southern Laos probably would not survive for long. I 25. We believe it more likely, however, that the pace of events will quicken over thc next .- .1 SEC ( RET 5 j I lcw wccks and, barring a quick victory by thc Phoumi forces,, that thc situation cither will move toward some form of political settlement or will degenerate into vidcsprcad civil war. Although-a political settlement bascd on a . j compromise agreement betwccn thc Vientiane and Savannakhet groups may still bc possible, wc believe that odd.s arc against it. Souvanna and Phoumi arc not likely to find mutually acceptable terms for coopcration at this late point in their conflict. Any negotiations held bctwccn thcm arc not likcly to be conducted in good faith. Although it is con-ccivable that thc King might be induced to exert more influence than he has in thc past, . we do not believc hc can be induced to takc personal charge of the situation. Moreover, we do not bclieve that Souvanna is likcly to resign voluntarily. If an effort is made to upset his government by calling a special meeting of the National Assembly in Luang Prabang to pass a no-confidence motion, Sou-vanna could maintain that thc dcputics and , the King, as prisomers of rcbcI forces, were acting under duress. Hc could declare their act illegal and invalid, and maintain that he wls the Icgal head of thc government. If, cn the other hand, Souvanna were forced out by political pressures, thc Pathct Lao would probably step up sharply their military activity. Consequently, it is probable that any political measures to oust Souvanna will bc ineffectual unless enforced by military means. 26. Thus, we belicve that Laos is heading toward civil war, with supporters of the Sou-vanna governmentprimarily the Pathet Lao and the followers of Kong Leon one side and anti-Pathct Lao elements and supporters of thc Savannakhet group on the other. The conflict could be triggered by a Phoumi at- ; tack on Vientiane or by a Souvanna or a Kong Le-Pathet Lao attack on Luang Prabang. Both sides have major problems of logistics, communications, and transport. The strug-glc would probably be onc of widely-scattered, small-unit operations in which the staying power, thc training, and the relatively shorter supply lines from North Vietnam would give the Pathct Lao guerrillas an advantage. Without extensive outside assistance, the Phoumi forces would probably soon collapse, RET ; 1 I .     SECRET i 6 leaving thc country open to early domination by the Communists. 27. If no political settlement is reached be-twecn Phoumi and Souvanna. thc US may soon be faced with thc following situations  (a) A Souvanna solution, which would gravely  risk ultimate Communist 'supremacy. This would involve scrious adverse consequences for thc US position in Southeast Asia, and over the longer run, would greatly facilitate Communist subversion, infiltration, and expansion in Southeast Asia, (b) A widespread civil war in which the Phoumi forces almost certainly could not prevail or even survive without extensive outside assistance. Such assistance to Phoumi in a civil war situation would probably prompt a Souvanna appeal to the UN and. would risk the introduction of North Vietnamese or even Chinese Communist volunteers. While at least initially, extensive assistance to Phoumi in a civil tyar would not have the support of the Western members of SE.ATO or possibly of most Free World opinion, if successful it would strengthen the SEATO arca against further Communist aggression. I 28. Even if thc various non-Communist factions surmount the immediate crisis by a political settlement, the fundamental politi- cal and social problems of Laos will remain and, as a result of recent cvcnts, will prob. ably bc more acutc than bcforc. Pathct Lao armed strength will bc greater and more Communist footholds cstablishcd in villages throughout thc country. Solutions to thc fundamcntal problems,- if indccd there are solutions, can be workcd out only ovcr a long pcriod of time. Meanwhile, the urgent threats of thc Pathct Lao on one hand and the centrifugal force of non-Communist disunity on the other, will opcrate against thc solution of long-term problems. 29. Consequently, we believe that any nonCommunist government assuming power in thc wake of the present crisis would, in time, face vcry hcavy pressure to movc toward a neutralist position and Pathct Lao intcgra-tion into thc political lifc of the country, or face the likelihood of the situation gravitating again toward civil war. It will be extremely difficult for thc non-Communist leaders of Laos to resist this pressure and to contain the Pathct Lao unless they develop a much greater degree of unity, determination, and nationalism than they have in thc past, take effective measures to win thc loyalty of the peoples of Laos, and reccivc cxtcnsive outside assistance to this end.

I have also reported on the progress being made in working out new policies, and organizational and liberalization changes in the governmental and military structure which you and other officials have informed us you are planning to implement in the near future. As you know, my Government has taken certain steps to assist you in strengthening the GVN against the Communist attacks being made against it. The new AD-6 planes whose delivery was speeded up I understand are proving effective and helpful, and you are aware of the large quantity of electronic communications equipment MAAG and USOM secured on an expedited basis. Lastly, I have instructed Mr. Gardiner to seek an appointment with the Vice President and Secretary of State Thuan to re-examine carefully the entire problem of your piastre shortage to see whether there may be some new technique or action to meet your critical need in this area. Your comparatively satisfactory foreign exchange and balance of payments position has of course created special problems which we hope we can jointly solve. t On the basis of these reports I have received instructions to discuss these matters with you, particularly certain liberalizing projects which would have a favorable effect on world public opinion. As you no doubt know, Mr. President, since the press conference held by Mr. Thuan on November 17 at which he stated that the Government had for some time been working out details for new organizational and liberalization schemes, many elements here in Viet-Nam and in the world press have questioned whether these projected schemes would be adequate and sufficiently profound to increase the public support for your Government and make it clear to world opinion that tl criticisms of your Government in the world press were unfounded.

Apart from the organizational changes proposed in the governmental and military structure and those liberalizing schemes you have told me about such as elections of youths to village councils and other progressive matters of this nature -- we believe it would be helpful if you could also adopt the measures outlined below, we, of course, recognize that security considerations impose certain limitations on liberalization, but we believe that the political situation requires certain calculated risks in order that the public and world opinion will become convinced of the sincerity of the steps you are takeing to evoke broad participation in your efforts to improve security and develop the economy and institutions of Viet-Nam. It is our belief that the liberalization schemes should be clear-out, effective, and of a broad nature so that the impact of their announcement will have the desired beneficial effect on the public here and abroad and will enhance the public support for your regime, with this thought in mind, it is suggested that 1. In connection with the excellent .new method of having Ministers defend their budgets before Assembly Committees, it would be advantageous . from a political and press point of view either to publicize these hearings in full or at least to give fairly full minutes of these meetings to the press. 2. As has already been suggested, it would be politically worthwhile to authorize the Assembly to conduct investigations of any Department or Agency, of the Government. While public hearings would be politically more . useful, closed hearings could be held providing the results of the investiga- tions are made public in considerable detail. 3. While it is realized that it is not a simple matter to work out an effective domestic press code, we believe it would be most beneficial to a better understanding of the fruitful efforts being made by your Government on behalf of the people and a better appreciation of the many problems you and your colleagues have to face, if the Assembly could adopt in the hear future a fairly liberal press code. If this cannot be accomplished . rortly, the press should be encouraged to set up machinery to police itself. Under such a system the Government should only intervene if articles are flagrantly dishonest, inaccurate, or favorable to the Communists. In case of a breach of the press code it might be better to require the paper to publish a full retraction rather than confiscate the particular edition or suspend the newspaper. 4. I have already discussed with you our suggestions on ways and means to have more favorable foreign press coverage. In this connection, the Department of State believes that it is almost as important for your Government to have favorable foreign press relations as it is to have diplomatic recognition from friendly countries. The Department suggests that you continue to have periodic press conferences such as those recently conducted by Mr. Thuan, that SECRET LIMIT DISTRIBUTION 1354       rage j  'Enclosure 1 Dispatch From Saigon effective use be made of the weekly press conferences.of the Directorate General of Information by channelling items of substantive information through that agency for release, that foreign correspondents be permitted to make trips in the country to learn for themselves the nature of the Viet Cong threat, and that Ministers ofthe Government be available to have open and frank talks with correspondents about the accomplishments and problems of the various Ministries. It is believed, that this might be helpful in improving the tone of foreign press articles. 5. we are pleased to learn that steps are being taken to increase and stabilize the price of paddy to the peasants, we also suggest that further efforts be made to grant broader credit facilities to the peasantsIt is the belief of the Department of State that if measures such as those suggested above, in addition to the other liberalizing steps . regarding elections of youth representatives to village councils, sending better administrators into the countryside, periodic "fireside chats", etc., are adopted in the near future, it would be worthwhile to withhold the announcement of individua.1 measures, so that a meaningful official announcement could be made,preferably by you, of all of the liberalizing measures you are putting into immediate effect. If the individual measures were not disclosed in advance, such an across-the-board announcement of genuine liberalizing measures would, . we believe, have a most beneficial effect on thc people of Viet-Nam and on world opinion. It is certain that such an announcement would do a great deal to correct any erroneous impressions that have becn given to world opinion in recent months and encourage the world press and govern-ment spokesmen to support you in your tireless efforts to eliminate the Viet Cong threat and continue the fine progress attained in Viet-Nam in such a short period of time.  1355      1961 .

LANG Director, Office of Foreign Military Rights Affairs       SECRET FOREIGN SERVICE DESPATCH American Embassy Saigon 276 Desp No. The Department of State, washington January 4, 1961 Department Telegram 658, October 20, 1960 Subject Counter Insurgency Plan for South Viet-Nam Reference is made to joint State DOD message, Departments 658 of October 20, 1960, and Defense message DEF 982994 of September 16, 1960, both of which set forth the requirements for the development of an over-all United States plan for encouraging and supporting the Government of Viet-Nam in the present National emergency. Such a plan has been developed by the Country Team and is attached as an enclosure to this despatch for review by interested washington agencies. The plan was drafted by a Country Team staff committee composed of the following members MAAGCol. F. W. Boye, Jr., Major Kurtz J. Miller, Jr., and Captain Boyd Bashore; Embassy -Joseph A. Mendenhall (Chairman) and Andrew J. Fink; USOMJames W. Howe and william R. Trigg; USISJohn M. Anspacher; and DSA -william E. Colby and Clarence E. Barbier. Because of the importance of military factors in the development of the plan, MAAG assumed the major burden in its preparation, and is to be congratulated on the excellent job it has done. The plan,based on tasks and concepts outlined in the CINCPAC and OASDISA plan for counter-insurgency operations, not only sets forth recommended action in the military field, but also establishes requirements for coordinated and supporting action in the political, economic and psychological fields. In developing the tasks to be undertaken the plan also presents recommendations and justificati n concerning requirements for United States personnel, materiel, funds and organizational and operational concepts. The Country Team Plan consists of a summary and three Annexes, which discuss Task Organization, Concept of Operations and Logistics. Each Annex a! o has appropriate appendices which spell out in detail the tasks, the present situation with regard thereto and recommended action. The plan is complete except for appendices relating to a study of , the non-military communications system and to economics and finance. These will be forwarded upon completion as supplements to the plan enclosed herewith. SECRET . 1357      SECRET Page 2 of Despatch No. 276 .' From SAIGON t Certain recommendations have already been discussed with the Government of Viet-Nam (GVN). Some of these actions have already been agreed to by the GVN (e.g., transfer of the Civil Guard to the GVN Department of Defense and creation of a national Internal Security Council), and others are under study by the GVN (e.g., establishment of a military operational command for counter-insurgency operations, reorganization of military regions, and implementation of a firm military chain of command). In addition there are other actions which will shortly be taken up with the GVN such as establishment of internal security councils at every governmental level, implementation of proposals for the establishment of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (previously discussed several times with the GVN, but to be pushed again) and creation of a village level coinmuni cat ions system. There are, however, certain actions which involve major expenditures and will not be discussed with the GVN prior to washington approval. The most important of these latter actions is the proposed 20,000 man increase in the size of the RVNAF which was presented for washington consideration in Embassy telegram 1151, December 4. I maintain reservations concerning theproposal to increase the force level up to 20,000 additional RVNAF troops, purely to meet the threat in Viet-Nam and still believe more calculated risks should be taken by using more of the forces in being to meet the immediate and serious guerrilla terrorist threat. I recognize, however, that additional well-trained forces in being in this area are probably now justified from purely US interest point of view in order to meet growing bloc threat SEA represented by the Soviet airlift in Laos. (See Embassy Telegram 1231, December 29.) MAAG Comments The MAAG position on the need for a 20,000 force increase continues as reported in MAAG telegrams to CINCPAC (CHMAAG 1579, 27 Dec 60 and CHMAAG 1620, 29 Dec 60) which were also forwarded to washington. a. The military requirement for this force increase to accomplish the current mission had been demonstrated in MAAG . considered opinion as early as August 1960. This force increase . was badly needed before the beginning of the Soviet airlift in Laos. The recent Viet Minh overt aggression against Laos merely reinforces this requirement. b. The four divisions in the North in I and II Corps areas are committed in anti-guerrilla and static guard duty to an extent which not only cuts down their capability to resist overt attack and thus magnifies the risk to a militarily unacceptable degree, but also prohibits required training to adequately SECRET 1358 .     SECRET Page 3 of Despatch No. 276 From SAIGON counter either external or internal aggression. c. Additionally, the force increase will provide the long needed balance between combat and logistic support. A number of recommendations in the plan, considered by the Country Team to be indispensable and in the GVNs own best interests, will probably not be particularly palatable to the GVN. This situation pertains particularly to certain political actions and concepts of the military-civilian relationship. However, these questions are an integral part of the overall plan and are essential to its successful accomplishment. Consideration should, therefore, be given to what actions we are prepared to take to encourage, or if necessary to force, acceptance of all essential elements of the plan.

SECRET 1359      ' TO THE PRESIDENT September 29, 1967 FROM CLARK CLIFFORD Memorandum of Conference on January 19, 1961 between President. Eisenhower and president-elect Kennedy on the Subject of Laos The meeting was he Id in the Cabinet Room with the following men pre'sent President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Christian Herter, Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, Secretary of Treasury Robert Anderso and General Wilton B. Persons. With President-elect Kennedy were the new Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the nevz Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the new Secretary of Treasury Douglas Dillon, and Clark. M. Clifford. An agenda for the meeting had been prepared by Persons and I Clifford. The subjects on the agenda hsd been recommended by the parties present at the conference and were arranged under the headings "State ense", and "Treasury.", The first subject under the head.irr of "State" WcS Laos. r opened the discussion on Laos by stat that the United States was determined to preserve the independence o Laos. It was his opinion that if Laos should fall to the Communists, then it would be just a question of time until South Viet hat th r muniss hcd s      ' I designs on all 'of Southeast Asia, end that it would be. a tragedy to penpit  . Laos to fall. .President Eisenhower gave a brief review of the various moves and coups that had taken place in Laos involving the Pathet Lao Souvanna Phouma, Boun Oum, and Kong Le. said that the evidenoe was clear' that Communist China and North Vietnam were determined to I I destroy the independence of Laos. He also added that the Russians . were sending in substantial supplies in support of the Pethet.Lao in an effort to overturn the government. President Eisenhower said it would be fatal for us to permit Communists to insert themselves in the Laotian government. He recalled that our experience had clearly demonstrated that under such circum- f stances the Communists always ended up in control. He cited China as an illustration. At this point, Secretary of State Herter intervened to state that' the present government of Laos were to apply to SEATO for aid under the ? Herter was of the positive opinion that the signatories to the SEATO Pact were bound. President Eisenhower agreed with this and in his statement gave the impression that the request for aid had already come He corroborated the binding nature of the obigation of the United States unde 1361      .

' ' Eisenhower said that if it were not appropriate for SEATO to intervene j in Laos, that Lis next preference would be the International Control . Commission. He vzas sure, however, that the Soviet Union did not -I . '   want, the ICC to go into Laos. President Eisenhower stated that ' ' this country had a choice as to whether the task should be assumed by 'SEATO or the ICC, that he personally would prefer SEATO. Secretary Herter stated that we possibly Could work out some I . f . agreement with the British, if they could be persuaded to recognize the present government in Laos. The chances of accomplishi? this, however, appeared to be remotet . J.- I Secretary Herter stated, with President Eisenhower's aooroval, . > -. t that we should continue every effort to make a political settlement in j ' Laos. Ke added, however, that if such efforts were fruitless, then .. the United States must intervene in concert with our allies. If tvs were " t unable to persuade our allies, then we must go it alone. ... At this point, President Eisenhower said with Considerable emotion that Laos was the key to the entire area of Southeast Asia. He said that if we permitted Laos to fall, then we would have to write off all the area. He stated that we must not permit a Communist take-over. ne reiterated taat we should make every effort to oersuaae memoer ' .- nations of SEATO or fie IOC to ecceot the burden with us to defend the.  1   1362 ... .; ' . I      ' . . .    .. ' ' . ' .  . f .  - . < . T .freedom of Laos. As he concluded these remarks, President Eisenhower . stated it was imperative that Laos be defended. He said-that the , V" . w . United States should accept this task with our allies, if we could t t persuade them, and alone if we could not. He added that "our j( unilateral intervention would be our last desperate hope" in the event we were unable to prevail uoon the other signatories to join us.  t . ' A. At one time it was hoped that perhaps some type of arrange-  j ' ;meat could be made with Kong Le. This hed proved fruitless, however, and President Eisenhower said "he was a lost soul and wholly ; irretrievable." lL . I- . ---. ' ' t Commenting upon President Eisenhower's statement that we' 1 would have to go to the support of Laos alone if we could not persuade ...- . ' .1- 1  4   others to proceed vitn us, President-exeCt Kennedy asked the question ,r  as to how long it vould take to put an American division into Leosi Secretary Gates replied that it would take from twelve to seventeen days but that some of that time could be saved if American forces, then in the Pacific, could be utilized. Secretary Gates added that the . American forces were in excellent shape and that modernization of the Anny vas making good progress.- President-elect Kennedy commented upon the seriousness of ' the situation in Laos and in Southeast Asia and asked if the situation I ' 13G3 ..       seemed to be approaching a climax. General Eisenhower stated . I . that the entire proceeding vas extremely confused but that it was  ' .1 ' clear that this country was obligated to support the existing govern- mentinLaos. '  . The discussion of Laos led to some.concluding general ,  ' statemerits regarding Southeast Asia. It was agreed that Thailand- j i -.. ... ' 'was a valuable ally of the United States, end that one of the dangers 1 of a Communist take-over in Laos would be to expose Thailand's borders.In this regard, it vas suggested that the military training under French . supervision in Thailand was very poor and that it would be a good idea ' to get American military instructors there as soon as possible so the level of military capability could be raisedi President Eisenhower said there was some indication that Russia was concerned over Communist pressures in Laos and in " . South-cast Asia emanating from China and North Vietnam. It was felt that this attitude could possibly lead to some difficulty between i o I. ' Russia and Cmnav This phase of the discussion vas concluded by President Eisenhower in commenting philosophically upon the fact that the morale existing in the democratic forces in Laos appeared to be dis-' .     appolnting. He wondered aloud why, in interventions of this kind, we always seem to find that the morale of the Communist forces wasbetter than that of the democratic foroes. His explanation vas that the Communist philosophy appeared to produce a sense of dedication on the part of its adherents, while there was not the same sens,? of dedication on the part of those supporting the free forces. He stated that the entire problem of morale was a serious one arid would have to be taken into consideration as we became more deeply involved. l
