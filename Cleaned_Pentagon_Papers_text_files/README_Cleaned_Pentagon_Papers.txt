README for Clean_Pentagon_Papers_text_files

Methodology: The original files that the cleaned files derive from are the text files in 'Pentagon_Papers_Text_Files'. The files in this directory have been cleaned by decoding the ASCII encoding, writing the text to files, and cleaning those files further using Notepad++'s Replace tool.  

There are 48 files in total, which is one less from the original 49 Pentagon Papers. The file Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-C-10 was statistical reports that do not make much sense when OCR'd, so this was removed.
