UNCLASSIFIED WHEN SEPARATED FROM ENCLOSURE  The people who worked on the Task Force were superbuniformly bright and interested although not always versed in the art of research.

Of course we all had our prejudices and axes to grind and these shine through clearly at times but we tried we think to suppress or compensate for them.

In all we had thirty-six professionals working on these studies with an average of four months per man. The quality style and interest of the studies varies considerably. The papers in Parts I II III and IV.A concerning the years 1945 to 1961 tend to be generally non-startling--although there are many interesting tidbits. Because many of the documents in this period were lost or not kept (except for the Geneva Conference era) we had to rely more on outside resources. From 1961 onwards (Parts IV.B and C and VI.C) the records were bountiful especially on the first Kennedy year in office the Diem coup and on the subjects of the deployment of ground forces the decisions surrounding the bombing campaign against North Vietnam US-GVN relations and attempts at negotiating a settlement of the conflict. Almost all the studies contain both a Summary and Analysis and a Chronology. The chronologies highlight each important event or action in the monograph by means of date description and documentary source. The Summary and Analysis sections which I wrote attempt to capture the main themes and facts of the monographsand to make some judgments and speculations which may or may not appear in the text itself. The monographs themselves stick by and large to the documents and do not tend to be analytical. writing history especially where it blends into current events especially where that current event is Vietnam is a treacherous exercise. Ue could not go into the minds of the decision-makers we were not present at the decisions and we often could not tell whether something happened because someone decided it decided against it or most likely because it unfolded from the situation. History to me has been expressed by a passage from Herman Melville\\'s Moby Dick where he writes \"This is a world of chancefree will and necessity all interweavingly working together as one; chance by turn rules either and has the last featuring blow at events.\" Our studies have tried to reflect this thought; inevitably in the organizing and writing process they appear to assign more and less to men and free will than was the case.

Almost all the studies had several authors each heir dutifully trying to pick up the threads of his predecessor. In all we had thirty-six professionals working on these studies with an average of four months per man. The quality style and interest of the studies varies considerably. The papers in Parts I II III and IV.A concerning the years 1945 to 1961 tend to be generally non-startling--although there are many interesting tidbits. Because many of the documents in this period were lost or not kept (except for the Geneva Conference era) we had to rely more on outside resources. From 1961 onwards (Parts IV.B and C and VI.C) the records were bountiful especially on the first Kennedy year in office the Diem coup and on the subjects of the deployment of ground forces the decisions surrounding the bombing campaign against North Vietnam US-GVN relations and attempts at negotiating a settlement of the conflict. Almost all the studies contain both a Summary and Analysis and a Chronology. The chronologies highlight each important event or action in the monograph by means of date description and documentary source. The Summary and Analysis sections which I wrote attempt to capture the main themes and facts of the monographsand to make some judgments and speculations which may or may not appear in the text itself. The monographs themselves stick by and large to the documents and do not tend to be analytical. writing history especially where it blends into current events especially where that current event is Vietnam is a treacherous exercise. Ue could not go into the minds of the decision-makers we were not present at the decisions and we often could not tell whether something happened because someone decided it decided against it or most likely because it unfolded from the situation. History to me has been expressed by a passage from Herman Melville's Moby Dick where he writes \"This is a world of chancefree will and necessity all interweavingly working together as one; chance by turn rules either and has the last featuring blow at events.\" Our studies have tried to reflect this thought; inevitably in the organizing and writing process they appear to assign more and less to men and free will than was the case.
