of Ho’s communist contacts at this time is peculiar when they are forcing collaboration or preparing a puppet government; this ploy is a possible diversion from French policy in Indochina. O'Sullivan 131 to Byrnes, 3 December 1946.....................................
Acheson instructs Moffat on Ho Chi, Minh's communist record and offers guidelines of U.S. policy in discussion with Ho. Essentially, the U.S. is concerned over Tonkin events, the American people have welcomed Indochinese attainments but violence imperils this sympathy, and U.S. is informing France similarly. The U.S. is not making formal intervention at this time. Acheson 305 to Saigon, 5 December 1946................
U.S. feels France would engage in full scale military o_perations in Vietnam only if forced, since they realize it is no longer possible to maintain a closed door.

Reed 4/2 to Byrnes, 6 December 1946.........................
Secretary Byrnes reviews basic French-Vietnamese difficulties for Missions at London, Moscow, and Nanking. Essentially, the difficulties revolve around deep nationalist sentiment and opposition to the French, guided by a few communist trained leaders in the government with apparent contacts with Moscovz and Yenan. However, "French influence is important not only as an antidote to Soviet influence, but to protect Vietnam and SEA from future- Chinese imperialism." Three basic troubles are mutual distrust, French irresolution of the term "free state," and Vietnamese intransigence. Byrnes message to certain Missions, 17 December 1946........................................................
Byrnes reviews recent French political crisis and influence of Indochina policy as an important factor. Outbreak of hostilities in Hanoi seen as serious and not likely to be resolved by Moutet and d’Argenlieu.

Vincent informs Acheson that with inadequate forces and divided public opinion, the French have tried to accomplish in Indochina what a. strong, united Britain found unwise to attempt in Burma. In short, "guerrilla warfare may continue indefinitely. The

62.	U.S, advances reasons why the Vietnamese attacked the French on 19 December: (a) orders from Moscow to upset Southeast Asia, or to increase Communist Party strength in France as a result of a quick settlement if the CP should take power from Blum; and (b) hope for similar Javanese-Dutch settlement resulting from fighting while negotiating.

69.	Ths U.S. is concerned that the Western democratic r	system is on the defensive in emerging nations and
Southern Asia is in a critical phase. The key to the U.S. position is an awareness that in respect to the position of Western democratic powers in Southern Asia, the United States is in the same boat as the French, British and the Dutch. "We cannot conceive setbacks to the long range inter-ests of France which would not also be setbacks of our own." The U.S. is ready to be helpful in any way, however, non-intervention is still the U.S. policy. Marshall 1737 to Faris, 13 May 1947-................. 100

71.	M. Bollaert, French High Commissioner in Indochina, delivers publicly the most important declaration of French policy since before hostilities broke out. The French ask for a Vietnamese "representative government" to accept. French terms, and exclude dealing with Ho Chi Minh except as a last resort, and then only for his surrender. The U.S. sees this policy resulting from a strengthened France (and a proportional unwillingness to make con-cessions) as a "retreat" from the March 6 accords.

If Red China intervenes, the U.S. should take appropriate military action as part of a U.N. action or in conjunction with others but not unilaterally. Annex to NSC 124, 13 February 1952............................ 468
162.	The CIA estimates that a joint warning against CHICOM intervention in Southeast Asia would tend to deter them, that initiation of action in the U.N. would probably bring a response similar to that regarding Korea, and CHICOM defiance of a joint warning would probably involve prior consent of the USSR. CIA Spcci-l Estimate, SE-22, 29 February 1952.	477
163.	The JCS views on ESC 124 and Annex to NSC 124 are that military operations in defense of Indochina against Chinese Communist invasion must be accompanied by action against Communist China itself — a course of action which might result in a long and expensive war, and that from a military point of view, the JCS oppo n acceptance of all the military commitments of NSC 124.

EDITORIAL NOTE;	(
With the death of President Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, the indecisive policy toward Indochina took on a new approach under the new President, Harry So Truman. Shortly after being sworn in to office, UOSO policy was thoroughly reviewed,, On 13 April, the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee met and discussed the urgent need for clarification of U0S0 policy toward French-Indochina, document number 3C By 20 April, a Memorandum to the President on Indochina policy had been drafted by the State Department Division of European Affairs (EUR), documents number 5 and 6e The Division of Far Eastern Affairs (FE) revised the EUR version to the extent that it was substantially different from the original submitted, document number 7. The final compromise between the two versions resulted in a draft action cable for Paris and a Memorandum on American Policy with Respect to Indochina for the President, both of which appear as documents number 9 and 10u The record shows that the policy statements in the memorandum was neither sent to nor approved by the President and that the cable was not dispatched to Paris0 The documentation concerning this evolvement of policy is included here as a revelation of the France-Indochina commitments internal to the Department of State and the impetus lent to policy making by the War Department in the latter phase of World War II0

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject: Suggested Reexamination of American Policy with Respect to Indo-China
General Observations
I
1.	The Japanese aggression against the French in Indo-China last month has brought about a marked increase in the number of proposals advanced by the French for the use of French forces and resources in the Pacific.
2.	The consequences of these military developments make it clear that our past policy, which held that the disposition of Indo-China was a matter for post-war determination and that the United States should not become involved in military effort for its liberation, is in urgent need of reexamination and clarification. This is particularly so in order that American military and naval authorities may have guidance to enable them to take appropriate action with respect to the French pro-posals referred to above.
3.	The United States Government has publicly taken the position that it recognizes the sovereign jurisdiction of France over French possessions overseas when those possessions are resisting the enemy and has expressed the hope that it will see the reestablishment of the integrity of French territory. In spite of this general assurance, the negative policy so far pursued by this Government with respect to Indo-China has aroused French suspicions concerning our intentions with respect to the future of that territory. This has had and continues to have a harmful effect on American relations with the French Government and people.
4.	On April 3, 1945, the Secretary of State with the approval of the President issued a statement of which the following excerpt is perti-nent to the present problem:
"As to territorial trusteeship, it appeared desirable that the Governments represented at Yalta, in consultation with the Chinese Government and the French Provisional Government, should endeavor to formulate proposals for submission to the San Francisco Conference for a trusteeship structure as a part of the general organization. This trusteeship structure, it was felt, should be defined to permit the placing under it of the territories taken from the enemy in this war, as might be agreed upon at a later date, and also such other territories as right voluntarily I placed under trusteeship."

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

5.	General de Gaulle and his Government have made it abundantly clear that they expect a proposed Indo-Chinese federation to function within the framework of the "French Union." There is consequently not the slightest possibility at the present time or in the foreseeable future that France will volunteer to place Indo-China under an inter-national trusteeship, or will consent to any program of international accountability which is not applied to the colonial possessions of other powers. If an effort were made to exert pressure on the French Government, such action would have to be taken by the United States alone for France could rely upon the support of other colonial powers, notably, Great Britain and the Netherlands. Such action would likewise run counter to the established American policy of aiding France to regain her strength in order that she may be better* fitted to share responsibility in maintaining the peace of Europe and the world.
Recommendations
In the light of the above considerations, the following recommenda-tions, which have been communicated to the War and Navy Departments, are submitted for your approval.
1.	The Government of the United States should neither oppose the restoration of Indo-China to France, with or without a program of international accountability, nor take any action toward French over-seas possessions which it is not prepared to take or suggest with regard to the colonial possessions of our other Allies.
2.	The Government of the United States should continue to exert its influence with the French in the direction of having them effect a libera-lization of their past policy of limited opportunities for native participation in government and administration, as well as a liberalization of restrictive French economic policies formerly pursued in Indo-China.
3.	The French Provisional Government should be informed confi-dent-ially that, owing to the need of concentrating all our resources in the Pacific on operations already planned, large-scale military operations aimed directly at the liberation of Indo-China cannot be contemplated at. this time.
11. French offers of military and. naval assistance in the Pacific should be considered on their merits as bearing upon the objective of defeating Japna, as in the case of British and Dutch proposals. The fact that acceptance of a. specific proposal might serve to strengthen French claims for the restoration of Indo-China to France should not be regarded as grounds for rejection. On the contrary, acceptance of French proposals for military assistance in the defeat of Japan should be re-garded as desirable in principle, subject always to military requirements in the theater of operations.

5.	While avoiding specific commitments with regal'd to the amount or character of any assistance which the United States may give to the French resistance forces in Indo-China, this Government should continue to afford al 1 possible assistance provided it does not interfere with the requirements of other planned operations.
6.	In addition to the aid which we are able to bring from the China theater of operations to the French forces resisting the Japanese in Indo-China, the United States should oppose no obstacle to the implementation of proposals looking toward the despatch of assistance to those forces from the southeast Asia theater of operations, provided such assistance does not constitute a diversion of resources which the Combined Chiefs of Staff consider are needed elsewhere.

Accordingly, FE suggest# that no statement of American policy with re.tpcct to post—War Indochina should be communicated to the Provisional French Government at this time.
. Because the. liberation of Indochina is, in faots dependent on Amorlean defeat of Japan; because we are snarlficing blood and treasure to asnuro peace and stability in the Far East, post-war maintenance of Which Will be largely our responsibility; because Without recognition of the dynamic trends towards self-government among the poop?, e a of Asia there can be no peace and stability in the Far East and. the peoples of Southeast Asi?, may embrace ldeologien contrary to our own or develop a pan-Asiatic movement; agaimt &H wen ten pct;.— , FE boli&TOS that it Mould not be unreasonable for the United States to insist that th® French give adequate assurcnc's as to the implementing of policies in .Indochina 'Thiii tni conSidcr essential to assure pesos and stability in the Far East.

MEMORAEDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject: American Policy with Respect to Indochina
General Observations -
1.	The Japanese aggression against the French in Indochina has brought about a marked increase in the number of proposals advanced by the French for the use of French forces and resources in the Pacific.
2.	These proposals and recent military developments make it essential that the United States reach a definitive determination re-garding its policy toward Indochina.
3-	It is established American policy to aid France to regain her strength in order that she may be better fitted to share responsibility in maintaining the peace of Europe and of the world. It seems par-ticularly important that at this time the United States should draw close to France and Great Britain, the strongest Western Powers, and attempt to remove the sources of friction between the United States and France, which include French apprehensions that we are going to propose that French territory be taken away. However, in pursuing this policy, the United States must not jeopardize its increasingly important interests in Southeast Asia and must take into account the dynamic forces leading towards self government in that area since social, economic or political instability may threaten the peace of the Far East and the world.
4.	The United States Government has publicly taken the position that it recognizes the sovereign jurisdiction of France over French possessions overseas when those possessions are resisting the enemy, and has expressed the hope that it will see the re-establishment of the integrity of French territory. The surrender of Indochina to Japan, however, not only opened the way to Japanese conquest of southeastern Asia and the Indies but exposed China's southwestern flank in thc midst of it	' Japan. U t' recently there was active collaboration
on the- part of Indochina with the Japanese, but Japanese aggression in Indochina has now given rise to resistence on the part of local French and native elements.
5.	Although President Roosevelt had in the past expressed his preference that Indochina should be placed under trusteeship, he nevertheless approved a statement issued by the Secretary of State on April 3, 1945 relative to the plans approved at Yalta which carried the clear implication that Indochina would only come Under a proposed trusteeship structure through voluntary action by the French. The United States position that trusteeship should apply only to mandated and enemy territory and territories voluntarily placed under the system

by states responsible for their administration has been re-affirmed during the current discussions at San Francisco. It is abundantly clear that there is no possibility at the present time or in the foreseeable future that France will volunteer to place Indochina under trusteeship, or consent to any program of international accoun-tability which is not applied to the colonial possessions of other powers.
6.	French policies in Indochina before the war were unsatis-factory both as regards the Indochinese and as regards economic and commercial relations with other countries. There is increasing independence sentiment among the Indochinese and this movement appears to have at least the tacit support of China. There are indications, however, that the present French Government is embarking upon a new policy which is taking these factors into account. On several occasions in recent years, French authorities have issued policy statements on the future of Indochina. These follow a general trend toward greater autonomy for the French administration of Indochina but the most recent statement, that of March 24, 1945, is still, vague and indicates little progress toward the establishment of genuine self rule for the Indochinese or of an open door economic policy in Indo-china.
7.	The economic policies pursued before the war by the French administration in respect to foreign trade with China through Haiphong and over the Yunaan railway affected adversely the economic develop-ments of southwest China and foreign commerce with that region. Unless the situation is changed, this will be an increasingly important source of postwar friction.
8.	The frontier between Indochina and Thailand is also a potential source of future trouble in southeastern Asia because it does not con-form to ethnic and cultural groupings and involves conflicting historic claims.
Recommendations
In the light of the above considerations, the following recommen-dations are submitted for your approval.
1.	The Government of the United States should make known to the French Provisional Government its concern for the future peace and stability of the Far East and its views as to how French action with respect to Indochina can contribute toward the maintenance of peace and stability. To that end the draft of a proposed telegraphic instruc-tion to the American Ambassador at Paris is enclosed herewith. In this instruction the Ambassador is directed to seek the views of the French Government on five specific proposals which appear to be of chief im-portance for the future peace and stability of this area.

2.	Pending the outcome of the proposed discussions in Paris the following procedure, which is in line with the known views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be followed:
(a)	While avoiding so far as practicable unnecessary or long-term commitments with regard to the amount or character of any assistance which the United States may give to the French resistance forces in Indochina, this Government should continue to afford such ass.ista.nce as does not interfere with the requirements of other planned operations. The French Provisional Government should be informed confidentially that owing to the need for concentrating all our resources in the Pacific on operations already planned, large-scale military operations aimed directly at the liberation of Indochina cannot be contemplated at this time. American troops should not be used in Indochina except in American military operations against the Japanese.
(b)	French offers of military and naval assistance in the Pacific should be considered on their military merits as bearing on the objective of defeating Japan as in the case of British and Dutch proposals. There would be no objection to furnishing of assistance to any French military or naval forces so approved regardless of the theatre of operations from which the assistance may be sent provided such assistance does not involve a diversion of resources which the Combined or Joint Chiefs of Staff consider are needed elsewhere.

The Minister mentioned that there were two French divisions ready for immediate transportation to the Far Eash In reply to my inquiry as to whejher there are Senegalese troops among; them, he admitted that this was probably so, although there were also substantial numbers of white French. He made it clear that the French divisions could be utilized anywhere in the Far East, and there was no intention of limiting their con-, tribution lo anacking the enemy in lmlochina. 1 reiterated that this matter wpj.ild be. placed before.onr. military authorities inune-dtntely.

FOR AMBASSADOR FROM THE ACTING SECRETARY.
The President thanks you for your considered telo-grarn in regard to the problems presented by the reestablishment of French control in Indochina and the British ■	. desire to reoccupy Hongkong and fully appreciates the
difficulties in which you and General ./edemeyer may be ■ placed on account of the lack of specific directives in respect to both, of these problems thich hate been under careful study both here and in connection v?ith the discussions at Sen Francisco.	'
I hate also receited your message No. 15^3 of June 6 and regret that there has been delay in replying to yov.r earlier one owing to the study which has been required of these matters in connection with present developments at the Conference. The President has asked me to sty that there has been no basic, change in the policy in respect to these two questions ana that the present position is as follows:
The President assumes that you are familiar with the stt-teuent m-.de by the Secretary of State on April 5, 19115 with the approval of President RooseVelt in which lir. Stettinius oeclared that as a result of the Yalta ■	discussions the "trusteeship structure, it was felt,
.	should be defined to permit the placing under it of such
of the territories taken from the enemy in this war, ns might be agreed upon at a later date, end also such other territories as might voluntarily be placed under trustee- ! ship0. The position thus publicly announced hes been confirmed by the conVersations which are now taking place
in San Francisco

in San Francisco in regard to trusteeships. Throughout those discussions[the American delegation has insisted upon the necessity of providing for a progressive moasuro of self-government for all dependent peoples looking toward their eVent’ual independence or incorporation in some' form of federation according to circumstances and the ability of the peoples to assume these responsibilities. Such decisions would preclude the establishment of a trusteeship in Indochina except with the consent of tlte French Government. The latter seems unlikely. Neuer— theless it is the President’s intention at some appropriate time to ask that the French Government give some positive indication of its intentions in regard to the establishment of civil liberties and increasing measures of selfgovernment in Indochina before formulating further declarations of policy in this respect.*/
In. the meantime the President has explained to the French Foreion Minister that whereas we welcome French participation in the war against Japan the determination of the extent that it would be practical and helpful to haV© French forces join with us in such operations must be left to the Commander in Chief, United States Army Forces, Pacific. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are at present engaged in a study of the possibilities of French help along the lines of the following suggestions:
*
(a)	While avoiding so far as practicable unnecessary or long-term commitments with regard to the amount or character of any assistance which the United States may giVe to French rests-tance forces in Indochina, this Government should continue to afford such assistance as does not interfere with the requirements of other planned operations. Owing to the need for concentrating all our resources in the Pacific or. operations already planned, large-scale military operations aimed directly at the liberation of Indochina cannot, however, be contemplated at this time. American troops should not bo used in Indochina except in American military operations against the Japanese.
(b)	French offers of military and naval assistance in the Pacific should be considered on their military merits as bearing on the objectiVe of defeating Japan as in the. case of

Japanpan and wish to inform you of their views which are as follows: - 
a. While it is at present impracticable due chiefly to logistical 
difficulties for French or Netherlands armed forces to take a major part in the immediate operations in the Far East, the provision of such assistance which may be synchronized with operations will be
taken into account by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The use of such
forces will depend solely on military considerations. French or
Netherlands forces so accepted must operate under the complete control  of the commander in chief concerned.
b. In implementing this policy the Combined Chiefs of Staff undertake to give the French/Netherlands representatives timely

Operations in ths Pacific
9.	We have taken note of the plans and operations proposed 1 ■ the- United Statca Chiefs of Staff in Appendix "A.”
10.	We have considered the scope and nature of British participation in operations in the Pacific area. Our conclusions are as follows:-
a. The British Pacific. Fleet will participate as at present pJanjui b. A British very long range bomber force of 10 squadrons, incrm.-. ing to 20 squadrons when Indre airfields bcContc available, will participate. Thore is little prospect that airfield space for more U ■ 10 squadrons, of this force will become available before 1 Decern! : 1915 at the earliest.
c. We have Agreed in principle, that a Commonwealth land foi and, if possible, a small tactical air force, should take part in t' final phase of the war against Japan, subject to the satisfactory resolution of oponltiontd and other problems. In addition, some units of the British * East Indies Fleet may aIso take part.
11.	In conncetion with paragraph 10 c. above, we have agreed that the appropriate British commanders and staff should visit Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur and chaw up with the::: a plan for submission to the Combined Chiefs of Stall'.

12.	Wo have discussed the instructions that, should be issttCd to •he Supreme Allied Commander, Southeast Asin, and have agreed ..pon the terms of the dircetive in' Appendix "B.”
deallocation of Areas and Command in the Southwest Pacific and Soul! -east Asia Areas
13.	Wc have agreed in principle that that part of the Southwest pacific Area lying south of the boundary described in Appendix "C” Mould pass from United States to British command as soon as pos-.ible. The British Chiefs of Staff have undertaken to obtain the agreement of the Australian, New Zealand, and Dutch Governments ;o theSc propoaals and to investigate and report the earliest practicable •ate on which the transfer Can be effected.
1-1. Wc consider it desirable that initially Admiral Mountbatten mntrol operations undertaken in southern lndo-China since these are more closely related to those of Southeast Asia Command than to those of the China Theater. Wc are agreed that the best arrangement would be to include that portion of Inclo-China lying south of latitude 1G° north in Southeast Asia Command. This arrangement •.rould continue General Wedcmcyer’S control of that part of lndo-China which covers the flank of projected Chinese operations in China, and would enable Admiral Mountbatten to prepare the ground in the southern half of lndo-China where any initial operations by him would develop.
Wc recommend that an approach to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek4 be made by our two governments to secure his agreement to this arrangement.
At a later date it may prove to be desirable to place all or part of the remainder of lndo-China within the sphere of operations of the Southeast Asia Command.
French and Dutch Participation in the U’ar
15.	Wc have considered the arrangements which can be made for French and Dutch participation in the war against Japan and our conclusions are as follows:—
a. While it is at present impracticable due chiefly to logistical difficulties for French or NctherIands tinned forces to take a major part in the immediate operations in the Far East, the provision of Such i-sistancc which may be synchronized with operations will bo taken .to account. The USe of such forces will depend solely on military ’onsiderationS. French or NethcrhndS forces so accepted must menite under the complete control of the commander in chief mneeraed.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE:
The OSS ’representative in Kunming has tranSmitted the following information concerning the French attitude toward, the Indo-Chinese ProviSional Government. The Provisional GoVemment Was the subject Of cur two memoranda Of 21 August.
The French GOVcrnment has decided to adopt a paSsive diplomatic attitude tcivard the reoccupation of lndo-China because 01 their inability to make an entry with a powerful show Of arms. A committee Of three haS peen appointed by the French GOvernment in Paris, composed of the chief Of the Kunming DGE9 /French Intelligence Service?, the Minister Of COlOnies, and the Administrator General of Colonies. Its missiOn is to cOntact Annamite leaders and negotiate with them-on terms favOrable to the IndoChinese, according tn Major Sainieny, who Will represent the coramittee in Hanoi. The French policy will be one Of liberal administration in the capacity Of advisors to the Indo-Chinese Provisional Government, Io'be established by the Kuomintang An-namite and the Vietriinh, which together form a committee Of national liberation. (The Vietminh is a 100^ Cosnunist party, With a membership of approximately 20/j of the actiVe political native element. The Kuomintang Party comprises six minority parties and a score of independent ones.) The French Comniutee has been charged with the task Of negotiating directly lvibh Indo-Chinese leaders and deciding on the best modus operand!. It has full pOWerS of signing treaties in the name 01 France. The committee will in turn ^report to Paris, which retains the prerogative Of' making minor aniendntents t-O ths general agreeHienb. Ardlr.iii'te leaders" in Kunming and representativeS Of the Central LiberaUOn Committee recently from 'Hanoi,.have expressed a desire to bring Imoin ZInnain?7 in lndo-China under the status of an American profjQG'toFcvt©? and nrs hoping '6000 oho US 1/5.11 i’li/ei’ccd© Uich the United Nations for the exclusion of the French, as well as

Well-informed Breach and AnnameSO sources state that the Central Committee has been negotiating with local Japanese mill' thorities for the purchase.of guns and anmunition, with the intent Of using them, Should either the French cr Chinese attempt 1q reoccupy their areas. The Indo-Chinese fear a Chinese reoc-cupation because they feel t-he Chinese will becOwe squatters living off the land, pillaging, raping, and looting. The French concur in this OpiniOn only in SO far as 'bo Wish exclusiVe ad-miniSuratiVe rightn for themselves. The leader of the Annamite Kuomintang Party in China and a direct representative of the Central Liberation. COmmittes in Hanoi, made 'the following statement On 15 August:
”Should the French attempt to return 10 IndO-China with the intention Of governing the cOuntry, and to act once more as OppresSors, the IndO-Chinese people are prepared to fight to the end againet any sueh reoccupation. On the Other hand, .if tHey came as friends to establish commerce, industry and without aspirations to governmental rule, they will be welcomed the same as any other foreign pOWer. The Central Committee Wishes to make knom tO the United States GoverniAsnt that the Tncto-ChineSC people first of all desire the independence Of IndO-China, and are hoping that the Unit S StatOS, aS a champion of democracy, will assist her in securing this indt ” oce in the folic ing manner: (1) Prohibiting, Or not assisting the French to enter Info-Chins; (2) keeping the Chinese under control, in order that loo-tiro pillaging will be kept to a minimum; (3) ssnd-ing technical advisors to assist the Indo-Chinese to exploit the resources 01 the land; and (4) developing those industries thai lndo-China is capable of supporflingi
(lIn conclusion, the Indo-Chinese would, like to be placed on the same status as the Philippines for an undetermined period. n ■

6S57. Speaking of Indochina Chauvel *T said that when trouble
s! Jeaii Chauvel. Secretary-General to the French Minister for Foreign AfIairs. with the Annamites broke out de Gaulle had been urged by the French Mission in India 10 make some sort of policy statement announcing' France's intention to adopt a far-reaching progressive policy designed to give the native population much greater authority, responsibility and represent at ion in govt. De Gaulle considered the idea but rejected it because in the state of disorder prevailing in Indochina he believed that no such policy could be implemented pending restoration of French authority and would therefore just be considered by everyone as "merely more fine words". Furthermore de Gaulle and the Foreign Minister believe, that the present situation is still so confused and they have so little information really reliable on the overall Indochina picture Ilmt such plans ami thoughts as they held heretofore may have to be very thoroughly revised in the light of recent developments.
Despite the fact that the French do not feel that they can as yet make any general statements outlining specific future plans for lmlo-china, (Tminel says that they hope "very soon'' to put into operation in certain areas programs inchiding local elections which will be designed to grant much greater authority and greater voice in nffnirs to the natives. This he said would be a much belter indication of the sincerity of French intentions than any policy .statement.
In this connection he said ilmt Admiral d’ArgenEieu is in touch

with the King of Cambodia and the hitter has indicated that he has no hostility 10 the French (but on the contrary apparently fears both Annamite and Siamese aspirations). The French hope soon to negotiate an agreement with him which will result in the granting of much greater responsibility and authority to the Cambodians. He mentioned specifically that there would be many more natives integrated into the local mlministfative services and it was also hoped ilmt local elections could soon he held. The French he. said intend to follow the same procedure in Laos when the situation permits and eventually also in Ammin m..l Tonkin.

Chauvel said the French intend to embody the. results of these separate ngreenients into si general program for all of lndoehimI.
Insofar as the Chinese are concerned Chauvel said that he does not believe they arc encouraging the Annntniterf who have a hearty dislike of tlie Chinese nor does he believe they have any territorial aspirations in lndochina. On the. other hand he thinks the Chinese are definitely t rying to get the maximum “squeeze" from the French in the form of occupational costs for their army, el cetera (my 6S1'», November 2(i.3!')

Furthermore, the Chinese are desirous of obtaining title to tlrn northern section of the lndochinese Yunnan Rail-way.

Asked when, in his opinion, the Chinese would get out of Indochina, General Gallagher said that General Lu Han l/had told him the
7/ Commanding General of Chinese armed forces in Indochina.
Chinese would move out when the job given them by the Allies was completed. General Gallagher said he thought they really intend to do this although the whole matter depends upon the removal of the Japanese. To date, shipping for this purpose has not been available but now it is understood that United States bottoms will be used. The question is, therefore, when will such ships be allocated. General Gallagher said he had recommended to General Wedemeyer d/that high priority should be given such allocation.
8/ Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer, Commanding General, U.S. Forces, China Theater, and concurrently Chief of Staff, China Theater.
There are some 20 to 30 thousand Japanese in Haiphong and the Do Son Peninsula. No political settlement can be reached in Indochina until the Chinese move out and they cannot do that until the Japanese are repatriated. General GalIagher added that he thought US army teams would have to be put into Indochina to concentrate and prepare the Japanese for evacuation.
General Gallagher was asked whether he knew of any arrangement whereby French forces moving into the north would overlap departing Chinese forces. He replied that in December Sainteny 9/said that no French would enter until
9/ Jean Sainteny, French Commissioner of Tonkin and North Annam, the Chinese left. General Gallagher thought the French were probably not getting very far in negotiating with the Chinese on problems connected with their removal. Unless in the meantime something has been arranged between the French and the Chinese, the French would probably infiltrate overland from the south rather than land in force in northern ports.
General Gallagher pointed out that little love was lost between the Chinese and thc French; that the presence of the American group in Hanoi restrained anti-French Chinese action; and that he himself had influenced General Lu Han to bring Sainteny and Ho Chi Minh together and confront both with a strong directive that order must be maintained. The existence of a vacuum in the north with neither French nor Chinese troops present would be extremely dangerous, as the Annamese would react strongly against all French in thc area, who would be helpless in protecting themselves. To take over successfully, the French would need a sufficient force to cover the whole north. One or two modern French divisions could, in General Gallagher’s opinion, defeat the Annamese.
In response to the question whether the French could do more than take key cities, he admitted that the Annamese would take to the hills and continue guerrilla warfare. Even in Saigon, he pointed out, things are far from peaceful despite British and French claims to the contrary. Establishment of French control could be speeded up if they were able to make large-scale air drops throughout the north. The Annamese, however, are well organized and, so far as small arms go, arc quite well armed, although they havc no navy, shore batteries and probably little artillery.

The qut siton wns raised whether the French mission in Hanoi was in fad negotiating with Ho Chi Minh. General Gallagher replied that the Viet Minh Provisional Government was at first willing to negotiate; then in October, after de Gaulle's.pronouncements on
’’Gen. Cbaries <!<■ Gaidlr. Prestitelit of the Provisional Governiueut of the Republic of Frame until .Jammry 26.
colonial policy, the Aniiamese refu-ed to negotiate with thc French and reacted vigorously against all French muionals in Hanoi. The Chinese may succeed in putting in a less anti Freneh Annamese government so that m^ot'a1 ion might go forward. All French efforts to stimulate a palace revolution against Ho were of no avail.

Genial Gallavhersaid ''mt FanPenv had told him he expected peaceful agreement Let ween the French and the Annamese would be reached by nemcintion.
General GaUevher was nHced how effective the Viet Minh admin-istratiop would be w’th neither French nor Chinese forces present. TEe replied that on the whole bp wa- impressed by the remarkably effective tnnanleFe administration. There was an able personnel; they were aD enthrsinstic and vovnw. bn* there were too few of them. Whatever tlu 'r teehnica1 skill, thev perlums lack executive ability and experience smce >hc technical services in ITanoi’were at first very well run but oTadimliv deteriorated 'rrained people for the government and at the municipal level ace lm-k’ny. In General Galhcvher's opinion the Annamese are not vet rea<lv for self-government and in full-fledged comnetition with other tuitions they would "lose their shirts". However, the demand for indeuelvlenee is widesnread and even in the villages the peasants refer to tho example of I he Philippines.
Ho is wilIhvr to connerate with G'c-t Britain. USSR, or the United States and would perhaps even settle for French tniebure if that were subordinated to control bv the n’her nations. French control alone, however, will be stion<>ly resisted. The deep-seated hatred for the French has hppn fanned by e?cecdin/rlv clever Viet Minh Dromup’ndn.
General Gallajihor was asked whether the Annamese were realistic regarding their ability to stal’d nn against French military force. While they are too en’lmsmstie and too naive, he said, they probably know th::t thev will be licked They are strong on parades and te-itenite their willimyness “to furhl to the last man", but they would be slaughtered and they have been told that anil probably know it. The Annamese would, be no match for forces with modern arms even if they themselves have some, which they may have since the Chinese found m> Japanese roHnur artillerv and numerous .Tun-n'e-e anti-aircimft guns seem to have completely disappeared.

General Gallagher was asked whether the pre-ence of Frem-h hostages in the north would restrain French forces when they enter the region. He poitded out tha’ only a few French civilian.' had been removed by air. All the res*, l/esides fome five thousand di.-armed French troops, were still to be removed. The Chinese cannot hike them out nor would Ln Han even permit their evacuation to the Do Son I’eninsula. Their presrnce hml been a constant restraining influence rm Sainteny. Asked whether the Anname.-e would let these French be evacuated, General Gallagher replied that they would have to if the Chinese were still there, but that there French natinnls would be a real problem if 'he Chinese were moved out. The American Army group had to exert considerable pressure on the Chinese to get them to,give any frectlcm at all to French civilians in Haiphong. Hue and other centers beside-- Hanoi. However, the Chinese and French alone had arranged for shipments of fond from the south. The American group, incidentally, h:id to intervene to prevent the monopoly by the French of s. ch food cr of food distributcd by the U.S. Army. The French nationals could be evacuated from ITongai and Tonrane by the United States when the Japanese were removed if the Chinese, would concentrate them at those ports. However. General Gallagher noted, that would place us in a position of working against the Annamese.
Originally, General Gallagher explained, the Ftench expected the United States to play the same role in the north that thc British were playing in I be south, ulten they found us neutml they became more and more antagonirtic and did everything possible to persuade United States personnel to favor the French position. They had no appre-ciafion of thc actual help which the American group gave to the prisoners-of war and seme of thc civilian French in the form of food, medical aid, and so on. The Annamese, too, expected American help originally, having been thoroughly indoctrinated with the Atlantic Clisuter and other ideological pronorncements. Tn our neutral role we were thus a disappointment to both sides.
In response to ;t question, General Gallagher gave his opinion that Lu Han would be faithful to Chungking although as governor of Yunnan he would also be infh.etu-erl to mainrain us fully as possible relations I.etween Yunnan and north Indochina which would be profitable to him. ‘
General Gallacher said Ilmt the half dozen or >< top F'rench iiiHi-tary officers held by the Japtuie«e had been returned to France shortly after Sainteny reached Hanoi. He did not know wlmt bad lmpp-necI to Decoux.’1

Sainteny su’d that Annamese in Cochin China would probably prefer to remain French Colony rather come under northern 'nnune-e Government. In this connection ITo Chi Minh said Ilmt French officials had conferred with him but that they were vague in their comments and had avoided the real issues of Annamese independence so tlmt lie had asked them to get specific terms from Paris which would make dear whether the French really offered Annnmes° independence or were merely using new language Io describe usual French control Annamese affairs.

French here give imprersion they would not object to referendum in Cochin Chita. However, they indicate they would not care to allow complete freedom for Viet Nam agents there. Their objection is that such agents would resort to terrorism to influence vote. (There seems tobecertain amount of justification for French contention. Viet Nam police hate been treating pto-FTeiiclt Viet Xamcse and Metis with French nationality rather severely in Tonkin.)
Outcome of any refi'lendum would probably be largely detennined by conditions under which it would be held. French fee! Cochin China would vote SOW for autonomy. Viet Nam claim Cochin China would vote SO/E for incoq>oimtion with Viet Nam. Both claim[s] have an unspoken promise [///■< wArt] (hat claimant could establish conditions of referendum.

KESTBtCTED	Paris, July 7,194G—1 p. m.
[Received July 7—12: .39 p. m.]
3323. Opening of Franco-Viet Nam conference at Fontainebleau yesterday brought to an apparent end pre-conference honeymoon period during which French and Indochinese officials had rivaled with each other in displays of Franco-Viet Nam friendship.
After long wail for Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu supposed to preside over conference, unexpected announcement that “Admiral was indisposed" created uneasiness and rumors to effect Viet Xam delegates had vetoed presidency of Thierry d'Argenlieu who, in their eyes, “typified French imperialism".
Max Andre, head of French delegation, assuming Presidency at last moment, delivered innocuous speech of welcome and declared conference open. Mr. Phan Van Dong, head of Viet Nam delegation, immediately protested against this unilateral assumption of the chair of the direction of the proceedings. In a fighting speech which Contrasted sharply with platitudes of Andre's address, he went immediately to the core of the worst difliculties which the conference will have to face. In sharp words, he protested against "the inntiIation of the Viet'Nam Motherland" through the creation of an independent state of Cochin China outside of the Viet Nam. He went on to accuse the ■ French authorities in Indochina of having violated the accords of Dalat of March 6, 1946 aml of having used these accords to penetrate, peacefully in the north while military operations were being carried on in the south and in the interior.
This unexpected offensive of the Viet Nam delegation on the first day has created a sensation. Independent and impartial Combat. genuinely interested in colonial problems, headlines Viet Nam accusation across the entire first page and recognizes French mistakes made in Indochina. Communist TTumanite frankly sides with Viet Nam. Socialists royulnirc gives fair anil impartial account in a vein sympathetic to Viet Xam. MRP. Aabc regrets “that F'rench goodwill did not find a corresponding echo". Tn the conservative and Nationalist papers there is literally an explosion of wrath against Viet Nam delegation. Increasingly Leftist but always liltra-Nationaltst Ordre terms Phan Van Dong's statements “shocking" aml already blames Viet Nam for any future breakdown in negotiations. All these papers play up violations of Dalat agreement by (he Viet Nani nnd underline assassinations, kidnapping and rape of Europeans as justification of continued military operations by French expeditionary corps.
On the whole conference had gotten off to bad star!. Viet Xam leaders also express their regret that conference “of .such considerable importance" should be held outside of Paris.
Interesting.to note that yesterday afternoon conversation held between TIo Chi Minh, Viet Nam President, nnd Algerian deputies of friends of manifest group headed by Ferhat Abbas (my despatch 5571 of July 3 '*) on similarity between problems facing Algeria and

coxfipexTUL	Paris, August 2,1M6—6 p. in.
[Received S: 1G p. tn.]
3801. Viet Nam delegation at Fontainebleau conference yesterday broke off negotiations on ground that French have violated March 6 aecord by convoking new conference at Dalat. Head of delegation tjlle^ed that French intend to use new Dalat conference (to which Viet Nam was not invited) to engineer their own statute for Indo-Chinese federation and to fix future of Cochin China and other areas claimed by Viet Xam. ITe added that Fontainebleau conference is not terminated but only suspended until French clear up this "equivocal" situation. Delegation will remain at FontainebIeau for time' being and is prepared to maintain contact with French delegates on unofficial basis.
This decision has been received by press as a kind of bomb shell although reports had been current tlmt conference was entering a critical stage and tlmt he fZZol. Chi Minh, would clepsut soon for Indo China. Press reaction lias followed expected lines with left-wing organs jiistifvin”. decision while right-wing aml r;uli< al papers accuse Viet Nam of blackmail and insist that Ffence has perfect right toconsult other peoples of Indochina in parallel Dalat conference.
Radical Anrore demands tlmt France shall not “abdicate" in Indochina and adonis Eyoqne line in charging tlmt "other imperialisms” are tit iIiMnir Viet Nam forown purposes.
Monde insists that Fiance is playing role of impartial arbiter and must not retreat before ultimatum. Monde also takes olT gloves with, respect to TTo Chi Minh, recalling that he was friend of Doriot and that in 1045 he publicly expressed determination to “break oIT all re-lations with French people'!
conftbrnttat.
Among defenders of Vid Nam Communist Tlumnnitc is most out-spoken. Independent's Combat continues to stress “the flagrant dissonance" between French statements in Palis and French policy in Indochina which has recently amounfcd to a "provocation'’. Combat expects serious repercussions in Indochina.
Caught in the middle, both Socialists and MRP are embarrassed and worried. Populaire blames Admiral cTArgenlieu for unjusti-fiable policy which must be repudiated by French Government. I/Aube, on other hand, takes aggrieved [stand?] and insists Dalat conference is entirely proper under March G accord.
Hamlet, one of Foreign Office delegates nt Fontainebleau, admits situation is serious but believes conference will resume in a week or 10 days. ITe insists new Dalat conference is only exploratory and consultative. Baudet once Again indicated French officials are not particularly anxious to speed up work of Font iiinchl can conference and are quite willing for relations with Viet Xiim to continue under present agreement until the pacification of Indochina and particularly Cochin China is completed. He added that security situation in Cochin China is more serious than French public is aware.

Memorandum by the Chief of thc Dirixion of Southeast Asian Affairs (Moffat) to the Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs (Vincent)
[Washington.] August 9, 10-16.
Recent (levelopmems indicate that the French are moving to regain a large measure of their control of Indochina in violation of the spirit of the March 0 convention. Thc evidence, as set forth below, Suggests tlmt the French arc attempting- to train their objective by manoeuvres designed to confine and weaken Viet Nani. In the event that Viet Xatn decides to resist these encroachments, which is by no means unlikely, widespread hostilities may result.
The chief opposition to the reestabHshnient of French rule in Tndo-china has all along come from the Annamese, who inhabit the three east coastal provinces of Tonkin, Annam, and Coehinchina, which once comprised the Kingdom of Annam. The populations of (he other two countries of Indochina—Cambodia and Laos—are not in a high state of political development or in any condition seriously to resist French control. A modus rirendi Let ween the French and the Annamese was achieved in thc preliminary convention of Minch C, 1946, by which the Annamese "Republic of Viet Nam" was recognized as a free state within the Indochinese Federation and the Viet Nam Government declared its readiness to receive the French Army. The convention left for future settlement two crucial problems: (he status of Viet Nam in its external relations, and the geographical extent of Viet Nam. On the former point, the provisional agreement stated that "each contracting patty will take all necessary measures . .
“omission indicated in the original.
to create the favorable atmosphere necessary for an immediate open-intr of amicable and free negotiations. These negotiations will bear particularly upon diplomatic relations between the Viet Nam and foreign states, the future status of Indochina. French economic and cultural interests in Viet Nam." On the latter point the agreement stated that "with respect to the bringhur together of he three (provinces). the French Government [•ledges itself to ratify the decisions taken by the populations consulted by referendum." The crux of the present situation lies in the apparent intention of the French to settle both matters to their own advantage and without reference to Viet Nam.

The hostility of the Annamese toward the French began tn mount to its present intensitv when tl>» flinch Rn June 1 announced the malign rat ion of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Coehinchinn. Annamese leaders hml long emphasized their view that Hie inclusion of Cnehinchiiia in Viet Num was a matter of life and death to their country. Cochinehina, ii may be mentioned, contains the important mercantile cities of Saigon and Cholon, includes the month.- of thc Mekong, and is the richest province in Indochina. Called thc Southern Province by the Viet Xaniese, it is racially indistinct ftom Tonkin and Annam. Statements by the French that the referendum in Cochinchina (as pledged in the March 6 convention) would still be held failed Io reassure Viet Xtun leaders, who pointed out that such a referendum could not possibly be fair owing to the suppression by the French of pro-Vict Xam political parties and of all anti-French opinion. SEA's information tends to substantiate this point of view.
Tension between the French and (he Annamese reached its present pitch when the Flench on August 1 convened a conference at Dalat (in southern Annam) to which the Royal Governments of Cambodia
I	and Emos, (he Government of the autonomous Republic of Cochin-
china, and the native peoples of southern Annam and high plateau of Indochina (but not Vie! Num, recognized by the French as part of the. Indochina Federation and French Union) to send delegates to “study the flamework of the French Union". Subsequently pub-lishecl agenda of the conference indicated tlmt the salient aspects of the Indochina Federation would also be deliberated. As an immediate result of this conference, the Viet Nam delegation which had been discussing the future relation Let ween Franc? aml Viet Nam with the representatives of the French at Fountainebleau since July fi an-nonnced that they were suspending negotiations until the French should have cleared up the “equivocal" situation which had been created. The head of the Viet Nam delegation, who had opened the conference with a violent blast against French policies, charged that the French were now trying to engineer their own statute for the Indochinese Federal ion and their own settlement of the stains of Cochinchina and other areas claimed by Viet Nam. The view of Consul Saigon is not very different. Me gave as his opinion that a front against Viet Xam was in the making, that the states pnrtici-pafing in the Dalat Conference were at least tacitly recognized as-free states by the French, and tlm< France and these free states are now determining the status of the Indochinese federation without reference to Viet Nam. In his view it indicated double-dealing on the part of thc French, and he reported that the French Commissioner for Cochinehina had forced the issue by threatening to resign unless his policy is carried out. Nothing ha® been said at the conference about a referendum. Finally, Consul Saigon added that he had learned that representatives of the southern regions of (he Province of Ammm (which has always been claimed Ly Viet Nam) will pcti-tion for inclusion of their teritories in Cocliinchina. Tn view of thc completeness of the agenda of the Dalat Conference, which covers the essenti;'.! framework of the Indochinese federation, and in view of the deliberate exclusion of Viet Nam from the conference, the eondn-ion is ine.-r.-tpab’e that the French are endeavoring to whittle down Viet Nam aml to se'tle the future form of organization of ludo-
I	china with those who may be expected to be amenable to French
influence.

Annamese reaction to French moves has been sharp, and following the suspension of the Fontainebleau negotiations, there were pro-Viet Nam niiinifestiitions in Saigon. The amlm.-h of a French supply column near Hanoi by Annamese soldiers, during which the French suffered 52 casualties (one of thc worst of many incidents during the past several months), may have been related to the opening of the Dalat Conference.
While it is to he doubted that the French will allow the Fontainc-blean Conference to break down completely, Embassy Paris quotes Baudet as having stated tlmt French oflicials are in no hurry to speed up negotiations until the pacification of Indochina, and particularly of Cochinchina, has been completed. In this connection, Consul Saigon reports tlmt more troops are arriving in Indochina and (hat the French military position has grown much stronger. Meanwhile. the Saigon press has been carrying vitriolic attacks against Viet Nani. Since this press is completely controlled by the French, there vvotiEd appear to be no official objection to thisline.
In his latest report, Consul Hanoi states that there now exists an imminent danger of an open break between the French and" Viet Nam. He adds tlmt a rupture of relations would probably Le followed by a period of anarchy and tlmt, although the French could quickly overrun the country, they could not—as they themselves admit—pacify it except through a long and bitter military operation.
In conclusion, it is SEA'S view that the Annamese are faced with the choice of a cosily submission to the French or of open resistance, and that the French may be preparing to resort to force in order to secure their position throughout Indochina. It may not be advisable for this Government to take official notice of this situation during the Peace Conference,5" but the Department should be prepared, SEA

342. At Dalat conference, which closed on 14th, delegations were reasonably unanimous as to desired structure and scope of federation and relationship of member states with federal ion and each other. Cochin-Chinese delegations vowed (delegation showed] more independence of thought than other delegations and followed less slavishly French pattern for Indochina of future. This is part to impress Cochin-Chinese and to help lessen belief pre.-ent Cochin-Chinese Govt only a puppet, but as previously reported members of this govt sincerely want more freedom of action and less domination by Fieneh. While findings and recommendations of conference not binding they appear to be reasonable basis for future, but it is certain Viet Xam will find much fault therewith, as they fall short of the larger degree of independence tlesited by that state. Growing belief High Commissioner and Commissioner for Cochin-China 57 may go as their policy subjected incrensin'r criticism here and reportedly in France, particularly in calling Dalat conference lmowing Viet Nam could object and in creating Cochin-China Govt without reference to referondmn. 1 Towever, (hey argue no reason why French Viet Nam negotiat ions should decide ftu me without reference to other state- and that necessary atmo pheie for referendum is lacking (latter probably true as any referendum under existing conditions micht well increase partisan activities). Unquestionably both officials are le-s liberal in views re nahve peoples than when first came to French Tudor-Lina. Next move will be submission Du’at niono-als to French Govt and atfemnt to reconcile proposals with Fon'ainehlpni' agenda. However, regardless soundness many these prono-aL. clinieuh foresee any great degree success in above so long a- Cochin China stays apart from Viet Nam, which is one point of French policy in French Indochina.

Snt: I have Ilie honor to report that at his request I received a visit, this morning from II. 1 To Chi Minh, “President of the Republic of Viet-Nam”, who confirmed the news published in the local press that the Fontnineblean negotiations between the Vie’-Nam representatives and thc French representatives have practically broken clown and the Viet-Nam delegation will be returning to Indochina within the next few days.
The principal point on which they failed to reach agreement con-cems Cochin China: the T'reneh represonfatives insist that Cochin China lie an "independent'’ entity in an Indochinese federation, while the Viet Xam renrpcei't;1 fives insist that one central .government in Indochina must dominate the whole country. He said that he and his nnrtv smpiivd io Vipt-Xam “independence" in an "Union Fnm-caise". He said tlmt they would like to receive some “help" from us, but did not specify what he meant by that. ITe took occasion to say that he was nnf a communist.
From the ventTi'l ftizzit'ess of his remarks. I gathered tlmt he would like us *o r-et into the name and he would be very pleased if lm could use us in ‘•ome way or other in his future negotiations with the French nuthorii ies.

374. Both Chirac and Chief of Surete have informed me incteascfd] Communistic activities in French Indochina are disquieting. Tnter-cepfed letters indicate Chinese Communists are entrenched in Chinese centers Silicon and Haiphong and that Annamites chiefly in Tonkin and Annam, but also to certain extent in Cochin China, are receiving much Communist propaganda. They feel Viet Nam leaders not entirely responsible for this apparent trend but point out those leaders have Communist training and leanings. Chirac added tlmt one difficulty in handling Communist problem is impossibility using word “CommnniFt" in regard *o this movement as strength of Communist party in France preclndes any unfavorable mention. Both believed continuance uncertainty Freneli-Viet Nani relations despite signing provisional agreement m will contribute to such activities but stressed
“ See t'etegnun 4G71. in feu.
Communists are already in French Indochina (no Russians) and close watch over developments must bo maintained as agencies outside French Indochina are undoubtedly supplying propaganda.

They were also unsuccessful in having written into agreement provisions for disarmament of resistance elements in Cochin China but Botssezon claims it was orally understood with Ho Chi Minh that such elements would have chance of either retiring to Tonkin with arms and baggage or giving tip arms if remaining in Cochin China.

“If they allow spread of democratic libel-ties, release political prisoners, and stop attacking my people, things will go well for them in Tonkin. Otherwise the commissions (provided for in modus ri-vendi) will not accomplish much", he said.
He added fighting in south would not stop unless French applied agreement locally.	.

The Vietnam Government is in control of a -mall Communis' croup possibly in indirect touch with Moscow and direct touch with Yenan. A nationalist group is utilizing CmmmuiHt party techniques and discipline with which they are familiar. The people are cnnscrva-tive landowners and aUcmpir to conimmtize the country are secondary and would await successful operation of a nationalist state.

clear that with a different French commander al Haiphong than Colonel Itches, who is notorious for graft and brutality and who hits admit ted that he cannot cont rol his own troops, the trouble might have been confined to the original incidents.
According to the French, the Vietnamese enlarge their claims after each agreement and are so impraetieaI and doctrinaire that all conversations are inetl’ectual. The Vietnamese feel that the French renege on each agreement and are trying to reestablish control. ITow-ever, both say they have approximately the same objectives, although Giap says Vietnam opposes a political Indochinese federation but favors a federation dealing with common economic problems. Mollar has mentioned to the French three apparent basic troubles: (//) complete mutual distrust, (6) failure of the F'rench to resolve their own views on "free state within Ft ench Union", (c) almost childish Vietnamese attitude and knowledge of economic questions aml vague groping for “independence". Agreement cannot be reached by trying to reach accords on incident<tl problems. Basic Vietnam powers and relations with France must first be established. Xot only new faces are needed but neutral good offices or even mediation may be essential.

FWashixotox.] December 2-'L 1040.
The serious implications of the fighting between the F'rench aml the Vietnamese which took place in the Tonkinese towns of Haiphong and Lang.-mi during the week of November 2e 27 were noted in a memorandum to you of November 2G.*U! It was feared at that time
x Not printed.
that a showdown by force was in the making. This now appears to have eventuated. For the past six days, open war has been raging in Tonkin and at several points in Annam. The Vietnamese Government has fleil lIunni and the French are endeavoring to clear the city of remainin'? Vietnamese guerillas with planes and tank-. Vietnamese Casualties durin'r the past month are probably now well over 1,000. Although French casualties have been far lighter, Sainteny (Commissioner for Tonkin and northern Annam) was himself seriously wounded four days ago.
Yon may w;sh to make the following points when you see Ambassador Bonne: this afternoon:
1.	Wc are deeply concerned by the outbreak of war in Tonkin and Annam and by the apparent severance of most of the contacts between the French nnd the Vietnamese and are fully aware of the unhappy position in which the French have been placed :
•2. We tire oTaHficd by the news that M. Moutet (Minister for Over-seas France) is nroeeeding immediately by air to Indochina to obtain first-hand information on the situation:
3.	We ore it'rere that such unsettled comT'lops as now prevail in northern lmlochina offer provocation to outside intel Terence and are disturbed lest:
a. The conflict 1 e brought up before the Security Council a- a threat to peace:
l>. Other powers ntfemnt pome form of intervenHon, in wlneh con-ncct'on 't ma'- be noted that the Chinese press has renor’ed that the dispatch of Chinese Moons (n the pre;’ is bohur considered owing to the' heavy losses sustained by Ihe local Chinese in the November fighting;
For your information:
Although 'he French in Indochina have made far-reacllinc paper-concessions >o the V'Otname-v desire for pntrmomy. French actions on the scene lmve been din'e.ed toward whittling down the powers and thc territori.'l extent of thc Vietnam "free state". This, nn■■■“.?. the Vietnamese have coiithmed 10 resist. Al the same time, the French themselves adm't that thev lack the military strmmth to reeniujtmr the country. Tn brief, with made:me forces, with public opinion slmrnlv at odds, with a governmcnt refubrrrl lttreely iimfl'ei tive throwb iii'-'nm1 division, the French Imre tried 10 accomplish in InrUehinn what a Hrnr^ and tmitcil Britnni has found it unwise to nttemnt in Burma.

Tn connection with the possibility of Chinese intervention in Indochina, the Chinese Embassy in London has approached the Foreign Office to nrono.-e joint Chinerc-British intervention in Indochina aml the Chinese Embassy in Paris Ims approached our Emlm—y in Taris to propose Clfnese-British-American intervention. Il is believed that the Chinese Embassy here may unprr.ach us to the same purpose. If so. il is considered that we should rely as the British replied, to the effect that Moutet is on mute to Indochina Io review the situation, tlmt the French line in Indochina will probably be clarified as.French internal poi:tics emerge from their present eon fusion, and tlmt an offer of nmd'at'on at this time would probably be resented and . rejected by the French.

PARIS. 6586
The Under Secretary asked Bonnet to call yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation in Indochina.
Mr. Acheson said that we are deeply concerned by the outbreak of hostilities in Tonkin and Annam and are fully aware of the unhappy situation in which the French find themselves. We had anticipated such a situation developing in NoVernber and eVents haVe confirmed our fears. While v;e have no wish to offer to mediate under present conditions wc do want the French GOVT to know that we are ready and willing to do anything which it might consider helpful in the circumstances. We have been gratified to learn of Moutet's mission end have confidence in his moderation and broad Viewpoint. J’e believe however that thc situation is highly inflammatory and if present unsettled conditions continue, there is a possibility that other powers might attempt to bring the matter up before the Security Council. If this happens, as in the case of Indonesia, the question will arise whether the matter is one of purely French internal concern or a situation likely to disturb the peace.
Other powers might likewise attempt some form of intervention as has been suggested in the Chinese press. We would be opposed to such steps, but from every point of View it seems important that the question be settled as soon as possible. Mr. Acheson added that he Wondered whether the French would attempt to reconquer the country through military force which was a step that the British had found unv’ise to attempt in Burma.

Bonnet said that he had little direct info With regard to the present situation in Indochina but referred to Leon Blum’s speech in the-Assembly this morning. He Summarized important points of thc speech which he said clearly indicated that Blum's policy is to settle the question as far as .-possible by conciliatory means and that this was the purpose of Mouret's visit. He said that Blum had reiterated that French policy is to assure the independence (Within the French empire) of Viet Ham and complete self GOVT. It was unfortunate that it had been impossible up to the present to implement the far reaching concessions embodied in the French agreement with Viet Nam.
He said that personally he Would be surprised if the Chinese brought the question up before the Security Council at this time for he felt that the Nanking GOVT was sympathetic to the French position in Indochina. He concluded by saying that he v/ould inform his GOVT of our friendly interest and of our deep concern oyer the situation and let us know the reaction from Petris.

In spite any misunderstanding Which might have arisen in minds French in regard to our position concerning Indochina they must appreciate that we have fully recognized France’s soVereign position in that area and we do not wish to haVe it appear that we are in any way endeavoring undermine that position, and French should know it is our desire to be helpful and we stand ready assist any appropriate v/ay we can to find solution for Indochinese problem. At same time we cannot shut our eye? to fact that there are two sides this problem and that our reports indicate both a lack French understanding of other side (more in Saigon than in Paris) and continued existence dangercusly outmoded colonial outlook and methods in area. Furthermore, there is no escape from fact that trend of times is to effect that colonial empires in XIX Century sense are rapidly beccming thing Of paste Action Brit in India and Burma and Dutch in Indonesia are outstanding examples this trend, and French themselVes took cognizance of it both in new Constitution and in their agreements with Vietnam.

CIG
POL SIR:
I hav5 the honor to refer to my telegram number 286 of September 1.1, 8 a.m. and to report further on the speech delivered by EMILE BOLLAERT, High Commissioner of France for Indo China. There are enclosed five copies of the speech as published by "L’Entente" in a supplement to its regular daily edition.
The site selected by Mr. Bollaert was HADONG, a provincial capital which lies 10 miles southeast of Hanoi, and which was, for a time, head-quarters of the Viet Nam Government after its flight from Hanoi in December, 1946. Hadong apparently was chosen as the place for the speech that M. Bolleart might make reference to "this razed city of Tonkin, in ruins still haunted by memories of terror". Robert Sherrod of "Time" had previously described it as "probably the most thoroughly war-wrecked city in the world."
The speech itself was delivered at about 5 p.m. in a public square. Around M. Bollaert, when he spoke, were gathered the several hundred civilians (white and Vietnamese) and the many military officers who had been invited. Some 1,500 Vietnamese, largely peasant women and children, were kept behind ropes set up to form a square in the center of which was the rostrum that the Vietnamese guerrillas had tried to burn the evening previous.
This speech represents the most important decla -ation of French policy that has been made in the last year. M. Bollaert, it will be re-called, was originally named High Commissioner for Indo China, replacing Admiral THIERRY D'ARGELLIATI in March. He arrived in Indo China early in April, and subsequently returned to Paris in June.
He was in Saigon again in late July and shortly thereafter revealed to the press that he intended to deliver a major policy declaration in
COPY

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
Tonkin in the course of the next month. He came to Hanoi on August 7, 1947. The Ramadier Government, at that time, faced the difficult questions of the Statute of Algeria and the Municipal Election law and was under attack from within its own party. Bollaert, instead of delivering his speech, when the government.....No less than four "conseils restrients des Ministres" ard one full "Conseil", plus a series of private interviews between Bollaert, the Generals de Pellet and Valluy, and Ramadier were needed to settle the final form of the speech, which I am informed, was much changed from the original version.
The speech, then, was word by word and sentence by sentence laboriously assembled by the Ramadier Government, and is the logical conclusion of France policy as pursued in Northern Indo China for the past two years. For as the French military position in Tonkin has improved militarily, so in almost exact ratio has declined their willingness to make concessions. M. Bollaert's speech represents a definite retreat from the French position taken in the March 6, 1946, Accords, and indeed its terms on their face are no more liberal than the 1884 Treaty of the Protectorate.
Stripped of its verbiage, the speech constituted an oblique offer to the Vietnamese people to bring forth a "representative government" which would accept the terms offered by M.- Bollaert on which there was to be no "bargaining" as this "would be in truth unworthy of such a noble cause." This seems to be designed as an escape clause for the French government and is directed against Ho Chi Minh with whom the French apparently will deal only in a last extremity. At thepresent time, the French have no intention of dealing with Ho and should he accept the terms as offered, the French would unquestionably demand the immediate surrender of his arms and armies for "the weapons must grow silent."
Bollaert first defined the goal toward which "the Vietnamese people aspire freedom within the French Union and unity of the three Kys". He said this freedom is in no way restricted other than "by the limits forced on it by the fact that these territories belong to the French Union". But France, he maintained "does not take any position with regard to the problem" of unity of the Kys save that "she requires that the Union should not be made under pressure and according to totalitarian formulas universally condemned". Then should the Union be derived from the popular wish duly expressed, local particularisms should be preserved, and the cohesion of the Anne ' countries should "be founded not on the interest of only one but on the confidence and friendship of all", he stated.
As for the states, separated or unified as they wish, M. Bollaert said "we are ready to hand over to the fully qualified governments the managements of public affairs" which means the organization without French interference of "its representative institutions, judicial proceedings, its own finance, education, social legislation, and hospitals".
The states of the peninsula, M. Bollaert then foresaw by the facts of geography have certain common ;■ i Sts which will require common policies. Hc pointed out that "all right minded people" will concede that among o'
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

things, a "common customs system, common currency, and common policy of irnmigratlon" is necessary. (This latter was added because of thc prob-.1 ems posed by the proximity of China.) These states, M. Bollaert continued, will also plan together the reconstruction of Indo China in which "of course, we (the French) have our own point of view".
"This collaboration is, after all, unavoidable and all those concerned (the French Republic being one of them) will have to decide together how, under the supervision of the High Commissioner,........
..........also be "commissioners of the republic" to defend "French economic and cultured interests".
"The High Commissioner, or bis delegate (whose functions or position is not specified), will take good care that our countrymen are enabled to enjoy all the democratic freedom enjoyed by the citizens of the states belonging to the Union and will see to it that our concerns do not fare worse than local ones; the citizens and concerns of Indochina being, in return, certain of finding the same advantages in France. The High Commissioner or his delegate will therefore, insist on ascertaining that the personal and material status of French subjects is never one-sidedly changed."	■
And finally, M. Bollaert said, the High Commissioner will have a special status drawn up for the "southern and northern minorities of Indo China whose rights are considered by the French as having a sacred character."
Al 1 the Indochinese states will be, M. Bollaert said, in the French Union which "must frame in the autonomy of the Indo Chinese people...it does not restrain private immunities...the French Union is resilient and dynamic enough to allow a nation to develop freely in framework...it is an aggregate of forces, ever on the move, each through a never ceasing interplay of exchange, giving and taking at one and the same time...it is in the French Union that men will find their raison d’etre".
But, he added, the French Union can have only one army and one diplomacy. "The police forces of the associated states of Indo China will assure in time of peace internal order on their own territory; in case of foreign aggression, they will be integrated in the armed forces of the French Union for the defense of their countries and of the Union."
M. Bollaert also promised that the French "would not take reprisals and that al 1 political and military prisoners would be liberated reciprocally. He made a thrust at the "originators of the December 19th aggression" who have lost "much of their credit with the French people". He extolled the French Union and its accomplishment and possibilities at some length and concluded:

ANALYSIS
Individual States
The speech left the way open for unification of the three Kys which the French feel as a foregone conclusion. The French cleverly do not propose any solution but leave the burden of preparing a plan acceptable to all Kys in the hands of the Vietnamese.
The status of the states, either unified or separate, is one of "liberty and freedom" within the French Union. There is no recognition of Vietnam as an "etat Libre", such as was done in the March 6 agreement. There is nowhere any mention of "independence" save in the statement by M. Bollaert in Vietnamese: "BOC LAP TRONG KHOI LAEN HIEP THAI'" (independence within the framework of the French Union.) Nor will France hand over anything to the States which resembles "sovereignty". Rather she will give only "public administration".
This omission is commented upon by the AFP in a September 12 despatch from Hanoi as follows:
"On the other hand, French circles expressed appreciation for the liberalism of the French government, a liberalism which may reduce the tension. It is only regretted that the word 'independence', as being capable of producing a (favorable) psyschological shock, was not pronoun ced."
Each state or states will organize its representative institutions, its justice, its finances, its education, its social legislation and its hospitals.
The exact judicial formula has not yet been settled, however. Didier MACHEL, Political Counsellor to the High Commissioner, whom I saw after the speech was delivered, pointed out it was uncertain whether the courts of the states would have jurisdiction over French and foreigners within its territory. He did not specify whether Laotians and Cambodians would be considered foreigners with a special status. He suggcsted, as his personal opinion, that perhaps there might be a solution in the establishment of "mixed tribunals" or possibly mixed or wholly French appelate courts over Vietnamese courts of first instance.
The state governments will have the help, if they so desire of "our functionnaires and our technicians", another retreat from the previous position as only French "counsellors, technicians, and experts" were mentioned in Article 4 of the Modus Vivendi of September 14. Finally, France .solemnly renounced all administration direct and indirect. France solemnly renounced "direct" administration in the June 6, 1884 Treaty which states in Article 7: The (French) residents (in Tonkin) will avoid, treating details of interior administration in the provinces.

Grouping of States
Bollaert did not abolish the "Federation". He diluted and watered it down and his staff maintain that it is dead. However, at least three "common services" (a euphonistic name for federal services)wi!1 exist: finance, immigration, and customs.. It is probably an economic fact that if there were no federation in Indo China it would probably be necessary to invent one. Bollaert indicated in his speech that there might be more "common services" than those he specifically mentioned. Didier MICHEL maintained vehemently there would not be; that the concept of the Federation, as proposed by D’Argenlieu, had been completely abandoned. However, the history of'French administration in Indo China is not one to inspire confidence in such limitations as the French voluntarily place on the activity of their services.
No where is there any mention of the "Surete", that ubiquitous French combination of an FBI (for Europeans) and a Gestapo (for Vietnamese). MICHEL maintained the Surete of the state or states which emerge would be in the hands of the local government. He said that in Laos and Cambodia there was not a single French member of the Surete which was entirely in the hands of the indigenous peoples. He considered that during the early stages of development in Vietnam, there would be two Suretes which would then be merged as gradually French personnel would be eliminated. "You will understand, I believe, that the situation in Tonkin is not such that we can eliminate, at the present time, the French Surete completely without danger to French lives", he said.
There is no good explanation of why Bollaert did not mention the eventual disappearance of the Surete in his speech. Nor is there any good reason why it was left to Premier RAI-IADIER rather than Bollaert to state in a Paris Press Conference that the government "undertook to eliminate the network of the administrative corps which control or direct the administrative service".
Special Status
Special status will be prepared by the High Commissioner for the minorities of the North and South whose rights have, since the war, assured an overwhelming "sacredness" to the French. It might be mentioned that the Dutch in Indonesia and, for a time, the British in Burma developed similar sentiments at about the same time.
The Mois of the south - the Rung, Tho, Meo, Nan, Lolo, Muong, Black and White Thai, among others in the north - will become more or l.ess special wards of the French. Didier MICHEL did not care to elaborate what kind of a status the French proposed for these people. This is the logical development of French policy vis-a-vis minorities set as early as April 9, 1946, as revealed by documents which the Vietnam government

obtained from the French Headquarters by ways more or less devious. It is also interesting to note that throughout last year', French officials stridently denied that they intended to enclose Vietnam in a framework of directly administered French territories.
External Relations
Vietnam or the individual three Kys are flatly denied any foreign representation as such. It or they will have the right to participate in the representation of the French Union particularly in the surrounding countries where it or they have economic and cultural interests to defend. But Vietnamese diplomats will represent regardless of their grade, only the interests of the French Union.
Anny
The States will have only armed forces which will be integrated into the single army of the French Union. The army of the "etat libre" of March 6 has thus disappeared although in time of peace the police forces of the associated states of Indo China will assure "internal order".
Commissioners	■
The Commissioners of the Republic will be attached to the local government. According to MICHEL, he or they will have only a very small staff: a political, economic, and possibly a cultural adviser or counsellor. His or their task will be to protect French interests. His position as defined is very nebulous but it will develop great strength as the defender of French interests. It offers such possibilities that no attempt can yet be made to evaluate its workings.
CONCLUSION	.
The position taken in the speech is the logical development of French policy in Indo China. As France's military strength improved with willingness to make concessions diminished. Before French troops were in place in Tonkin, France was willing to concede recognition of Vietnam as an "etat libre", having its own government, parliament, army and finances. By the Modus Vivendi of September 14 France was demanding much strengthened Federation with control of customs of primary importance. It was on the willingness of the French to enforce this customs control that the Haiphong incident of November 21 developed. It was from the desire of the French to reduce the Vietname Government to impotence that the French counterposition of November 23 with its famous ultimatum was taken.
At the present time, there are only two reasons for France to make any concessions whatsoever; world opinion (to which the Indochinese French have always been more or less immune - note the pre-war opium monopoly) and the fact that they are faced with armed resistance. ■

But should this resistance be broken in Tonkin during the coming fall campaign, there is no doubt whatsoever that the final settlement will in practice be even less liberal than its present form.
As it now stands, the French position as expressed by M. Bollaert is an elastic instrument which will become a vise if the Vietnam Govern-ment is crushed but which, if this task proves beyond French military strength, can be stretched even to cover negotiations with Ho.

In conversation vzith Embassy officer on subject of Indochina, Vice FONMIN George Yeh and Director of European Dept FONOFF expressed following views:
It is difficult to foresee a settlement of Indochina question under current French policy, which is maing position of other powers, particularly China and US, extremely difficult. It is unlikely that a govt can successfully be formed without participation of Ho Chi Minh, as Ho and his group are the only ones having a genuinely popular following.
Attempts to alienate Ho’s adherents under present circumstances unlikely of success. Persistence of French in present miIitary course carries danger of forcing entire freedom movement into hands of Extreme, Communist elements.
Ho is regarded as Communist but many Vietminh leaders are not. Vice Minister is impressed with Ho's personality and commented that Ho was an abler individual for example than Sjahrir of Indonesian Govt., both men being personally known to him. The question of possible danger to China from a Communist-influenced regime adjacent to her southern border did not appear to be of critical importance.
The National Union Front does not have a solid popular base. It consists in the main of a group of prominent figures and if these leaders were removed from the picture (the recent assassinations in Saigon and Hanoi were recalled) the movement would probably have little force left. As regards Bao-

Dai "the Chinese people would not regard favorably the reestablishment of a monarchy in Indochina. Bao-Dai has not recently been in Nanking (REDEPTEL 1205, September 29) and FONOFF officials made oblique reference to a "French story" to that effect.
Embassy comment: while no direct statement was vouchsafed by FONOFF officials as to Chinese attitude toward National Union or Nguyen Hai Than, foregoing would appear to indicate FONOFF does not conteriplate support of Bao-Dai who would seem to be an indispensable element in present French plans and that a dubious view, at best, is taken of National Union movement. As Dept is aware there are diverse Chinese elements interested in the Indochina situation and views given above do not purport to represent crystallized Chinese attitude. No allusion was made during interview to possible mediation by third power or powers.

Re APF story February 1? Cannes that Bao Dai had postponed departure Hong Kong for indefinite period, usually reliable Vietnamese source gives following summary recent events.
At Bai dalong conference December with Bollaert, Bao Dai signed accord of two articles: (1) France recognizes independence and unity Vietnam; (2)once independent, Vietnam will freely adhere to French union. When General Xuan, Tran Van Ly, and Diem (who according this source continues as "eminence grise" Nationalist) met Bao Dai Hong Kong after Bai dalong conference, Diem persuaded Bao Dai signature of above accord was tactical error, that Vietnam should only bind itself to France by alliance, not French union. (To what extent this position taken for bargaining purposes not clear). Finally decided best method of allowing Bao Dai withdraw gracefully from commitment was to take position he signed only as individual, not for his people, then have "assembly of notables" call for his return Indochina as emperor of state freely allied with France.
This strategy now being applied. Bao Dai, who anticipated failure Geneva conversations, intends for present to remain France where he can deal directly with Bidault, Schuman in preference Bollaert. Meanwhile opening gun in preparation public opinion for calling "assembly

of notables" by General Xuan was article by Nzuyen Phan Long in Saigon journal ECHO DU VIETNAM of February 17, demanding representation all groups including 'resistants." Hanoi's THODISU, which in November sabotaged Xuan's proposals for assembly of "homraes distingues," will beat drums here and Tran Van Ly's paper in Hue.
Appears Bao Dai aware of fact recent French promises local population re his early return, combined with lack of French success in military operations, have strengthened his bargaining position.

Baeyens has informed me that French Government has authorized Bollaert to approve formation provisional Vietnam government headed by Xuan but to insist that seat of government be located at either Hanoi or Hue and not at Saigon. Bollaert-Xuan negotiations will be conducted on basis Bay of Along protocol which Xuan will countersign. Bao Dai will countersign agreement reached with Xuan.
Baeyens stated Foreign Office was not optimistic as to extent popular support provisional government could achieve and expressed hope that representatives from Annam and Tonkin would be of sufficient stature to offset at least in part government's being characterized as French puppet.
He had no information other than press report of early Bao Dai-Boll a.ert meeting and Bao Dai's visit to Europe Foreign Office endeavoring to block latter which they consider could only lend support to charges of puppet government.

Responsible Foreign Office officials states that according to Chinese information very little enthusiasm had been aroused among Indochina natives by news of formation of government by General Nguyen Van Xuan. He expressed doubt that much more result would be obtained by new group than was attained by local administrative committees, unless Bao Dai came back. He believed Bao Dai was adopting wait-and-see attitude and that his decision whether to return would wait upon signs of favorable reaction to government by native elements. Upon being qucstioned, officials said latter point would in his view be more important with Bao Dai than question of independence; that Bao Dai would himself in the end accept about what Bollaert has already offered (given appearance of popular support) despite counsel of most his advisers to hold firm for independence, and this even though he incurred risk of playing role of Henry Pu Yi for French. He said Bao Dai's supporters are insisting more strongly on foreign policy independence, being less intractable on question of military control, probably in realization that native levies would be incapable for some time of putting down any continuing internal revolt.
While all Chinese elements are not one on line of action to be followed in Indochina, Foreign Office itself seems to distrust Bao Dai, viewing him as possible vehicle for restoration French prewar status. At same time many officials plainly give evidence Chinese wish to keep on freiendly terms with Ho Chi Minh.

elements in Indochina. Thus nationalism suits them, as does Ho Chi Minh with his galvanizing political force. Their expectation is that Indochinese political groups, tri th their rivalries and easy realignments, will provide their own equipoise, if the French do not have the final word. Chinese have no illusions as to Communist bent of many of Ho’s followers and possibly Ho himself. They would expect to be in a position to intervene, with the Communist menace as a pretext, if a decisive Red coup took place; moreover, they would probably attempt to take some steps toward intervention immediately (especially in Tonkin) if a Communist coup took place in France (this threat has, of course, diminished recently). Finally, if the Chinese Government itself is further weakened or possibly driven southward, the Chinese may not impossibly feel that the US will not in its own interests allow such a strategic area to fall to Communism and will necessarily come to the rescue.

Baeyens has informed Embassy that prevailing opinion in French Government circles is that Xuan Government has only dubious chance of success and that best indication its viability will, be extent decrease in guerrilla, activities during next month. States both Foreign Office and Overseas France would welcome changes in Provisional Government giving it a more representative character, as for example, replacement of Xuan by Diem. He added that Bao Dai who dislikes Xuan has repeatedly stated Provisional Government would remain in power only long enough to "secher les murs."
Commenting on Bay of Along agreement, which had previous approval of French Government (Saigon's 130, June 7, to Department, 34 to Paris), Baeyens stated referendum in Cochin China was prerequisite to Assembly approval of change in status which would undoubtcdly be vigorously opposed by Gaullists (my 3006, June 7). (Baeyens spent three hours with D'Argenlieu yesterday in discussion devoted primarily to means of protecting French interests in Cochin China.) In addition to published text there is secret annex which Baeyens describes as "neither more nor less" than Bay of Along protocol of last December. Implementing arrangements called for in paragraph 3 of agreement (text in immediately following cable) must be "negotiated from scratch," according to Baeyens who envisages conference similar Dalat or Fontainebleau.
Bollaert returns to Paris about June 20 in order confer with Coste-Floret before latter’s departure for Madagascar June 23. Baeyens does not believe

Bollaert is of opinion (DEPTEL 2891, July 29) that President French Union may legally ratify Bale d’Along agreements but that change in status Cochinchina requires Assembly action. He maintains that he will not return to Saigon unless there is an Assembly debate on government’s policy in Indochina and approval of Bale d'Along agreements and change in status Cochinchina.
Baeyens, DeLavignette and Moutet share Bollaert's views. All consider that regardless of legal considerations, failure by Assembly to meet issue squarely will have practical effect of arousing such mistrust in Indochina as to nullify completely such progress as has been made.
In last night's session of Assembly, Frederic DuPong (PRL) introduced motion calling for discussion Indochina prior to adjournment for summer. Despite request by Ramadier that motion be withdrawn "as it deals with subject too delicate for government to undertake without prudence and without a full review of all aspects of the situation." Motion was carried by narrow vote 288 to 286. Date of debate trill be set by conference of presidents.

Department of State Policy Statement on Indochina, September 27, 1948
SECRET
A. OBJECTIVES
The immediate objective of US policy in Indochina is to assist in a solution of the present impasse which will be mutually satisfactory to the French and the Vietnamese peoples, which will result in the termination of the present hostilities, and which will be within the framework of US security.
Our long-term objectives are: (1) to eliminate so far as possible Communist influence in Indochina and to see installed a self-governing nationalist state which will be friendly to the US and which, commensurate with the capacity of the peoplcs invoked, will be patterned upon our conception of a democratic state as opposed to the totalitarian state which would evolve inevitably from Communist domination; (2) to foster the association of the peoples of lndo-china with the western powers, particularly with France with whose customs, language and laws they are familiar, to the end that those peoples will prefer freely to cooperate with the western powers culturally, economically and politically; (3) to raise the standard of living so that the peoples of Indochina will be less receptive to totalitarian influences and will have an incentive to work productively and thus contribute to a better balanced world economy; and (4) to prevent undue Chinese penetration and subsequent influence in Indochina so that the peoples of Indochina will not be hampered in thcir natural developments by the pressure of an alien people and alien interests.
B. POLICY ISSUES
To attain our immediate objective, we should continue to press the French
to accommodate the. basic aspirations of the Vietnamese: (1) unity of Cochin-
china, Annam, and Tonkin, (2) complete internal autonomy, and (3) the right to choose freely regarding participation in the French Union. We have recog-nizcd French sovereignty over Indochina but have maintained that such recognition does not imply any commitment on our part to assist France to exert its authority over the Indochinesc pcoples. Since V-J day, the majority people of the area, the Vietnamese, have stubbornly resisted the reestablishment of French authority, a struggle, in which we have tried to maintain insofar as possible a position of non-support of either party.
While the nationalist movement in Vietnam (Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin) is strong, and though the grcat majority of the Vietnamese arc not funda-mentalIy Communist, the .most active element in the resistance of the local pcoples to the French has been a Communist group headed by Ho Chi Minh.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

This group has successfully extended its influence to'include pract ically all armed forces now fighting the French, thus in effect capturing control of the nationalist movement.	.
The French on two occasions during 1946 attempted to resolve the problem by negotiation with the government established and dominated by Ho Chi Minh. The general agreemcnts reached were not, however, successfully implemented and widescalc fighting subsequently broke out. Since early in 1947, the French have employed about 115,000 troops in Indochina, with little result, since the countrysidc except in Laos and Cambodia remains under the firm control of the Ho Chi Minh government. A series of French-established puppet governments have tended to enhance the prestige of Iio’s government and to call into question, on the part of the Vietnamesc, the sincerity of French intentions to accord an independent status to Vietnam. .
1. PolItical	•
We have regarded these hostilities in a colonial area as detrimental not only to our own long-tcrm interests which require as a minimum a stable Southeast Asia but also detrimental to the interests of France, since the hatred engendered by continuing hostilities may render impossible peaceful collaboration and cooperation of the French and the Vietnamese peoples. This hatred of the Victnamcse people toward the French is keeping alive anti-western feeling among oriental peoples, to the advantage of the USSR and the detriment of the US.
VZe have not urged the French to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh, even though hc probably is now supported by a considerable majority of the Victnamcse people, because of his record as a Communist and the Communist background of many of the influential figures in and about his government.
Postwar French governments have never understood, or have chosen to underestimate, the strength of the nationalist movement with which they must deal in Indochina. It remains possible that the nationalist movement can be subverted, from Communist control but this will require granting to a nonCommunist group of nationalists at Ieast the same concessions demanded by Ho Chi Minh. The failure of French governments to deal successfully with the Indochinese question has been due, in large measure, to the overwhelming internal issues facing France and the French Union, and to foreign policy considerations in Europe. These factors havc combined with the slim parliamentary majorities of postwar governments in France to militate against the bold moves necessary to divert allegiance of the Vietnamesc nationalists to non-_ Communist leadership.	.
In accord with our policy of regarding with favor the efforts of dependent peoples to attain their legitimate political aspirations, we have been anxious to see the French accord to the Vietnamese thc largest possible degree of political and economic indcpendencc consistent with legitimate French interests. We havc therefore dcclincd to permit thc export to the French in Indochina of arms and munitions for the prosecution of the war against the Vietnamese. This

Indochina’s trade with the United States before the war was relatively small as the greater part of its commerce was carried on with France and the French ' Empire duty free. Indochina now enjoys a limited customs autonomy, and the US should be able to compete more successfully with France.
American investment in Indochina has also bcen of minor importance in part at least because there has been no treaty basis for the protection of American interests there as activities in certain business lines are prohibited or can be conducted only with the consent of the French authorities.
Should a political solution satisfactory to the French and the Vietnamese be reached leading to the establishment of peaceful conditions within the area, the US should endeavor to have thc General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade made effective in Indochina and to make an arrangement which would afford protection for American enterprise there. The increased trade and investment in Indochina which might result from these measures would tend to raise thc level of economic activity and standard of living.
We do not wish to press for these matters, nor to develop a long-term financial or economic policy in the area, until such time as a political solution, such as may terminate in large measure the present hostilities, has been achieved.
With respect to the important question of whether EC A assistance should be extended to the area, we have informed thc French that because reconstruction and development of Indochina is impossible under thc present conditions of warfare which pertain there,, no direct ECA financing for Indochina will be forthcomingsat present although French requirements will be readjusted accordingly. We have indicated informally our willingness to reconsider the question should conditions change.
As regards French claims for Japanese reparations on behalf of Indochina, we have taken the position in the Far Eastern Commission (FEC) that France should receive two percent of the total amount of rcparations which may be determined to be available. While most FEC countries feel that the proposed share is too large, in view of the French wartime performance in Indochina, v/e have indicated a willingness to allow the French an additional one half of one percent. France presumably would also be eligible for a prorata share (or a portion to be determined by negotiation) of the 18 of our 28 percent of total reparations which we havc proposed to make available to such FEC countries as accept our schedule for reparations distribution. This question remains unsettled. We have not allowed the French a' portion of the advance transfers within the interim reparations program.
We havc under consideration a French claim to gold valued at 37.5 million dolIars earmarked for Japan in Indochina. Thc gold represents the settlement of certain trade balances between Indochina and Japan and of Japanese local

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
currency requirements during the period August-1940 to March 9, 1945. Since the earmarking of the gold transferred title to In'dochina and since there are no general considerations of equity or public policy of a sufficiently compelling nature to justify withholding recognition of title thus transferred, the tentative position of the Dcpratmcnt is that SCAP deliver the gold to Indochina unless an early FEC policy decision precludes such action.
C.	RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES	.
•
Thc French, whose policy since the Japanese surrender has been a failure with regard to thc Vietnamese, have made some progress in normalizing .their relations with Cambodia and Laos. Both these Indochinese protectorates have now been formally admitted as "associated” states to the French Union. Thc peoples of both these protectorates have been allowed some degree of autonomy, which apparently satisfies them for thc present. Unquestionably, however, thc current modi vivendi will be altered by any French settlemcnt with the Vietna-mesc which gives thc latter more autonomy than now possessed by the Laotians and Cambodians.	_
The most recent French attempt to resolve the question resulted in the June 5 Baic d’Along Agreement between the French High Commissioner of Indochina and General Nguyen Van Xuan, head of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, and countersigned by the former Emperor of Annam, Bao Dai. In this agreement, France recognizes the independence of Vietnam, whose responsibility it will be to unite the three Vietnamese provinces of Indochina with only such limits as are imposed by its membership in the French Union to which it frccly declares its adherence. Further negotiations to fix relationships of France and Vietnam are provided by the agreement which must now bc ratified by the French Assembly, particularly as it relates “to a change in the status of Cochinchina, now a French colony, to permit its union with Annam and Tonkin.
As regards international conferences, thc US, as it recognizes French sover-eivnty over Indochina, has uphold thc right of France as a metropolitan power to°submit the applications for associate membership in ECAFE of its dependent areas in Indochina.	•
French relations with the Siamese Government have improved since the November coup d’etat of Field Marshal Phibun. Phibun apparently has given assurances to the French, that he has accepted the solution of the recent Siamese-
Indochinese border dispute. He has furthermore taken limited measures designed to reduce the activity of Indochinese elements in Siam hostile to the' French.
Chinese relations with Indochina, based upon a 1946 treaty which confers substantial benefits upon thc Chinese in thc peninsula, are largely determined by the needs and interests of the commercially and economically powerful Chinese overseas community in Indochina, numbering almost one million. On thc surface, Chinese official relations v/ith the French officials havc been



Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
correct although signs of tension develop from time to time. Thc Chinese have pressed the French to indemnify Chinese who have suffered property loss in Indochina’s fighting. The Kuomintang has striven to maintain a tight control over thc Chinese community through consular representation, while the French have endeavored to reestablish the situation of pre-war years wherein the French authorities successfully maintained a degree of control over Chinese within Indochina.
' The Chinese, however, have also tried to protect the several hundred thous-ands of their fellowmen who live in territory not under French control. There have been contacts between Ho’s agents and Chinese government officials which apparently resulted in Chinese tolerance of a munitions traffic from China to the benefit of the Ho government. French efforts to enlist Chinese support in Kwangsi and Kwangtung to suppress Chinese bandit and Communist bands which cross the Indochinese border have not becn successful despite an agree-ment in principle.
An increasing Soviet interest in Indochina, as demonstrated by a step-up in radio broadcasts, was evidenced in the first half of 1948. The line taken by these broadcasts has been constantly to discredit the United States by attempt-ing to identify it with “imperialistic France.” There continues to be no known communication between the USSR and Vietnam, although evidence is accumulating that a radio liaison may have been established through the Tass agency in Shanghai.
D.	POLICY EVALUATION
The objectives of US policy towards Indochina have not been realized. Three years after the termination of war a friendly ally, France, is fighting a desperate and apparently losing struggle in Indochina. The economic drain of this warfare on French recovery, while difficult to estimate, is unquestionably large. The Communist control in the nationalist movement has been increased during this period. US influence in Indochina and Southeast'Asia has suffered as a result.
The objectives of US policy can only be attained by such French action as will satisfy the nationalist aspirations of the peoples of Indochina. We have repeatedly pointed out to the French the desirability of their giving such satisfaction and thus terminating the present open conflict. Our greatest difficulty in talking with the French and in stressing what should and what should not be done has becn our inability to suggest any practicable solution of the Indo-china problem, as we arc all too well aware of the unpleasant fact that Com-munist Ho Chi Minh is the strongest and perhaps the ablest figure in Indochina and that any suggested solution which excludes him is an expedient of un-certain outcome. We are naturally hesitant to press the French too strongly or to become deeply involved so long as we are not in a position to suggest a solution or until lye are prepared to accept the onus of intervention. The above considerations are further complicatcd by the fact that we have an im-
’Z

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
--------------------------------—_—-------------------------
mediate interest in maintaining in power a friendly French government, to assist in the furtherance of our aims in Europe/"This immediate and vital interest has in consequence taken precedence over active steps looking toward thc realization of our objectives in Indochina.
We are prepared, however, to support thc French in every way possible, in thc establishment of a truly nationalist government in Indochina which, by giving satisfaction to thc aspirations of thc peoplcs of Indochina, will serve as a rallying point for the nationalists and will weaken the Communist elements. By such support and by active participation in a peaceful and constructive solution in Indochina we stand to regain influence and prestige.
Some solution must bc found which will strike a balance between the aspirations of the peoples of Indochina and the interests of the French. Solution by French military reconquest of Indochina is not desirable. Neither would the complete withdrawal of thc French from Indochina eITect a solution. Thc fust alternative would delay indefinitely thc attainment of our objectives, as we would share inevitably in the hatred engendered by an attempted military reconquest and the denial of aspirations for self-government. The second solution would be equally unfortunate as in all likelihood Indochina would then bc taken over by the militant Communist group. At best, there might follow a transition period, marked by chaos and terroristic activities, creating a political vacuum into which the Chinese inevitably would be drawn or would push. The absence of stabilisation in China will continue to have an important influence upon thc objective of a permanent and peaceable solution in Indochina.
We havc not becn particularly successful in our information and education program in orienting the Vietnamese toward the western democracies and the US. The program has been hampered by thc failure of the French to understand that such informational activities as we conduct in Indochina arc not inimical to their own long-term interests and by administrative and financial considerations which havc prevented the development to thc maximum extent of contacts with the Vietnamese. An increased effort should be made to explain democratic institutions, especially American institutions and American policy, to the Indochinese by direct personal contact, by the distribution of intorma-tion about the US, and the encouraging of educational exchange.

Soviet Policy in Southeast Asia
Subject:
I have the honor to refer to tho Department’s secret circular ^instruction of October 13, 1948/entitled "Pattern of Soviet Policy in Far East and Southeast Asia" and to submit certain comments, as requested by the Department.
Soviet policy in Indochina appears to follow in general tho lines described in tho final section of the instruction under ac-
imowlodgement but with certain minor variation. In general it my bo said°tho.t Indochina presents an ideal picture from the point of view of iosco’A'. A small group of Moscow and Chinese trained Communists has firn control of the strong and deep seated native Nationalism. A native government under Communist direction controls considerable areas of the country and maintains an army sufficiently strong to pin down large French forcos. The country has been kept in turmoil since the end of the war, making it a serious drain on the military and economic resources of France instead of a source L ;
\of wealth. From the point of viaw of Moscow, prospects are excel-'-)✓ .lent that no Chi ^'lNH will eventually force the withdrawal of the French and set up the first "New Democratic Republic" in Southeast ‘ Asia. At tho same time Communist control has boon concealed and
oo/l|-548
identified with Nationalism so successfully as to confuse and
delude public opinion in France and the United States and thus gain ths support of large Socialist and liberal groups in those countries.
✓
f.f In recent months particular emphasis has bean placed‘on eco-domic sabotage. This has included burning of rice mills and rubber O warehouses in Saigon, and attacks on communications of all types, including railroads, road Convoys and barge transport. This has F ■ been so successful that the movement of paddy and rica to Saigon- f,:; Cholon has practically ceased in recent wtiaks. Curiously enouch fr / there have boon no serious attacks on the particularly vulnerable □ C petroleum depots in Saigon and Haiphong nor have the larger rubber □. — plantations boon seriously disturbed.	» — Sx
The Communist led Vict:ninh has not yet adopted the violent *	‘
anti-American lino followed by most Coruunist parties throughout’ . 1 ' ' the world, although there are many indications that this is only:

on the surface and that tho standard anti-American lino is being distributed.in directives to party leaders. No evidence has yet turned up that Ho Chi ”inh is receiving current directives either
; from Moscow, China, or thc Soviet Legation in Bangkok. It may bo I assumed that Moscow fools that Ho and his lieutenants have had I sufficient training and experience and are sufficiently loyal to ’• be trusted to determine their day-to-day policy without supervision. I	•	•
j
Another factor peculiar to Indochina is tho apparent quicscance of CommuniSt elements among the resident Chinese Colony. Not only are these believed by the Surete to be relatively few in number, but any plans they may havc had to emulate thoir comrades in Malaya have undoubtedly becn hampered by the Surete which haS been quietly rounding up and deporting their leaders for several months. It may also be that Moscow feels that anti-Chineso feeling is so strong in tho Vietnam that active cooperation of Chinese Communists with tho Vietminh would furnish too valuable a propaganda weapon to tho French.

MEMORANDUM ON INDOCHINA FOR NEW DELHI FOREIGN SERVICE CONFERENCE
SECTION I. POLITICAL SITHATION
A. Internal Political Situation in the Vietnam
1.	General Situation - Postwar developments in the Annamite provinces of Indochma, known as the Vietnam, are fundamentally similar to those in othor parts of Alia in that they stem from u powerful upsurge of National-ism. The Vietnam stands out from other regions in that Communism has gained control of the Nationalist movement and created a situation which <	is a classic example of the successful. anpl?cation of Communist strategy
in a colonial area. A small lioscow and Chineso trained group has seized leadership and control of the strong and almost universal]y supported independence movement» Tho country has bcm kept in a state of strife and -confusion for three y oa r s. On o hu nd red 11 rou sand Fran ell t ro cp s a re p i nn cd down in Indochina and rot available in Europe> Tho area is a serious drain on Prance’s resources instaad of a source of wcalth end raw mate-rials for France and tho world. Finally thcm is a fair chance that tho French my be driven out and the first Communist outpost in Southcast Asia established.
Tho Trench have belatedly coma to a partial understanding of the situation with which they arc faced and era cut?covering to crcnt a non-Communist autonomous gcvcrnmcnt under thc leadership of former Emperor Bao DAI. They hope to retain the Vietnam within the r.obulous French Union and maintain French military and cconcn'.c positions.
2.	Buck;-,round - To understand how tho prosent situation arose a brief rcvicw of tho history of the colony is necessary. Indochina camo under European domination considerably later than Indonesia, India, or the Philippines, tho French first occupying part of Cochinchina in 1864. The area cf this colony was expanded while proteotoratos wero established over tho romcinin? parts of thc peninsula during subsequent years. The administration t-ndad to become more centralizcd and eventually evolved into a tightly knit political and economic federation in which tho rights and pcvcrs of the Emperor of Annam, King of Cambodia, and Princes of Laos had pn.ctic-lly disappeared. There was little autonomy or self govorn-mont oven at the local level and little plr.ee for natives in the adminis-tration except in minor cr essentially honorary posts.
Tho French arc justly proud of the task which thoy Ibcomplished in building roads and railroads) developing ports, converting the svr.mps of the Cocrilnchincso deltas into rice lands, r.nd developing the mineral resources of Tonkin. They else made considerable progress in implanting tho French language ana culture through schools and the church. (There arc about two million native Catholics in tho Vietnam, nearly 10/ of tho nopul r.ticnj Hourly r 11 educated Armrnoc speak semo French.
Tho occupation and pacification of the country was not accom-plishnd without numerous revolts which were put down with great severity. Tho Nationalist movement, however, was never completely suppressed and ■ ■ ✓...................................................................

developed particularly rapidly in the period between the two world wars. The Communists early became influential therein although never numerous. The Trotzkyist faction was strong and at one time controlled the Indochinese Communist party.
The shattering defeat of France by Germany and the immediately following Japanese occupation of Indochina dealt a severe blow to French prestige with the natives, while the early Japanese victories in the Pacific extended this loss of face to all whites. Even though the Annamese hated the Japs, five years of anti-western propaganda left permanent effects on the minds of the people.
In the final months of the war when defeat was inevitable, Japanese leaders in Indochina deliberately created a situation which would make the return of the French difficult by setting up a native government and allowing arms to get into native hands. The allies had contributed to this situation by parachuting arms and supplies to the native underground fighting the Japanese. As in most occupied countries both in Asia and Europe, the Communists were one of the most active and best organized elements in this underground. Some months before the Japanese surrender Ho Chi MINH returned secretly to Indochina. He has had a long and prominent history as an Annamite revolutionary and a Comintern agent under a variety of aliases. For the Communists there was no question of his leadership; to others he was known as a lift long fighter for independence who had returned from exile to lead his people. He had around him a small group of able Communists trained as he was in Moscow, or veterans of the Chinese Communist movement. Following the then current popular front tactics, Ho organized a coalition of political parties known as the Viet Minh League and set up a government in which Communist control was at first concealed.
Thus when after some delay the Chinese arrived in Tonkin and the British in Saigon to disarm the Japanese troops, they found a native government established and in control.
A more detailed account of events from this point on will be found in the annex to this memorandem.
3.	French Colonial Policy, Past and Present - While not always clear or consistent, French colonial policy before the war -was generally one of assimilation. In its highest and simplest form, this was based on a complete absence of color or race prejudice and a belief that the mission of France was not to prepare her subject peoples for independence, but to convert them to French civilization, culture, and religion and prepare them to become French citizens and their homelands to become integral parts of France. (Martinique and Guadaloupe were examples of the complete application of this policy.)
This policy had been questioned even before the war and in 1943 General de Gaulle held a conference of colonial experts at Brazzaville to consider postwar colonial problems. At this conference was born the idea of the French Union which was to be a centralized colonial federation with varying degrees of local autonomy but with essential control
• remaining in Paris.

When France was liberated and the drafting of a new constitution
was taken up, colonial policy played an important but confusing part. Few of the dcputics to the two constituent assemblies knew much abcut colonial matters while the few "experts" were shmply divided. It must be remembered that the average Frcnchman believes what he was taught in school - that France is the only colonial power that really understands the natives, that the latter are universally grateful for the benefits of French civilization and that any discontent is the work of a small minority of professional agitators. '
Those who realized that the era of colonialism "was past and that
France must make fundamental changes in her policy if she were not to lost her empire could Hake little impression on the general apathy and ignorance. Even the Communists were hesitant about going too far against public opinion by advocating independence for the colonies, and were probably also doubtful about the wisdom of breaking up an empire which they expected shortly to control.
The result of all these factors was a constitution which was
extremely vague, confused, and conflicting on colonial matters. It provides for three classes of overseas territories - (a) the overseas departments which arc an integral part of France, (b) the overseas territories which have limited local autonomy, and (c) the Associated States. The latter category was created to take care of Morocco, Tunis, and the states of Indochina. No details were given as to their position in the Union except that it should be determined an "Act" or agreement with each Associated State.
The overseas territories (and, of course, the overseas depart-
ments) are represented in the Assembly and even more heavily in the Conseil de la Republique, the upper branch of the French Parliament. In addition, there is an Assembly of the French Union composed of half colonial and half metropolitan members which, however, has only consultative powers. Finally there is to be a Council of the French Union composed of a representative of each Associated State, the President of France, and certain cabinet members.
It was expected that the Vietnam would be the first Associated
State and that the agreement with it would establish precedents for the entry of Morocco and Tunis. Unfortunately by the time the constitution was adopted and in operation, the situation had already gotten out of hand in Indochina. Ho Chi Minh was not willing to accept the extremely limited authority which the French insistence on controJ of defense, foreign affairs, and economic policy would leave him, and incited by the inept policy of Admiral d’ARGENLIEU and his subordinates, he madc a surprise attack on December 19, 1946, which almost succeeded in overrunning the French forces in Tonkin and Annam and resulted in the murder of many innocent French civilians.
This attack strengthened the influence of the conservative and
reactionary circles in France and Indochina and was followed by a desperate attempt to pacify thc country by military means. While the control of most of the cities was regained, the countryside remained in the hands, of Ho’s forces and open fighting gradually shifted to

Tho realisation that pacification of the country by force, oven if possible, would be a long and costly process, and fc.tr that world public opinion might force UNO or American intervention caused tho French Government to shift policy in tho spring of 1946 r.nd replace Admiral d’Argcnlicu- by a civilian, 1.N Erile 3C11AERT, as High Com-missionor. Ho wns sent to Saigon with no precisc instructions but with tho h'pc th'.t ho could roach agrcomont with somcono and step the fighting.
In judging tho situation on April 1, 1917, vrhcn he arrived in Indochina, developments in th® Froneh- and into run ticns.1 political situ-ation since 1945 must be kept in mind. The most important was un-doubtodly tho growing split between the Western powers and Moscow. iVhon tho French first accepted to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh, his Communist background was of minor importance. France was an ally of Russia/ and the- French Communists were an important element in tho coalition government in Paris. In tho your that passed before Bollacrt arrived on the scene, the international crisis had bacome clear, the Communists were no longer in the French Government, and the fact that th.c Viet Minh was Communist controlled became an important political factor. Thus Bollacrt soon decided that the resumption of negotiations with Ho was impossibla.
His decision to croatdd new political force arcund tho ex-Erpcror Bnc Dc.i and the lengthy and c.nfusei negotiations “hioh fol-lcwed this arc described in come detail in the annex to this memo-randum. As it finally tock form, what is comnonly called the Rollaert-Buo Dai solution may be summarized as follows:
a.	It var necessary to recapture from tho Communists control cf the Victnnm Nationalist movements.
b.	To do this it was necessary to group together anti-Comraunist forces around some pelitier.l figure with national nrcstigo end influence. Bae Dai was selected - with considerable reluctance'- since it was felt that traditional monarchism was still a Corea amcnE; tho people, (and because it wc.s folt that l.is French education and the fact that his wife is a devout Catholic would mnko him a more reasonable person to derl with).
c.	Au agrocront would bo negotiated with Rao Dai granting the minimum Naticr.nl'st demands .

(probably 8O> of the total) and which were becoming increasingly fed up with the totalitarian methods and discipline of the Communist leaders of the Viet Minh and discouraged by months of hardship in the jungle.
e.	Gradually Bae Dai’s strength would increase and Ho's decline until the latter would either have to surrender, flee the country, or become a minor guerrilla leader.
It is obvious that the success of such a plan required granting sufficient authority and concessions to Bao Dai to enable him to establish a stable government in at least a restricted area and to convince native leaders that their essential demands had be.en met and that there was no longer any reason for continuing to fight. In this Bollaert failed, largely because of the political situation in France. The various "Third Force" governments were not only weak but sharply-divided on colonial policy. They were particularly anxious not to give ammunition to the grot-ring strength of de Gaulle's forces, always ready to exploit the average Frenchman’s out-of-date views on colonial matters. Thus Bollaert was not even able to persuade the Government to request Assembly ratification of the extremely vague Eaie d’Along Protocol of June 5, 1948. This fact was largely responsible for Bao Dai's decision not to return to Indochina which made further stops in the implementation of the plan impossiblc, even though a Provisional Central Government had been set up under General XUAN, former President of the Cochinchina Provisional Government.
Bollaert gave up in disgust and was replaced by M. Leon PIGNON, a young career colonial officer with much experience in Indochina.
4.	Present Situation - M. Pignon, being a civil servant rather than a politician brought a fresh viewpoint to the situation, and appears to have made considerable progress towards a solution in his short period of office.
He has adopted the policy of his predecessor but has been successful in having it accepted as that of the French Government rather than as a personal policy of the High Commissioner. In this he was aided by a number of factors, the most important, of course, being recent devclopments in China. Even the most die-hard French political leader can realize that with the arrival of Chinese Communist forces on the Tonkin frontier which would assist or perhaps even join with Ho Chi Mnh, the precarious French military position would become impossible. Moreover, a growing number of prominent Frenchmen in and out of the Government has in recent months advocated liberal concessions to Vietnam Nationalism. Even the Indochina resolution of the RTF (Gaullist) Congress last fall was surprisingly moderate, (although General de Gaulle himself has been less liberal).
Pignon reopened negotiations with Bao Dai in November and continued them in January after his return from a brief turn in Indochina. Little definite is known as to the exact status of these negotiations, but apparently concessions have been made on both sides. Bao Dai has agreed to return to Indochina if the French Assembly ratifies the Bale d’Along Agreement and changes the status of
Cochinchina
163

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

Cochinchina from a French colony to a part of the Associated State of Vietnam. A debate on these points is expected early in March. Bao Dai also wishes the prompt signing and ratification of a treaty cover-ing the subjects reserved under the Bale d'Along Protocol, but it seems doubtful if this can be accomplished in the time available before his return. Disagreement still continues on certain points, the most important apparently being over separate diplomatic representation for the new state. The French are believed to have offered consulates in neighboring countries and Vietnam officers in certain French missions.
Opinions differ considerably as to the chances of the French Government to obtain the necessary parliamentary action. Undoubtedly opposition will be violent from both the extreme right and left wings while the Socialist Party will be seriously split. However, specul-lation at this time is pointless since the matter will presumably be settled by the time the conference opens at New Delhi.
A more pertinent question is - assuming Bao Dai returns - what chances has he to establish a stable government, split away the non-Communist followers of Ho Chi Minh, and eventually pacify the country? It is believed that the most important factor will be the nature of the French agreement with Bao Dai and the meaning which it gives to "independence within the French Union." If this independence is a sham with most real authority remaining in French hands, then Communist propaganda proclaiming him a puppet and a traitor will be vindicated.
A second factor is the manner in which the return is staged and the agreement is implemented. Because of the delay, inaction, and disunity on the part of the French in recent months, the Vietnam leaders and people have become cynical and distrustful. The popular enthusi-asm which might have been aroused by the return of Bao Dai last June can no longer be expected. Furthermore, the French civilian population, in Indochina will be sullenly hostile to any new regime while few of-ficials can bo counted on to offer real cooperation in the difficult transition perido. The result of the French local elections in March will also be a factor since if they forecast a return of de Gaulle, doubt will be cast on the permanence of the agreement with Bao Dai.
Finally much will depend on Bao Dai’s ability to resolve the rivalry and intrigue between Vietnam leaders and the regional jealousy and suspicion between the three provinces which are to form the Vietnam state. The Tonkinese are poor but energetic, intelligent and aggressive, the Annamese poor but cultured and proud, while the Cochinchinese feel that the other provinces are interested mainly in sharing the wealth of their region. Opposition to the French and Chinese is about the only thing that the leaders of the three provinccs see eye to eye on. Cochin-chinese separatism has been oncouraged and supported by French business interests and less openly by many French officials.
B.	Internal Situation in Cambodia and Laos .
The people of Cambodia and Laos differ in race, religion, and temperament from the Vietnamese, and the problem of their relation with France is less difficult and acute. Cambodia has good reason to fear
the aggression

Lust year Cambodia and Laos betam tho first tssoci.tod States in tho French Union, and recently tho •'indcpcndcnoa" of Cambodia in the French Union was proclaimed. The negotiations for an agreomont or treaty to doteminc tho meaning of those tormc has boon delayed until the Vietnam problem is scttlod, with the French promising that Cambodia would ro-ccivo at least the sumo concessions.
Cambodia has a new liberal constitution and has made soma pro- ■ gross in adopting thc ferns of democracy. French officials are now called advisors tc their Cambodian counterparts and exert their authority largely behind tho scones.
There has been increasing evidence of Cambodian impatibncs over thc delay in fixing thcir final status, and a determination to win widcr autonomy and sovereignty. M. Pignon as former Governor of Cambodia can bo expected to be sympathetic to these demands.
Laos with a population of only cne million, thinly scattered along tho upper Mekong, is oven less a political problem. After thc war tho French set up tho Princo of Luong Fmbnng as King of Laos undor a temporary agreement similar to that with Cambodia. Tho French administration in Laos is, however, mch more direct and open. Thc region has boon generally peaceful, but there havo recently boon rumors of concentration of "Free Laotians" in the Siamese provinces along tho Mekong which may forecast raids into Indochinoso territory. ' The objective of thc Free Laotians is apparently -an independent greater Laos including both thc French province c.nd territories inhabited by Laotians in Siam.
C.	Intcrnational Relations.
1.	United States - Post war relations between tho United States and Indochina got off to a bad start-with President Roosevelt1s views on international trusteeship for strategic areas in the hands of powers unable to defend them, followed by thc overenthusiastic activities cf certain 033 agents in the period just before and after tho Japanese surrender. Tho belief that thc policy of tho United States is to throw tho French out of Indochina still persists in many circles both in Indochina and in Franco, We are also blamed for permitting the Cliinoso and English to occupy the northern and southern halves of the country to disarm Japanese troops. Our pursistent refusal to supply equipment and arms for Fronch military operations in Indochina. is a sore subject with most French army officers. Another source of irri-tation has been tho almost universnl tendency of Amrican correspondents visiting Indochina to write articles cxtrcmdy critical of thc French.
As conditions haw; detoriorntcd in Indochina (and in Europe) thcr? has beer, n^ro underr.tan'iug cf our policy and mono dosire to ob tn in cur appr o vu 1 and as s i sbanco in i r n 1 e:-nn t ing French plans, and at higher levels relations arc relatively cordial.

In recent wacks the Freicti hkvo activity suppoIted proposals for four power cooperation in Southeast Asia tc prevent tho spread of Communism, and there har boon much talk about the strategic importance of Indochina as a bastion against the southward spread of Chi noao Communists.
As far as thc Ar.namitcs are concerned, they wore encouraged to believe that after tho defcat of Japan wo would assist them in ob-t^Lning indcpcndencoi As it hceamo opparont that our sympathies were tempered by strategic considoraticns in Eurcpc, thc popularity of tho United States has diminished. Hovorthcless, tho prestige of the United States is still high, and even Ho Chi Minh has boon careful to prevent any public anti-American propaganda.
2.	Chinn - Tho civilization of thc Vietnam is essentially Chinoso, and political and cultural ties have been close throughout the con-tunics. Ncvartheloss, there is little sympathy or natural liking between thc two luces largely because of thc fenr of future Chinese expansion and jealousy of the large Chincso minority which controls most of the business and trade of the country. Tho Chinese occupying forces in Tonkin and northern Annam left behind a bitter memcry.
In thc French-Chinese Treaty of 194C, Franco granted important concessions in China. These indudod thc return of thc French concession in Shanghai and thc lensed territory of Kwangchow. tho sale of thc Chinese portions of tho Yunnan Railroad, a free port in Haiphong, and tho continuation of free Chinese immigration into southern Indo-china. The latter two provisions angered Vietnam leaders, and there have been repeated warnings that sinco they wore not consulted in drafting the treaty, they did not consider themselves bound to honor it when they regained their independence. Attacks on Chinese immigration arc frequent in tho native press. The French authorities have boon far from reluctant to heed the voice of public opinion, and arc endcavoring to chock immigration by strict cnforccrbnt of quarantine and other regulations.
Tho problem cf Chinasc Communists will bo treated in a subsequent section.
3.	Philippines - Political and economic relations between Indo-chinn and the Philippine Republic are of surprisingly minor irportanco. Thore is not even a Philippine Consulate in Saigon.

Disappointment c or thc fact that Vietnam rcpro^oat-dtivcs were not invitee and. th at Indochina was not discussed was undoubtedly a factor
in the poor press rec&lvod by thc conference.
7.	India - Tho considcrdblo Indian minority, most of whom are shop kocpcrs“and money lenders, is tho most important factor in relations between Indochina and India. Tho presence of a number of minor officials, chiefly police, from Pondichcry, also tends to harm rotations between
■ tho Viotnamosc o.n.i Indians. Difficulties over tho future of thc French territories' in India naturally gets much attention in tho French press.
It is not believed that an independent Vietnam will be enthusi-

No ono knats how many Communists t.hcro arc in Indochina, but thc number of real party rnmbors is certainly, small. Thc highest estimate is 20% of tho troops fighting with Ho Chi Minh and this includes sympathizers. Howcvor, tho number is undoubtedly growing, and at tho same time non-Communist military units arc being steadily infiltrated with secret agents. Units under Communist command are generally better armed. Thus thc problem for tho lcrdcr contemplating changing sides is not an easy one.	•
Another point on which definite information is lacking is the channel of co.Tmunications with l'oscy- and the center of regional control. [lt is probable that all of thc available channels are used -overland fro:?. China, Burra, and Siam, and by soa from China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It is also very possible that Moscow directives arrive via Franco^) Certainly satisfactory cormunications exist since Moscow publications of fairly recent date arc frequently seized by thc French »l__,Cormuni st headquarters in South Asia arc variously reported to be in Hong nong, Bangkok, Singapore, Rangoon, and Calcutta. Hong Kong somas to bo the most likely!
One- peculiar thing about Vietnam Communism it: that there has boon vary littlc anti-American propaganda. It is obvious that this is not duo to irncranco of the current party lino. It apparently roprosonts a hope on tho part of Ho Chi Minh that ho nay still obtain American support for or at least acceptance of a Viet Minh government under his leadership. Evidence that this hope is diminishing is furnished in a . regional party directive dated in November 1948 which stated that active anti-American propaganda should bo conducted in party circles and by word of mouth among tho people but should not yet appear on thc radio, in tho press, or in public spccchcs). Thc main thor.o cf this proyc.^mdr, was to bo that the United States is an imperialist power which aims to extend its domination over Indochina "in a manner even noro cruel and ruthloss than tho French". An interesting item was that pro-Anorican Amianites wore to bo denounced in anonymous
letters to Frcnch officials which indicates that thc Communists are
awuro of thc similarity between thoir propaganda and thc bclicf cf certain French circlcs.
Tho problem of Communism among tho Chinese minority is onc which has boon given much attention by the Frcnch nuthoritios, especially since tho situation bccn.no critical in China. Up until now there has been surprising little direct cooperation bctwcon local Chinese Communists and the- Viet Minh.

Background Irfor-ation
It is believed th it a brief discussion of the background . ? essential to the tint ter stand inn of tho present situation in Indo-china. The follo’ving paragraphs accordingly present a somewhat over-simplified version of events since 1145.
On March 9, 1945, thc Japanese took over direct control of the administration of Indochina, disarmed French troops and interned most Frcnch officials and civilians. Emperor Bao DAI was retained in power and promised independence. When Japan surrendered, Japanese officials in Indochina permitted control to be seized ly Annamese nationalists. Emperor Bao Dai abdicated on August 25, 1945, and Ho Chi liliTH, a prominent Comintern loader, proclaimed the Vietnam Republic on September 2. Tho British, who moved into tho southern ,	region to disarm Japanusc troeps, refused to recognize thc new
republic and promptly turned over the administration to the French. There 'was some fighting in Saigon and continued guerrilla warfaro throughout Cochinchina.
In thc north the Chinese occupation forces recognized Ho’s government and supported pro-Chinesc elements in the dominant Viet Minh party coalition. After prolonged negotiations and considerable concessions on thc part of tho French (Shanghai, Yunnan Railroad, et cetera) thc Chincsc agreed to withdrm". On March 6, 1946, just beforo thc Chinese withdrawal, a representative of the French High Commissioner signed a brief protocol with Ho Chi Minh, recognising the Vietnam as a free country within tho Frcnch Union and tho Indochincse Federation with its own army, finances, and government. Thc status of Cochin-china was to be determined by a plcbiscitc. Details'were to bo-worked out at a subsequent conference.
Aftor unsuccessful negotiations at Dnlat, Ho and a largo delegation erne to France oarly in June. Thc so-called Fonteincbloau Con-fereneo lasted from July 5 to Scptsmbdr 11. It brokc dorm ovar tho issues of tho unity of Cochinchinu with thc rest cf Annam., military relations, and Vietnam demands for a separate diplomatic service and control of customs, finance and economic natters. Just before leaving Franco, Ho signed a E^dus 1110'111 v'ith Minister of Overseas Franco KOUTET which provided for stopping guerrilla fighting in southern Indochina, rcloaso of prisoners and hostages, and for the resumption of negotiations in January 1947.
When
1. It should be recalled tint tho Foatuinoblcau Conference took place during tho period of thc s.ecnd Constituent Assembly in which colonial policy wc.s a crucial and bitter issue. Thus tho French negotiators wcrc hamstrung by luck of imcwlcdcc cf what the new constitution would do about tho French Unicn. v.-hile the Victn:m delegation was both doubt-ful of the authority cf tho French doIeguticn and encouraged to bo intranoi-.-rt L; violent spouchcs in the Assembly by colonial and Communist deputies.

When Ho roturnod to Hanoi, m October, he found extremists m his government, led by Communist Minister of Lar GIAP, had increased their influence during his nearly five months1 absence. Tho measures for stopping thc fighting in Cochinchina wore ncvcr implemented and relations vrith the French deteriorated rapidly. A dispute over customs control in Haipho: in Rovambor resulted in localized fighting, and on Deco mb ar 19, 1S1C, a carefully prepared surprise attack almost succeeded in overrunning French forces in.Tcnkin and Amtun.
Fighting has been continuous since then. Aftor a few weeks of real v.nrfurc in Hanoi and vicinity it deteriorated into bittor and costly guerrilla operations. With groat difficulty France concentrated about 100,000 troops in Indochina armed chiefly with British and '	Amorican lend lento equipment. This force, while sufficient to gar-
ri son thc chief cities .nd maintain precarious communications between them, was not large cnounh tc pacify thc country. Civil and military officials in both France and Indochina, have for some time admitted that this cannot be dono without greatly increased forces which arc not available.
When it bocar.0 apparent 'that a military solution was not practicable tho French returned to the idea of negotiations. Admiral d‘AR.GENLIEu was replaced as High Commissicnor by BOLLAERT, a rcsis-• tnnca lcr.dcr and former career prefect. Partly bccausc of the projudice of Minister Moutc-t, who considered the attack cf Dccombcr 1S ns a porsonul affront to hi-., and also bccausc *of growing anti-Communisr. in Franco, thc Frcnch were reluctant to resume nogotiaticns with Ho Chi Minh. In thc absence cf any othor lcnder with a national following, thc Frcnch turned to thc cx-Erpcror -no Dai who w?.s living in exile in Hong Kong. During thc sunr.cr of 1947 fevered and confused negotiations succeeded in collecting a motley group of parties, movements and individuals willing to support P.o Dai. Thc nucleus was traditional monarchists from. Annam and Tonkin. To this was joined certain native Catholic elements in Tonkin, the Caodaist and Hoa Ino religious sects
•	in Cochinchina,- certain anti-Communist nationalists, and various other
minor groups with nixed motives.
‘ • .
By September 1947, the French fclt prepared to open a combined diplomatic and military offensive. Bollaert was to make an important policy speech outlining the conditions for a settlement, while a limited military offensive in Fenkin world weaken Ho Chi Minh and encourage waverors tc rally to Eao Dai. Unfortunately, thc text of Bolluort’s spcoch bcccraa a political football in France and ns de-livorcd was so •.ratt-red down that it mdc a pcor impression in native circles.

SECRET and technicians, but loft to later negotiations the detailed solution of diplomatic, military, economic, financial, and technical matters. (This agreement was, except for two unimportant words, exactly tho same as tho one signed on Juno 5, 1048, by Bollaert. Xuan, and Bao Dai.) Bollaert is understood to have agreed he would not deal with Ho, It 'was arranged that the two would meet again in Fobruary to make final arrangc-monts for thc return of Bao Dai to■Indochina.
l
Bollaert returned to France to explain his plans to his government and obtain its approval. Bao Dai unexpectedly followed Bollaert, going to Sv.'itccrlm-.t whoro ho had a meeting with M. Bollaert in January. Tho High Commissi eno x- returned to Indochina on January 26 to prepare for thc mooting with Bao Dai scheduled for February. Tho latter, however, wcnt to France and was received by a number cf high government officials. This infuriated Bollaert, who threatened to resign and was only placated by an official statement that negotiations with Bao Dai would bo gx-clusively through him.
Events from this point on wore confused. Obviously Bao Dai had rcconsidcred his reluctant qgrce-tont to roturn to Annam and felt that additional concessions and guarantees wcrc essential if he were to gain the support of sufficient Nationalist elements to insure stability for his new government. In addition, his stay in Franco had opened his eyes to tho unstable position of the French government and the possibility of a return to power of de GAULLE.
Bao Dai did not return to Heng Kong until March 14, 1948. The following webks were marked by much, coming and going between Saigon and Ho: Kong of Frcnch and Vietnam roprcscntativos, and continually changing rumors of the status of thc negotiations. Apparently despairing of persuading Bao Dai. to return in thc ncar future, Bollaert agreed to set up a Provisional Central Vietnam Government which would prepare the wy for the Emperox', who agreed to give his moral backing to thc new regime.
Thc new government was headed by General Xuan, then President cf the Cochinchincso Government. Xuan, while an Annanito by birth, is a general in thc French Army, a Frcnch citizen, and married to a French womn. Eo was, of course, promptly branded as a Frcnch puppot (which is not believed to be true). Xuan had great difficulty in persuading persons of ability and influence to join his government, even with the backing of Bao Dai, and thc team ho collected was very wcak, particu-larly as rcgafds representatives frem Tonkin.
On Juno 5, 1948, Bollaert mot vrith Xuan and Bao Dai, again on a cruisor in tho Eaic d1 Along, and a new agreomont v.ns signed which was almost exactly the same as the first one. The text was promptly made public in contrast to thc first protocol. The ex-Emperor left for Switzerland the same day vdiilv M. Bollaert rnturrod to France shortly afterwards. President Xuan proclaimed his new government in Hanoi.

The High Commissioner apparently believed that ho would obtain prompt ratification of his agrehmant by tho French Cabinet and Assembly, following which, Dao Dai would return to Indochina, and the negotiations for' tho supplementary agreements could then bogin. Unfortunately, ho returned tc Paris at a particularly difficult moment. Tho Schumann Government was faced with growing internal dissension and opposition within the Assembly. Thc Socialist Party Conference had revealed a swing to tho left and voted a resolution favoring negotiations with Ho Chi Minh. Colonialist and conservative groups in Indochina and' Franco began an active campaign against the Bale d'Along agreemont as . the first step in throwing away thc empire. In the circumstances, tho government was naturally reluctant to take up a problem which might well result in its overthrow by the Assembly and which appeared less urgent than other serious internal and international problemss After thc Schumann Cabinet finally fell, the shortlived Mario Cabinet was cvon less eager to face a dcbnte on Indochina.
Whcn tho long scheduled interpolation on Indochina finally cni.c up on tho agenda, the Prine Minister asked that tho debate be postponed indefinitely, but indicated, the govorrmont'• s approval of Bollaert’s policy and the Bale d’Along protocol and announced that u vote in favor of adjournment would be. considered as approving this policy. A substantial majority was obtained, after a brief debate on tho adjournment motion which indicated general approval of the Bale d'Along protocol by all parties except tho Communists, but considerable differences of opinion as to its interpretation and methods of application. The Socialists in particular ware embarrassed by tho partv directive mentioned above.
■ 11. Bollaert returned to Indochina breathing optimism and pro-fessing to bo completely satisfied with the Assembly*s action and convinced that Bao Dai would return, and the implementation of tho Baio d'Along protocol could proccod immediately. This optimistic facado crumbled quickly. Bao Dai lost no timo in making it clear that ho was not returning until a fonnl agreement had boon signed and ratified by thc French Government, not only covering the prinoi-pies of the Bais d*Along protocol< but the reserved subjects loft for future negotiation. Private and public statements of Xuan and his ministers and articles in the native press shelved that they vtere in no way satisfied ’with tho oblique handling of thc mutter by the French Government, The local colonialist press proclaimed a defeat for Bollaort and took pains to point out that the •.'.■hole situation in Indo-china was illegal and unconstitutional and that, in particular, no change could take place in the political status of Cochinchinn. ’without formal Assembly action, since Cochinchina, in contrast to Tonkin and Annam, is a French colony and French soil.

his plans for a prompt solution of the Indochinese problem had failed and that much time and effort still remained to be expended.
Tile appointment of M. PIGNON as successor to M. Bollaert came as a great surprise since his name had not even been mentioned among the numerous candidates for the position- (The two most talked of were General MAST, former Governor of Tunis, and General CATROUX, a former Governor of Indochina and recently French Ambassador to Moscow). Pignon is a career colonial official just over 40 years of age who has spent most of his service in Indochina. In 1948 he had been Commissaire de la Republique (provincial governor) for Cambodia when he was called to Paris for a responsible job in the Ministry of Over-seas France. His appointment is generally considered as indicating the intention of the Cabinet to keep closer control over developments in Indochina.
The new High Commissioner spent the first weeks after his ap-pointment in Paris, arrived in Saigon on November 21, and returned to Paris on December 11, 1948. His brief stay in Indochina was chiefly occupied in bolstering up the bettering Xuan Government. A more detailed account of his activities since assuming office will be found in the main section of this paper.

American Consulate General, Saigon, Indochina, February 12, 1949*
MEMORANDUM ON INDOCHINA FOR NEW DELHI FOREIGN SERVICE CONFERENCE SECTION II. UNITED STATES IJFORiATION SERVICE
A.	Need for USIS in Indochina
No American news service reaches Indochina. UP service to Indo-china ceased in December 1948 because it could not meet expenses. AP is negotiating with the Bureau of Press and Information of the French High Commissariat for Indochina, but even if AP succeeds in selling its service to the Bureau, that organization will translate, select and edit whatever AP material it sees fit to pass on to the public through press and radio.
Agence France Presse service is distributed in Indochina under the Bureau’s supervision. The Burcau naturally concentrates on pre-senting the French point of view and on excluding all news which might disturb the population or be inimical to French policy. News of the United States and of the United Nations reaches the public here badly truncated or not at all.
Against this background, USIS Saigon should be disseminating the full facts on United States policy. Here is an illustration of this mission. The French in Indochina have admired the Dutch "police action" of last December in Indonesia. The Indochinese press, lacking adequate news sources, at first misinterpreted beyond recognition the United States' attitude toward that action. If the Department's wire-less bulletin were being received here, it would have been possible to provide the papers and Radio Saigon promptly with the full texts of the Department's January releases on Indonesia and of Mr. JESSUP's statements of United States policy. Though delayed, this material did reach here by pouch from Bangkok and has been brought to the attention of friendly journalists. As will be explained below, ef-forts are being made to begin copying the wireless bulletin in Saigon. The British Consulate General distributes a small daily wireless bulletin mimeographed in English on both sides of a single legal size sheet.
American and other English language books are not on sale in Indo-china. There has been very little English taught here. Nevertheless, the public, whether Vietnamese, French, or Chinese, is acquiring some English and is eager to learn about the United States and its culture and achievements. The large, steady attendance at the Reading Room is evidence that USIS’ stock of books and publications fills a need and at the same time contributes to American prestige
B.	Current Activities
Since USIS Saigon first opened a temporary Reading Room on August 26, 1946, there have been periods of inactivity imposed by problems of space and personnel. The present Reading Room opened its doors on August 13, 1947- It has a popular corner location on the
main

main business street of Saigon. The chairs r.re comfortable., the shelves attractive, and the Vietnamese attendants are efficient and courteous. The stock of books is modest (just over 1,000), but interesting new accuisitions arc flowing in. Daily uttcnicuco of readers and visitors cxceodS 200 (average 5,000 per month) and is in tho ratio of more than 3 Asiatics to 1 European. There is also a British Reading Room in Saigon, but it suffers from a very inconvenient location and lacks staff. Attendnnco at the British Reading Roon is only a small fraction of that enjoyed by USIS.
From March 7, 1943, when Yrs. Jeanne SKUJES, a public affairs assistant temporarily in charge of USIS, Salgen, was ambushed and killed, until the arrival of thc present Information Officcr on November 12 there was no American personnel attached to USIS Saigon. However, thc Consul General instructed a vice consul, Mr. Dallas IN CCOES, to give such attention tc tho conduct of a "holding operation" at USIS as would bo consistent with the performance cf his other duties. Thc previous American director of USIS Saigon resigned on January 15, 1948. The present director arrived one year lr.tor, cn January 13, 1949.
Thanks to tho effective work cf Ur. Coors r.nd cf the small and dcvoteu Tic tn* me-sc staff, thc two American officers new at USIS have taken over a going concern which provides, in addition to the P.cnding Roon, weekly film showings in a hall leaned by the Purcau of Press and Information, a system for lending films and projectors to schools and organizations, the distribution of American periodicals to a care-
fully selected list, thc g
distribution of wartime stocks cf paper-
bound C’Jl books end Army textbooks, and a little cultural exchange work. Thc periodicals and wartime books arc mailed or shipped to pcrsonS and institutions in mr.y parts of Indochina. USIS has reason to believo that some of this mtcrial filters into areas under Viot iiinh (rebel) control.	-
Plans to monitor and distribute thc wireless bulletin have gone on for r. long time and arc now being pushed. The present stumbling
block is trie lack cf office space to accommodate the wireless equip-
ner.t and operator and the cnployoos and machines to take cc.ro of duplication, distribution, and eventual translation of the bulletin. Office space is extremely scarce in Saigon, but USIS is leaving no stene unturned in search of it.
Small bulk subscriptions to
Newsweek, and Life (25, 27 and
19 copies respectively) arc roceivcd horc TPacific editions) and dis-tributcd by USIS to a sclectod list including friendly journalists. Tho Information CffiCor distributes ncws items and photos received

bo appreciated and published. As this press program has just been revived (lack of personnel has cnu-cd its suspension), it is too early to rensure its effectiveness. Several local papers, Vietnamese, French and Chinosc language, arc printing USIS material, chiefly
photos and nl.stic cuts.

C.	Particular Problcms Encountered in In.loc.hinn
The civil war in Indochina and tho' fast that Saigon for all its charm is a besieged city have a direct bearing on thc day to day activities of USIS. Among Frenchmen in Indochina thc belief persists that thc United States wishes for economic reasons to supplant French power and influence hero. These factors have in thc past led to official French protests against one or another activity of USIS.and still condition its functioning. Two plain clothes men habitually loiter near tho entrance to tho Reading Room. Aside from the question of whether anyone is actually nolcstci for attending tho American Reading Room, tho prcsoncc of these dotcctivcs may cause some interested persons to stay away.
Tho showing and lending of films is encumbered with controls and red tape. To bo. shown at all a film must have been granted a "visa" by thc Bureau of Prcss and Infcrmation. Anyone wishing to borrevr films for showings must have tho specific approval of thc Bureau. For instance, an ormer of rubber plantations requests USIS in writing to place his plantations on tho list for regular film loans. Ho states that thc audiences will consist of Vietnamese employees, French supervisors, local guards, and French soldiers, USIS writes to thc Bureau, encloses a copy of tho Icttcr from the plantation ormer, and asks approval. This is granted promptly, and USIS is thon free to circulate films, each of which must have boon "visaod" to tho plantations in question. Although the precise effect cannot bo estimated, these formalities must act as a brako on applications to borrow USIS films*	.
Thc Director of thc Bureau of Prcss and Information has statcd informally that application for permission to issue tho wireless bulletin must bo made to him in writing. Ho added that he would z	immediately grant approval. Nevertheless, this required procedure
illustrates thc closc control exorcised over printed ratter. Thc French author-tics will certainly protest against and endeavor to stop any USIS activities to which they take objection. Expansion • of tho program hero or additions to the American staff of USIS must bo carried out with circumspection in order to avoid suspicion and obstruction.
Thc shortage of office space is ncconnaniod by a scarcity of living accommodations. Thc unsolved and harassing housing problems of thc two American couples arc cvidcr.ce that some tins must elapse before even ?. thirl American is assigned to USIS Saigon. On thc other hand, additional local personnel will bo employed as soon as additional office space is obtained. This prospoctivo increase in '	local staff will, in addition to producing the wireless bulletin,
enable USIS to czpand tho distribution of photo exhibits and to sot up a lending library cf recorded music.
•.	Thc present possibilities of exchange of persons working hero are
severely limited. A few students have applied for scholarships- at American universities, USIS hr.s forwarded thcir applications. Certain advcrso factors exist independontly o.f thc civil war and of
tho impossibility .	•	•	176	*	'

the impossibility of obtaining dollar exchange. Very few Vietnamese arc sufficiently wealthy under any circumstances to send their children half way around the world tc college. The implementation cf tho Ful-bricht agreement with France is being worked out in Paris. It seems probable that this implencntation will place Indochinese applicants in direct competition with those in' France, In that case there is not likely to bo any political discrimination against Victnamose or other Indochinese applicants. Thay will, however, constitute but a small fraction of those applying in French territory and will rarely posscss accomplishments permitting them to meet the competition of students from Franco itself, It will bo recalled that the Fulbright program is designed for graduate students.
Hanoi is undor more intense siege than So.igon, and has experienced more dostruotion. A vcry modest USIS program, limited primarily tc mr.gazinos and some film distribution, is about to be launched by tho Consulate there. Thc possibility cf expanding this program will bo subject to periodic review. Present plans arc for the Consul and Vico Consul to depte some of their time to USIS activities, assisted by ono or two Vietnamese employed nt USIS cxpcnsc. The possibility of oponing a small reading room nt Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is being considered.
Despite tho accclorctcd tempo of events in China, Indonesia, lhlayn, and Burma, thc situation in thc French-held areas of Indochina has boon relatively static for some time paSt. This report has boon written in tho light of this static situation. Current French negotiations with ox-Empcror Bao Dai of Annam my lead to his early return to Vietnam with a trend toward more peaceful ccn-ditions in Indochina which would permit expanded USIS activities. Tho single factor of improved transportation facilities would be an immense advantage. If, however, conditions bccomo more unsettled, USIS will soon bo adversely affoctod.	'	•

MEMORANDUM Ch INDOCHINA FOR NET DELHI FQ-EICN SERVICE CONFERENCE
SECTION t IM M 'LI TAPA SITUATIA: IN IliDOCKII-iA
Summary	-	.	•
The war in Indochina, r.x: in its third year, has continued its indecisive course during thc past si, monthc. Ths usual full and winter campaigns, more limited in scope than last year, resulted in the reoccupation of r.banaormd towns c—d the usual capture of stocks of arms . and explosives, without my iecisivc result. Thc truism that "there is no military solution" for Indochina in more portincnt now than ever, with 100,000 French troops, over 30;S IndochincEc. Senegalese, Foreign Legion or othor mercenaries, hardly :rrc than ndequute to hold thc present very limited nrcas of control. In this stalemute, largc scale Chinese Communist intervention or the complcto bi’eakdovm of present political negotiations lending to self-government would have a serious, if not disastrous, effect on thc present French military position.
Eiatsiz
Since early in 1946 a succession of French gcnorals (including Le Clone and Valluy, two of tho ablest) have tried uhcir hand at pacifying Indochina. .A high point in tho scries of campaigns was reached in Ncvcmbor 1947, with a successful fall campaign in Tonkin that dealt u sovero and unexpected blow to tho Viet Minh. Thc French were unable to consolidate their advantage, however, and by December 1947 were boing counter-attacked all along the lino, finally being forced to withdraw virtually to their original positions.
In spite of subsecuont raids or combined operations into Viet Minh held territory, thc initiative has remained with the no Government, together with control of most of the country.	•
Current Situation - Tonkin
The past few .months have s-cn two operations in Tonkin. The first, “Operation Cndinc", was designed to cut off tho mountainous "northern-redoubt” from the rich rice producing delta. It involved a five battalion, combined paratroop, land and river epemtion to scizc Sen Tay, Vietri 'nd the line Sen Tay - Hanoi. No resistance w.s met in thc- initial stages and no Viet stores were found. Harassing counterattacks along th:- porimter of this 20 mile snlicnt make it already appear doubtful if it can hc hold during the rainy season.
Tho second Tcnkin operatic, began cn S Dccombcr and had the line 'fan Dinh - Phu Ly - Hadong as its objective, together with a "clean up" of thc- strongest conter cf rcsistance and arms supply in tho Delta. Paratroops, infantry '-.nd Lnrincs wo.o used, heavy resistance met, and
.	J_78	considerablc

considerable stocks of munitions and supplies were scized. Sine- the Num Dinh - Phu Ly - Hccong line is entirely surrounded by Viet Minh held area and had tc be supplied by air or river-boat, French withdrew from tho area when objectives had been reached, operation ending 21 January.
Central and South Annan
This relatively tranquil sector erupted on 16 January 1949 with a large scale Viet Minh attack on the Tourc.no - Hue railroad resulting in destruction of the train and capture of thc manager of the railroad. Previously only routine French clcr.n-up .operations have boon noted during thc past six months in thc narrow, hundred-mile-long coastal strip hold by French forces in central Annam. As in South Annam, an attenuated chain of small fortn and blockhouses, manned by second-line troops, is subject to intermittent and admittedly nerve-wracking attacks. This attrition, plus miserable living and sanitary conditions has reduced morc.lo and initiative in both Central r.nd South Annan sharply.
Cochinchina
Throe fairly able gonorc.ls, LE CLERC, liYO, and Boyar DE LA TOUR DU MOULIN, have tried their'hc,nd at pacifying Cochinchina, but in almost three years the situation has remained virtually unchanged. Tho French hold all tho largo towns and a small network of roads radiating from Saigon tc thc north, west and northwest quite firmly, although attacks even within this limit rd framework arc frequent and sometimes severe. Boyend it, in spito of missive swoops and encirclements, paratroop and amphibious operations, thc countryside remains in Viet Minh control. Tho "Plaine des Jones" area ’.vest and south of Saigon and the wholc rich, rice-growing Ca lhu peninsula rcrr.in particularly strong centers of Viet resistance. Tho latest reported French plan for thc Ca Mnu peninsula is to permit no rice to bo exported from it, in spite of world rice shortages, so solidly is its economy controlled by the Viet Minh.	‘	’
Cambodia and Laos
These large, sparsely-inhabited, deficit areas use up large numbers of French and Indochinese garrison troops to protect terms and communications from an insignificant Independence movement which draws most of it’s strength from Siam and thc Viet Minh. Important operations on the part of either adversary arc very rare, although large scale Froe Laos oporatior.s are roportcd planned for late February.
Troops	.
Current estimates give a tctul of 100,000 French troops for all of lndcchim. Of these, almost 50f are believed to be Indochinese natives, undor French officers and non-coms. Total white French .troops, including cadres,- r.rc not believed to exceed 2Cjt of the total cr about 20,000. 12,COO Foreign Legion and a mixture cf Senegalese, Norrocans, Algerians, Tunisians, together with a few Pondichcry ’ linns, ma! u-tho Illancc, A rogiment of French Marincs also servo an infantry combat troops with tho French ground forces.

Native anti-Viet Minh movements such as Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, Partisans, etc. have been virtually written off as an asset, and in the case of the latter two groups have become an admitted liability.
Morale and discipline in all combat units visited during past months showed a sharp decline over the past year, particularly among paratroop units. Widespread atrocities have been reported by American and British sources in the North; health and sanitary conditions in the field were observed to be very bad; and there is a widespread lack of confidence in both the French government at home and French general-ship in Indochina among officers and superior non-coms. Feeling the general hopelessness of the military situation, many of the albest young officers are seeking staff rather than combat duty, and only the most recently arrived French troops show ntuch combat enthusiasm or smartness of discipline. In this connection, Viet Minh propaganda makes much of an alleged recent proclamation by Andre MARIE, French Minister of Justice, offering French convicts a chance to "redeem" themselves by joining the Colonial Army to fight in Indochina.
The pay of officers and superior non-coms, however, is good to excellent, particularly in comparison with metropolitan France; professional advancement and decorations frequent; and these factors have inhibited widespread resignations or desertions.
Generalship	,
The present two top generals in Indochina (BLAIZOT and ALLESANDRI) are thought by French officers to be decidedly second rate, although served by a first rate General Staff. Area commands (KOCH in Tonkin, LE BRIS in Annam, DE LA TOUR in Cochinchina) are little more than autonomous sector commands. All large scale plans and decisions are made in Saigon by Allesandri and staff, with some interference by the High Commissariat, particularly on the political implications of military moves.
The Navy
With a single carrier, a cruiser, a dozen colonial sloops, three LST's, 16 minesweeps, and a variety of small landing craft at its dispostion, the Naval Command in Indochina is a minor military factor. Its functions are: river and coastal patrol (anti.-arms and rice smuggling); transport and support of troops in amphibious operations, and protection of river convoys. A regiment of Marines (Fusiliers -Marins) while officered by the Navy is under Army operational command. They are recognized as the best combat infantry in Indochina at present.
The Air Force
Some 36 out-dated German Junker transports (JU52’s) used for paratroop operations, are the backbone of the French Air Force in Indochina. Additional planes are old Spitfires and C-47's, plus light observation and personnel planes such as Piper Cubs. Besides transport of paratroops, the mission of the Air Force is the bombing and strafing of yi11 ages not in French control, support of ground troops and personnel transport.
As in
180

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
As in the Navy, promotions and decorations are slow, and morale and maintenance have both fallen off sharply in the past months. Pilots particularly resent lack of ground facilities, and various safety devices which those trained in the U.S. (over 50^) there learned to regard as indispensables.
The Viet Minh
Opposed to the French forces are about 75,000 Vietnamese troops of various political complexions, largely under Communist dominated leadership. There is considerable French-furnished evidence of Communist political commissars and indoctrination extending down to company strength levels. It is certain that the disciplined Communist element has been the largest factor in maintaining the vigor and cohesiveness of the resistance. In this, they have been greatly helped by French indecision and bad faith, and the terrorism of French troops.
In spite of arms captures and occasional defections, there is no sign of large scale weakening of Vietnamese resistance abilities or morale. The large areas under Vietnamese control lack luxuries and medicines, but are wholly self-sufficient in the basic necessities and tolerably well administered, according to what few reports are available. They continue to form a source of supplies and of fresh troops that are only limited in numbers by the arms available.
Although there are rumors of a Chinese Communist treaty with Ho Chi Minh, and of a Chinese Communist general and his staff in Northern Tonkin, there is little evidence, as yet, that the Chinese are of any considerable help in the resistance. French sources feel that there is little danger of a Chinese Communist 5th column in Cochinchina, or of an invitation on the part of Ho Chi Minh to the troops of the age-old national enemy to enter Indochina in force, in spite of the Communist link. All French military sources consulted, however, feel that a large scale Chinese Communist invasion would make most, if not all, of Tonkin, militarily untenable.
For many months past, observers feel that the resistance has not put forth its maximum effort, perhaps because the leaders are waiting for the outcome of political negotiations going on between the High Commissariat, the French Government and the Xuan-Bao Dai elements. If these should break down, the resistance will be greatly strengthened by the adhesion of many now neutral or pro-French elements. If the negotiations are successful, the resistance army is sure to be a dominant factor in any form of Vietnamese self-government.
Comment
Having long since explored, and exhausted, the possibilities of a final military victory in Indochina, there is little incentive for the French military high command to plan beyond small scale operations of limited scope, while waiting for the politicians in Paris and Mao Tze TUNG in China to make the really decisive moves.

MEMORANDUM OR INDOCHINA FOR HEW DELHI FOREIGN SERVICE CONFERENCE
.	SECTION IV. INDOCHINESE ECONOMIC SITUATION	.
A.	General .	■ again
Indochina has ?.n area of 283,000 square miles - half/as largo as France - and a population of about' 26,000.000. Tho population is largely concentrated in the deltas of tho Rod and Mekong Rivers and a narrow strip along the coast. Large parts of the interior are practi-enlly uninhabited. Thc economy of the country is primarily agricultural and largely based on thc growing, processing, and export of rico. Rubber output wus increasing rcpidly before the war, and some progrcss had been made in developing tho country’s mineral resources.
Recovery since tho war has been slow because of the practically continuous guerrilla wnrfnro. Even with tho return of poaco it will probably take two years for production in most fields to reach prewar levels, and largo capital investmants would be necessary.
B.	Resources
1.	Agr5 culture
Rico is thc mainstay of thc native diet and by far the most important crop. Tonkin is only self supporting in exceptional years; Annam and Cambodia usually break evcn; while Cochinchina can produce a large surplus for export and seldom suffers a crop failure. Agricultural mothods are primitive and yields per acre arc low* Other important crops arc corn, grown chiefly for export, sugar cane, boons, cotton, tobacco, and vegetables. Copra and oil seeds are of minor importanco as arc coffoo, tea, and kapok.
Rubber planting began lntc in Indochina and reached its greatest development in thc period 1925 - 19^4. Prcsont acreage is about 134,000 hectares, perhaps 20}s of which has been more or less seriously damagcd by thc guorrillas. Potential production is estimated at 100,000 tons, but many plant: tions have been abandoned because of insecurity, and the balance lack labor. Production in 1948 was only about 45,000 tons. Rubber is almost entirely in French hands and the great bulk in largo plantations - tho 33 largest contain COt of tho total acreage. French planters havo been prompt to develop and adopt modern methods, and over 40^5 of thc trccs arc from grafted and selected seedlings. It is undor-stood that cost of production is low compared with other growing regions.
2.	Anirnl husbandry, Fishing, and Timber
In tho Vietnam, cuttle and buffalo are raised chiefly for draft animals, and their number, arc still below prewar totals. Cambodia raises r, fair number of beef cattle. Hogs uro the most important food animal and in contain Annamitc provinces arc an important source of incomc. Gents and sheep arc of minor importance. Fish forms’ an

important part of thc native diet, and lc-r^j quantitios arc caught in tho coastal waters, thc rivers and pcrtiovlarly in thc Tonlc Sap Lake in C-rnbodin. Largo quantities of dried fish were formerly cxpcrtcd. Whilo Indochina has groat areas of forest and many valuable woods, thcxr exploitation is difficult and timber has never boon an important export. The cutting of construction timber and firewood is, however, an important local industry.
t
5, Minerals
Tho provinces of Tonkin and Laos are rich in minerals, thc latter largely uncxploited. High quality.anthracite coal deposits arc found north of Haiphong, and bcfoio the war production reached over 2,000,000 tons a year mostly by open cut mining. Production in 19-18 vacs only 340,000 tons duo to lack of machinery and labor and guerrilla activities. Coking coal is found only in insignificant quantities.
There arc valuable tin deposits in North Tonkin and Central Laos. Production reachod 1300 tons in 1938. Considerablc crude tin was also brought down from Yunnan, China, for smelting at Haiphong, Production is at presort at n standstill due to thc guerrilla warfare. A few tons wore flown out of Yunnan in 1943, but plans for developing this have boon postponed bocr.use of thc present high price,of Chinese tin. Tonkinese tin orcs contain tungsten, and production in 1938 reached 555 tons of concentrate.
There are valuable zinc orcs in Tonkin. Production reached 25,000 tons in 1926, but dropped to about 5.000 before thc war as world prices declined. These minos uro also closcd. Gold deposits wore worked at various points bcfore the war but were of minor im-portance.
Thcrc arc important dopes its of phosphate rock in northwes t Tonkin near thc Chinese frontier, the development of which was bcgun by the Japanese during the war. Exploitation of these rich mines will require not only tho pacification of tho area but large invcstmonts of capital.
Many other minerals, including iron nony, and graphite, r.ro known to exist, and boon partially prospected.
orc, bauxite, lead, antiLaos particularly has only
4. Industry
Industry is of little* importance in Indochina and is chiefly concoriiod with tho processing of agricultural and forest products. Tho most important manufacturing industry is tho cement works near Haiphong. This produced 260,000 tons bcfore tho v.r.r and about 100,COO in 1948* Othor minor industries produce alcohol, textiles, sugar, and cigarottes.

C. Foreign Trade
1.	Exports —,. . —-— _ 1
Bcfore thc rnr rico, rubber, and corn represontod 75^ of thc total value of' exports. Of other items, only coal, dried fish, tin and cement wore over lji of tho total.
Today rubber is tho leading export by value. Shipments totaled about 42,000 tons in 1948. This compares favorably with prewar but is loss than half of present capacity. Rico exports at 220,000 tons improved owr 1917 but were only a fraction of tho prewar average of over 1,500,000 tons. In 1933 over 500,000 tons of corn were exported, almost all to France. During thc war production practically ceased and has madc little rccovcry since. With tho decline in thc export of rico and corn, certain othor products such as hides and skins, soya and other banns, pepper, and kapok have assumed rdative importance.
The recovery of Indochinese exports to prewar levcls depends primarily on political factors and tho return of security. Howcvcr, such recovery would net occur immediately on thc return of neneo since much dostruction and cctcr lord ion has occurred which would take time to repair. Thus rico exports will be hindered for some time by failure to keep up dikes anil drainage or irrigation canals, lack cf junks to novo thc paddy, and destruction and deterioration of rico mills. Rubber could recover more quickly but- many trees have boon Slnshod or burned and factories and houses destroyed. Annual now or replanting schedules have been largely nbandonod since 1945. All export industries uro affcctod by tho gonoral deterioration of water, road, and rail transport.
Over GO;’!, by value, of Indochina’s oxports go to Franco and thc Empire, about tho samo as bcforc tho war. Most of thc balance goes to Singapore, Hong Kong, end China. Exports to thc United States amounted to only about cf the total value in thc first ten months of 1940. Thc pcrcontagc was somewhat higher before the war but has never boon largo and probably never will be unless the economy cf the country changes sharply. We do not import rice, corn, coal, or ccmcnt, while Indochinese rubber will normally go to Franco.
2.	Imports
Imports are madc up of tho usual selection of manufactured products which arc needed by a non-industrial country cf low per capita purchasing power. Duo to tho groat need for both consult ten and capital goods following six years of blockade, imports since the war have boon relatively high comonrcd with cxports and have recently exceeded prewar voluno.
Under tho prcwnr system of empire preference, France naturally supplied thc largest shcro of imports, 57,o in 1935. In spite of n change to non prcfcronce :,s far as import duties are concerned, Franco has "rintninO h.r position and supplied 60% by value in 1S47. Imports from thc United States have bean relatively larger since thc war and amounted tc lC—yJ in 1947. This droppod to H's in tho first ten months of 194B. Most of the balance came from China, Hong Kong, Siam, and India. ■ •	184

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
3.	Balance of Trade
From 1906 until the war Indochina had a favorable balance of trade except in 1923, 1931, and 1932. The balance has now sharply changcd and from January to October 1948 imports were valued at 1,764 million piastres and exports only 926, a deficit of 838 million. The foreign exchange problem is thus acute, particularly as concerns dollars. The deficit has been made up by France under the plan for the French Union. The failure to include Indochina for direct allotments under the Marshall Plan resulted in considerable delay in the 1948 Plan, and it is only in recent weeks that certain dollar allotments have been approved. Most imports from the United States in 1948 were delayed shipments under the 1947 Plan.
The ambitious ten year plan for the reconstruction and equipment of Indochina foresees large investments of capita! <, The present administrators of the plan expect most of this capital to come from government sources, and there is little place for private capital, either French or foreign. It is probable that present plans will have to be considerably modified to fit the new political conditions now developing.
4.	Finance and Currency
Internal finances are in relatively good shape in spite of the critical foreign exchange problem. The central government has derived its chief income from customs fees, excise taxes and monopolies, of which the opium monopoly is the most lucrative. Subsidies were granted to provincial governments from the central budget.
During the past year a number of changes have taken place in preparation for the new political organization. The bank note monopoly has been taken from the powerfuLBanque de 1*Indochine and is being transferred to a new Emission Institute. A separate Indochinese Treasury has been authorized, while the revenues from the excise taxes and monopolies were technically transferred to the Associated States on January' 1, 1949- All these measures contemplate a closely knit economic federation for Indochina in which French participation and influence trill be prominent. The individual states, particularly the Vietnam, are strongly opposed to this, and lengthy and bitter disputes trith the French on economic and financial matters can be anticipated.
The Indochinese piastre was worth 10 francs from 1934 until 1946 when the rate was changed to 17. The rate of 6.95 piastres per dollar became 12.55 as a result of the French devaluation of January 1948. In October 1948 the system of a double exchange rate was extended to Indochina, the official rate remaining at 12.55 per dollar and the "free" rate fluctuating with the free franc. Current quotations are about 19 per dollar. Foreign trade transactions take place at the average of the two rates or about 15.70. The black market rate rose during 1948 from around 40 to about 55 per dollar. Even better rates are occasionally reported from Hong Kong and Bangkok.
5.	Cost
* It is difficult to convert these figures to dollars due to two devaluations during the period. Foreign trade is now conducted at about 15.7 piastres per dollar, the average between the official rate of 12.55 and the free rate of about 19.

5.	Cost of Living
Thc cost of living has mounted rapidly since thc war, and thc index for Europeans in December 1948 was 2646 (first half 1939 ~ 100) compared with 1G38 a year earlier. Comparative figures for native working clcsscs woro 3966 and 2802. For Americans attempting to operate at thc "froo" exchange rate, prices arc outrageous.
Salaries tend to lag behind prices with resulting unrest among the working population and thc large class of civil servants.
6.	Conclusion
Thc basic problems of the economy of Indochina arc similar to
those of other Asiatic countries, with any increase in tho standard of living tending to be checked by the rapid rise in th; population, (Cambodia is an exception in that the population is static.) Thc development of the mineral resources and the industrialization of the country will rcquirr enormous amounts of capital and much time.
The immediate problem of restoring peace and order is primurily a political one-

SECTION V. CONSULAR AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS • . \ -
Administration
A problem which confronts all small offices, no doubt, is tho unusually heavy load of administrative work in proportion to tho amount cf creative work.turned out. Tho requirements of tho Dcpo.rt-ment for administrative reports, and tho quantity of administrative detail involved in tho daily operation of a small office is roughly thc same as for a large office. Thc administrative instructions end thc forms proscribed arc naturally drnftad with large offices in mind, * and their use in a small office is difficult and results in a dis-proportionatc amount of time spont on administrative work.
It is urged that tho Department investigate this matter with a view to giving additional authority to the field to make decisions and also to transferring to tho Department much of tho "control" rccords and reporting that is new demndod of thc field.
Alien Staff	•
Saigon has boon oxpcrioncing considerable trouble in finding and keeping alien personnel, particularly French, employees. Business houses o.ro in a position to offer better salaries and a shorter work wcok, and thc Consulate has been unable to compctc. Recommendations have recently been sent to Washington which, it is hoped, will sonc-v.’hct ameliorate this situation. A single; wage including basic wage and temporary increase has been suggested, which will be semi-annually adjusted according to changes in the co.st of living index. At tho same time c position classification systcm has boon astablishod which allows in-grade promotions for merit and service.
To cncouraro thc alien staff to continue its work with thc Gevern-ment, and to make thorn more valuable to thc office, it is hoped that some- way can bo found within budget limitations to provide language and stenographic Icssor.s for those mcmbcrs of tho staff who appear to bo qualified. Stenographers arc almost impossible; to find in Saigon, and it is, therefore, ncccssnry for officers to consume much valuable time in drafting corrospondonco for typists. Tho cost of such trc.in-inr is nominal, thc time allowed during working hours for tho study
• would be nogligiblo, and tho results undoubtedly satisfying.
Supplies and Shipping ---------------- .
Saigon for.morly cxpcricnccd sorious losscs in shipments of of-ficinl supplies and personal effects through short shipments, theft, and breakage. It was found that clearing agents usually took little intcrost in consular shipments since ns r. rule they are srr.ll and tho roturn for tho time and effort spent on clearing doos not .."arrant making the cxtra effort to supervise carefully our shipmcntc. *T'nc Consulate was still spending much time on each shipment in arranging
187	for
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
for tho free entry of tho goods and assisting the clearing agent.
It has been found that a considerable sum of money can be saved by training an alien employee to handle the entire clearance. Ila has sufficient official standing to permit him to ezp-dito papers and clearance procedures that would otherwise take days, and by devoting his full time to thc clearing of thc shipment and moving thc goods quickly losses have been cut to a large oxtent.
Nail and Courier Servico
Saigon has been experiencing considerable delay in the transmission of pouch mail, both courier and unaccompanied air pouches. It is necessary to allow up to three weeks for thc transmission of mail to the Department. It is possible that other offices in this area have been experiencing thc same difficulty, and it is suggested that a concerted effort be nado to encourage the Department to work out a more expeditious way to handle rail to and from Southeast Asia. Sea pouches take a minimum cf six weeks to roach Saigon.
It is not safe to send personal correspondence of any importance through tho open rail in Indochina. In spite of firm denials there is adequate proof that a form of censorship exists. This delays mail, and encourages thc loss of enclosures and small packngcs.
Visitors to Indochina
I
It is again desired to point out to neighboring offices that Saigon is not able to guarantee accommodations to visiting business mcn, and only with great difficulty and with ample notice- can ac-commodations bo arrangcd for official visitors. A critical housing situation is not peculiar to Saigon. However, consular residences here arc small and with the exception of thc consul general’s residence do not possess guist rooms. Even a confirmed reservation usually moans a bed in a dormitory with from throe to ten people.
Many unofficial travelers have been giving the Consulate C-encral as a reference when applying for an entry visa. Tho Frcnch officials call at the Consulate General anticipating that wc will give a guaran-tcc of lodging. This, of course, is not possible, and it is, thcrefore, again urgqd that businessman and tourists be warned that there may not bo any accommodation available in Saigon and that they should make no attempt to com to Indochina unless they are assured in advanco of lodging.
Consular
General
Saigon concurs with Batavia that some effort should bo mc.de- to provide nn operations manual for ouch consular office. Net; officers coming to tho field for the first time, even after a training period in Washington, find it most difficult to fnmili’rizc themselves '.rith their work. Ofton they arc replacing someone who has already left

the post or who lcavcs shortly after his arrival. It is impossible-to assimilate all thc details of procedure in a short time, and for ' this reason dotailcd operating instructions should be made available.
Thc precedent filo gives much valuable information about conditions peculiar to one particular post, however, for instructions regarding shipping, seamen, visas, and passports cr notariats, a detailed guide is osscntiql. ln a small post an officer may never, during his tenure, have occasion to issue certain types of visas or experience unusual shipping and seamen problems. But occasionally those situations do arise, and an unczpcricnccd officer has no recourse but to refer tc some guide for assistance.
.	The Foreign Service Regulations arc, of courso, the basic
manual. Experience has proven, however, that thc sections on visas, passports, shipping and scam.cn, immigration and notarials arc notico-ably inadequate when detailed instructions arc roquired. In thc interest of efficient office routine and tho proper execution of consular cuties within the bounds of cur present budget limitations, which makes it essential to operate with a small staff and a maximum of productive effort, it is urged that these portions of thc rcgu-lations bp re-examined with a view to improving their content so that they ray serve as a helpful guide.
_ • ' • Telegram Ratos
This post also agrees with Batavia that a concerted cffcrt should bo made to obtain reductions in telegraph rates between posts in this region. It is dc-Sired to point out to neighboring posts that there is considerable delay in transmission of tolegrams botvreon countries since radio circuits are open only once or at most twice a day, usually at night. Thus persons traveling by air to Saigon often reach here before thc telegram announcing their arrival.	•

There is transmitted herewith a memorandum sotting forth the Deportment’s views on the agreement signed on March 8 by the President of France and tho former Emperor of Annam defining tho future status of tho State of Vietnam. You are requested to prosent this memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of tho French Government.
It is suggested that the Ember-y^ noto transmitting thc memorandum bo composed along tho following lines:
’’The Embassy of the United Staten of America presents its compliments to iho Ministry of Forel oh Affairs and. on instruction from its goVernmont, has tho honor to transmit herewlth oertain. comments of the Department of State on the agreement concluded. on March 8S 1949, botweon tho President of tho French Republic and the former Emperor of Annam, which tho Ministry of Foreign Affaira was kind enough to make available to tho Government of tho United StatesA
Ao an alternative, the presentation of tho note by Mr. Charles E. Bohlen may appear prof'erablo. Tho prub-. lems dealt with in tho memorandum were discussed in a conversation.with the Secretary of State shortly boforo his departure from Washington at which lir. Bohlen was prosent

March 8 agreement, then it must be supposed that the Communi st-dominated "Democratic Republic of Vietnam" will continue to receive the support of these Vietnamese.
Certainly as long as the Vietnamese are persuaded that the t
two-and-a-half-year-old war with France must be prosecuted to a conclusion if the goals for which they have fought are to be won, they will continue to regard the dominant Communist element of the Vietminh League in the light of its effective leadership of the nationalist movement and not of its inevitable intention to subvert the nationalist cause in the end to the requirements of international Communism, with which they have had little acquaintance as yet.
The United States Government would be lacking in frankness if it did not state that in its considered estimation the paramount question in Indochina now is whether the country is to be saved from Communist control. Under the circumstances, all other issues must be regarded as irrelevant. Much time has already been lost. The years since the end of the Pacific War have seen the Communist threat to Indochina intensified rather than other-208

MEMORANDUM FOR THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
Subj:	United States Policy Toward Asia
1.	I am becoming increasingly concerned at the course of events in Asia. The adVance of communism in large areas of the World and particularly the successes of communism in China
;. seriously affect the .future security of the United States. I i am aware that this critical situation is being watched closely in the seVeral departments of the government, and I appreciate
I	that the. current problems are being handled as realistically
(as circumstances permit. It occurs to me, hOWSVer, that this day-to-day, country-by~country approach may not develop a broad program in our best long-range interests.
• i	.
2.	A major objective of United States policy, as I under • stand it, is to contain communism in order to reduce its threat to our security. Our actions in Asia should be part of a carefully considered and comprehensive plan to further that objec-
v 9 tive. I therefore request that the staff of the National Security Council undertake as SOon as practicable a study of the current situation in Asia to re-examine and correlate current policies and to appraise the commitments and risks involved in the Various courses of action—political, economic and military--which might bo undertaken in support of the broad objective and recommend for the consideration of the National Security Council an appropriate plan of action outlining specific objectives to be achieVed.

Following in substance are the recommendations made at the Singapore Conference in regard to Indo-China:
1.	A failure of the Bao Dai experiment‘would inavitably result in a complete French withdrawal from Indo-China; therefore U.S. and Commonwealth Governments should join the UK in assisting the French in support of Bao Dai.
2.	In view of the urgency of the situation Western nations cannot afford to await prior sponsorship of Bao Dai by the Asiatic nations. It is therefore recommended that after the transfer of sovereignty to Vietnam on January 1 the UK support the new regime.
3.	Following action is recommended:
a.	The French should be asked to clarify the legal status of the Vietnam.
b.	19 lUUO recognition is not possible until March 8th Agreement is ratified.
It is therefore recommended that de facto recognition of Vietnam be granted on the

THE POSITION CF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT.TO ASIA
THE PROBLEM
1.	To assess and appraise the position of the United States with respect to Asia* on the basis of our national security inter-ests.
ANALYSIS
General Consideratlons -
2.	The peoples and countries of Asia have in common a heayy pressure Of population on scanty or underdeVeloped natural re-! ) sources and a consequent meager standard of living: disruption experienced in the war: the Vigorous nationalistic spirit Which characterizes newly independent states or restive colonies: and
active discontent with their preyaillng social, economic and political institutions. In other Words the Asians share pOVerty, 1-
nationalism, and reVolution. The United states position With respect to Asia is therefore that of a rich and powerful country dealing With a have-not and sensitively nationalistic area, and of competition together with friendly countries against the USSR for *	I
influence on tho form and direction of the Asiatic revolutions. .
*For the purposes of this report "Asia" is defined as that part of the continent of Asia south of tho USSR and east of Iran together with the major off-shore islands--Japan, Formosa, the Philippines, Indonesia and Ceylon.

3.	Asia is an area of significant potential power--political, economic and military. The development in this region of stable and independent countries friendly to the United States and seeking to direct their potential power, into constructive channels would enhance the security of Asia and strengthen the world position of the United States. Conversely, the domination of Asia by a nation or coalition of nations capable of exploiting the region for purposes of self-aggrandizement would threaten the security of Asia
and of the United States, Recognition of these principles has been
implicit in our traditional policies toward Asia; We have consis-
tently favored a system of indepondent states and opposed aggrandizement of any potters which threatened eventual domination of the region.
4.	Our OVcr-all objective with respect to Asia must be to assist in the development of truly independent, friendly, stable and self-sustaining states in ^conformity With the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In order to achieve this,
we must concurrently oppose the domination of Asia by any single country or coalition. It is concciVable that in the course of time
a threat of domination may come from such nations as Japan, China
or India, or from an Asiatic bloc. But now and for the foreseeable
future it is tho USSR which threatens to dominate Asia through the complementary instruments of 'communist conspiracy and diplomatic pressure supported by military strength. For the foreseeable future, therefore, our immediate; objectiVe must be to contain and where feasible to reduce the power and influence of the USSR in

Political Considerations	J
5.	Asia is in the throes of political upheayal, Communist attempts to capture leadership of this revolution, nationalism and the reVolt against colonial rule, the emergence of new nations, the decline of Western influence, the absence of a stabilizing balance of power, the prevalence of terrorism, economic distress and social - unrest, and the repercussions of the struggle between the Soviet • world and the free World are currently disruptiVe forces. The conditions nov preyailing in Asia render the realization of United States objectiVes there difficult and facilitate expansion of tho area of both communist control and( SoViet influence.
6.	The USSR is now an Asiatic pover of the first magnitude With expanding Influence and interests extending throughout continental Asia and into the Pacific. Since the defeat of Japan, which ended a balance of power that had preViously restrained Russian pressures in China and the Pacific, the SoViet Union has been able to consolidate its strategic position until thc base of Soviet pover in Asia novi comprises not only the SoViet Far East, but also China north of tho Great Wall, Northern Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles.

•	war-making complex, were added to the Stalinist bloc, the SoViet Asian base could become a source of strength capable of shifting the balance of world power to tho disadvantage of the United States, t
Should India and Pakistan fall to communism, the United States and' its friends might find themselves denied any foothold on the Asian mainland.
7.	While tho military adyantages of this position to the USSR are great, tho general Far Eastern situation also giVes the USSR significant political advantages. In estimating the degree of

The political offensiV© of the Kremlin or its‘proteges also tends to gather additional momentum as each new success increases tho vulnerability of the next target.	•

• basically altered, and notable steps haye been taken toward tho ' development of democratic institutions and practices. Despite these advances, however, traditional social patterns, antithetical to democracy, remain strong. The'demonstrated susceptibility of t ' these patterns to totalitarian exploitation is enhanced by economic maladjustment which may grow more serious as a result of population increases and of obstacles to the expansion of trade.
9.	Although, in terms of the Japanese context, an extreme right-wing movement might be more effectiye in exploiting traditional patterns and current dislocations than one of thc extreme
• left, a number of factors combine to make the threat of Communism a serious one. Those factors include the close proximity to a ‘ r— weak and disarmed Japan of Communist areas With the attendant . opportunities for infiltration, clandestine support of Japanese Communist efforts, and diplomatic pressure backed by a powerful threat; the potential of Communist. China as a source of raw materials vital to Japan and a market for its goods; and the existence in Japan of an ably-led, aggressive, if still relatively weak, Communist moVement Which may be able to utilize Japanese tendencies toward passiV© acceptance of leadership tO further its driVC for pover while at the same time exploiting economic hardship to under. mine the acceptability to the Japanese of Other social patterns that are antithetical to Communist doctrines.

compelling the political and economic factors moving it toward *
accommodation to the Soviet orbit internationally, however anti-Communist its internal policies, than those that move it toward military alliance With the United States. Extreme right-wing domination of Japan, moreover, although loos immediately menacing to the United States than Communist control Would represent a failure, particularly marked in the eyes of other non-Communist Asiatic countries, of a major United States political effort.
11.	A middle of the road regime in Japan retaining the spirit of the reform program, even, if not necessarily the letter, would in the long-run proye more reliable as an ally of tho United States than Would an extreme right-wing totalitarian gOVcrnment. Under such a regime the channels Would be open for those elements in Japan that have gained most from the occupation to exercise their influence over goVernment policy and to mold public opinion. Such a regime would undoubtedly Wish to maintain normal political and I economic relations with the communist bloc and, in the absence of open hostilities, Would probably resist complete identification either with the interests of the United States or the SoViet Union. The existence of such a regime, hoWeter, will make possible the most effective exercise of United States political and econcmic influence in the direction of ensuring Japan’s friendship, its ability to withstand external and internal Communist pressure, and its further deVelopment in a democratic direction.

In NSC 8/2, approved by the President on March 23, 1949, it vras agreed that "if the significant gains made thus far, in terms both of the welfare and aspirations of the Korean people and of the national interest of the United States are to be consolidated, the United States Aust continue to give political support and economic, technical, military and other assistance to the Republic of Korea."

fully contain the threat of expanding Communist influence and control arising out of the existence in north Korea of an aggressive SoViot-dominated regime, and (2) serue as a nucleus for the eyentual peaceful unification of the entire country on a democratic basis.
14. It can be assumed that under present circumstances the communists haye the capability of dominating China. Communist domination of China is significant to the USSR primarily because it enhances USSR capabilities for obtaining SoViet objectives in Asia. Soviet ability to capitalize on the situation in China will depend on the degree of control that the Kremlin can exert OVor Chinese communist loaders, and on the control that the Chinese communists can exert OVer all elements of Chinese society. DeVelopment of ' • these two varieties of control Will not necessarily proceed in . parallel. The formidable problems of oVerpopulation, limited and undeVCloped natural resources, technical backwardness, and social and political lag Which confront.the Chinese communists have contributed to the downfall of eyery Chinese regime in recent history. Chinese communist success in surmounting their internal difficulties might well be accompanied by a lessening rather than an intensification of their subserVicnce to the Kremlin. Similarly Chinese communist failure to achieve an effective solution of China’s problems might drive the Chinese communists to depend more rather than less on the USSR. For the Very immediate future it may be assumed that both Kremlin influence on the Chinese communists and Chinese communist control over Chinn Will grow more firm and that China Will represent a political asset to the USSR in accomp-

lishmcnt of its global objectives. But longer range development of
* Kremlin influence oyer the Chinese communists will be subject to the interplay of such presently unpredictable factors as Chinese communist effectiveness, USSR policy toward the Chinese communists, t	•
and the relations between the Chinese communists and the noncommunist World. If the Kremlin should attempt to extend to China the pattern of political and economic control and exploitation that has characterized its relations With its European satellites, it is quite possible that serious frictions Would deVelop between the Chinese communist regime and Moscow. KoreoVer, an attempt by the • USSR to mobilise directly all Chinese resources in pursuance of its strategic objectiVes might well result in China’s becoming more of a liability than an asset to the SoViet Union. The actions of the
. United States or of other Western powers cannot be expected greatly to weaken Chinese communist control of China in the foreseeable future, but may have Influence on.the relations betveen the Chinese communists and the USSR, In fact, any attempt on the part of the United States openly to deny Chinese territory- such as Formosa to the communists Would probably react to the benefit of the communists by rallying all the anti-foreign sentiment in China to their side.
15. Furthermore, action by the U. S. to occupy Formosa Would inevitably expose the U. S. to charges of "imperialism" and seriously affect the moral position of t'he U. S. before the bar of world opinion, particularly in the Far East, at a time When the U. S. is seeking to expose SoViet imperialist designs on other nations. Such action would prOVide the Chinese communists with an irredentist

issue for their propaganda against the U. S. and a cause which -
would rally almost unanimous public sentiment behind them in China.
/	16. It is not belieyed that denial of Formosa to the Chinese
communists can be achieVed by any method short of actual U. S. <
ml11tar; occupation. As a CIA intelligence estimate of October 19, 1949 (ORE 76-49, concurred in by the intelligence organizations of the Departments of State, Army, Navy and Air Force) states;
"Without major armed intervention, U. S. political, economic, and logistic support of the present Nationalist island regime cannot insure its indefinite surVival as a non-communi.st base. Communist capabilities are such that only extended U. S. military occupation and control, of Taiwan can prevent its eventual capture and subjugation by Chinese communist forces. Failing U. S. military occupa-tion and control, a non-communist regime on Taivan probably will succumb to the Chinese communists by the end of 1950."
"	17. In the light of the foregoing, and in view of the estimate
of the JCS, reaffirmed in NSC 37/7 Of August 22, 1949, that "the strategic importance of Formosa does not justify overt military action. . .", it is believed that ,U. S. military occupation of Formosa, Which Would require concurrent responsibility for the administration of the Island, would not be in the U. S. national interest.
18.	On December 23, 1949, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that eVents which hare taken place in China haye not changed their above views (NSC 37/7, dated August 22, 1949). Hovever, within these limitations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that a modest, Well-directed and closely supervised program of military advice and assistance to the anti-Communist government in Formosa would be in the security interest of the United States, and should be integrated' with a stepped-up political, economic and psychological program

governments are non-corninunist and, except in Burma, are maintaining l&W and order and haye good prospects of remaining in povrer for the next few years. SoViet and Chinese communist hostility and internal communist opposition, on ths one hand, and friendliness and circumspection on the part of thc United States, the' United Kingdom and the other Western povrers, oh the other, have during the past two years strengthened the Western orientation of the south Asian goVernments.
20.	India and Pakistan, the piVOtal nations of the area, inherited from the British vzell trained armies, a corps of experienced ciVil administrators, transport and communications facilities well developed by Asian standards, important agricultural .and extractive industries, and a few large-scale processing and manufacturing industries. They, and Ceylon, remain within the Commonwealth and haye significant military, economic and

and suspicion of' India in varying degree among its smaller neighbors at the minimum impede essential regional cooperation. At the un-like ly maximum, they could embroil the area in war. Internally, all the goVernments of south Asia are faced With tho necessity of t
bringing to their peoples within the next few years at least some hope of improVed economic and social conditions. Failing this, they may lose control to extreme groups of the right or the left.
22.	Consideration of the foregoing unfavorable aspects of the south Asian situation together With the curxont reluctance of the area, to align itself oVertly With any "power bloc" leads to tho conclusion that it would be unvise for us to regard south Asia, more particularly India, as the sole bulwark against the extension — of communist control in Asia. We should, hoveyer, recognize that the non-communist goVernments of the area already constitute a
/ bulwark against communist expansion. We should accordingly exploit i ,
eyery opportunity to increase the'present Western orientation of south Ar’a and to assist, vrithin our capabilities, its non-communist governments in their efforts to meet the minimum aspirations of their people and to maintain (in the case of Burma to restore) internal security.
23.	The current conflict between colonialism and natiye independence is the most important political factor in southeast Asia. This conflict results not only from the decay of European imperial power in the area but also from a widening political consciousness and the rise of militant nationalism among the subject peoples.

. the southeast Asia countries do not possess leaders practiced in the exercise of responsible power. The question of Whether a colonial country is fit to.govern itself, however, is not always relevant in practical politics. • The real issue would seem to be i
Whether tho colonial country is able and determined to make continued foreign rule an oVerall losing proposition for the metropolitan power. If it is, independence for the colonial country is thc only practical solution, eVen though misgoVernment eVentuates. A solution Of the consequent problem of instability, if it arises, must bo sought on a non-imperialist plane. In any event, colonial-nationalist conflict provides a fertile field for subVersive communist actiVities, and it is now clear that southeast Aisa is the target of a coordinated offensive directed by the Kremlin, In seeking to gain control of southeast Asia, the Kremlin is motivated in part by a desire to acquire southeast Asia’s resources and communication lines, and tc deny .them to us. But the political gains Which Would accrue to the USSR from communist capture of southeast Asia are equally significant. The extension of communist authority in China represents a grievous political defeat for us; if southeast Asia also is swept by communism We shall have suffered a major political rout the repercussions of which Will be felt throughout the rest of the World, especially in the Middle East and in a then critically exposed Australia. The United States should • continue to use its influence looking toward resolying th© colonial nationalist comlict in such a vzay as to satisfy the fundamental demands of the nationalist-colonial conflict, lay the basis for

political stability and resistance to communism, and ayoid weakening ’ the colonial powers who are our western allies, Howeyer, it must be remembered that the long colonial tradition in Asia has left thc peoples of that area suspicious of Western influence. We must i
approach the problem from the Asiatic point of View in so far as possible and should refrain from taking the lead in movements Which must of necessity be of Asian origin. It Will therefore be to our interest wherever possible to encourage the peoples of India, Pakistan, the Philippines and other Asian states to take tho leadership in meeting the common problems of the area.

tion of the white nations of the Commonwealth will arrest any potential dangers of tho growth of a White-colored polarization.
25. With the rise of new nations and the decline of colonialism, a consciousness of common interests and a demand for regional collaboration is beginning to take form among the countries of Asia. HoweVer, the wide diversity of political organization and development, the lack of a tradition of cooperation and a sound economic • basis for large-scale mutual trade, and the suspicions with which the weaker nations of Asia, View the stronger, have all operated to ” delay the -formation of any regional organization up to the present. . But efforts continue and will probably increase in tempo us the adVance of SOViet influence becomes more and more a direct threat. As stated aboV© the peoples of Asia are suspicious of the West and in any cooperation the United States may extend to a deVGloping regionalism it .will be necessary to do nOthing Which would excite further suspicion of our motiVes. Asian leaders have already taken the initiaiiVe in this matter and it should continue to rest in their hands.

2)	. United States ability to exert counter influence against the Kremlin in Asia rests on U. S. ability to prouide economic assistance and cooperation to Asiatic countries; on preseryation
and deVolopment of the U. S. traditional reputation as a non-imperialistic champion of freedom and independence for all nations; on the frictions which trill arise botveen Asiatic nationalisms and USSR imperialism; on U. S. cultural and philanthropic contacts in Asia; on U. S. ability to exert constructive influence on the European Far Eastern colonial powers and to gain assistance from these powers in the Far East; on U. S. military power, and on the U.

Policy and what already exists in the way of will and ability to resist on the part of the Asiatic countries themselves. It must also be borne in mind that the sweeping changes which have been taking place in Asia since the war hatoe been stimulated in very t
considerable part by the determination of the peoples of Asia to
control their ovzn destinies and to redress thc grievances of the past which they associate With foreign rule and foreign influence. Intervention in their affairs, particularly by the Western potters, hovzoVer well-intentioned, will of itself be suspect and be likely to result in th© undoing of the very interests Which prompted the

' Strategic Considerations
29.	The potential potter of Asia is strategically significant both to the United States and to the USSR because of its capacity in the long run to affect the relative military strength of these two " 1 countries and hence the character of military operations in the eVent of war between them. Translation of the Asian "power potential into military strength Would require development of each of its elements--organization and training of manpover, exploitation of natural resources, development of sea transportation, improvement of communica-. tions and further industrialization--as vell as their integration toward coordinated objectives. EVen given the most favorable atmosphere for deVelopment, including the power to consolidate as neces-" -	sary, the authority to divert channels of trade, and the military
.	force required to protect long sea routes and other lines of communi-
cation--the full development of Asia's potential pover is a long-term affair. In the power potential of .Asia, Japan plays the most important part by reason of its industrious, aggressive population, providing a large pool of trained manpower, its integrated internal communications system with a demonstrated potential for an efficient merchant marine, its already deVeloped industrial base and its strategic position. Because of Japan's economic importance in Asia, of the extreme vulnerability of Japan to blockade, of the long period required under the best of circumstances for the development of significant strategic potential in Asia, and of the hazards inVolved in attempts to harness Chinese potential to SoViet ends, there exists no serious danger that the USSR Will in the near future be able to undertake mil. itary aggression based on Asia's strategic potential.

30.	The location of A.sia, contiguous to the USSR and separated from the United States, presents different strategic implications, both offensive and defensive, to the United States and to the USSR. The Asian pover potential is more•valuable to Russia than to the 1
United States, since American industrial pover is so much greater than Russian. The industrial plant of Japan Would be the richest strategic prize in the Far East for the USSR. For Japan and major Asian raw-material producing areas, together With the necessary transportation lines, to be controlled by the SoViet Union would add measurably to the war-making potential of the USSR. Russia could not, howeVer, quickly build up a poverful self-sufficient War-making complex in Asia Without access to and control over Japan and could not effectiVely mobilize Japan in War Without a larger merchant fleet in the Pacific than the USSR and Japan are likely to have for / years to come. Other Asiatic assets of potential value to Russia I , include soybeans, tin, rubber, and.South China's tungsten. Petroleum cor'ng from Indonesia including Borneo, While not essential to
I *
meet Russian domestic requirements, is one of the most important ' strategic materials in the region.
31.	The strategic value of Asia to the United States rests on three considerations: In the first place denial of USSR control OVer Asia might prevent the acquisition by the Soviets of elements of power Which might in time add significantly to the Russian var-making potential. Secondly, to the degree that Asian indigenous forces deVelop opposition to the expansion of USSR influence, they would assist •• the U. S. in containing SoViet control and influence in the area,

possibly reducing- the drain on tho United States economy. The indigenous forces of Asia, including manpower reserves, would also be a valuable asset, if.available for the support of the United States in the event of war. Thirdly, Asia is a source of numerous raw ma-< terials, principally tin and natural rubber, Which are of strategic importance to the United States, although the United States could, as in World War II, rely on other sources if necessary.
32.	Since, from the military point Of viev, the primary stra-tegic interests and War objectives of the United States consistent With the aim of destruction of the enemy's means to Wage war are not nov in Asia, the current basic concept of strategy in the event of War with the USSR is to conduct a strategic offense in the "West” and a strategic defense in the "East". In keeping With this basic concept and in light of the strategic interests of the United States and the USSR as developed above, certain principles may be stated. As a primary matter in the eVent of War, it is essential that a suc-cessful strategic defense in the "East" be assured With a minimum expenditure of military manpower and material in order that the major effort may be expended in the "West". In order to gain freedom of access to the Asian continent Within these limitations, the United States must now concentrate its efforts on bringing to bear such poWer as can be made available, short of the commitment of United States military forces, in'those areas Which will show the most results in return for the United States effort expended. In addition the United States must maintain a strategic position Which Will facilitate control of coastal and overseas lines of communication in Asia.

33.	From the military point of view, the United States must maintain a minimum position in Asia if a successful defense is to be achieved against future Soviet aggression. This minimum position is considered to consist of at least-our present military position in <
the Asian.offshore island chain, and in the eVent of war its denial to the Communists. The chain represents our first line of defense and in addition, our first line of offense from Which ve may seek to reduce the area of Communist control, using Whatever means We can develop, Without, howeVer, using sizeable United States armed forces. The first line of strategic defense should include Japan, thc
Ryukyus, and the Philippines. This minimum position Will permit con-trol of the main lines of communication necessary to United States - strategic development of the important sections of the Asian area. )
Economic Considerations
34.	Except for industrialization in Japan and to a lesser extent in India, Asia is basically an agricultural region. Pressure of population on the land has depressed living standards to the margin of subsistence. Communications and transportation facilities are poor and productivity is low. However, Asia is the source of import-ant rav -and semi-processed materials, many of them of strategic value, MoreOVer, in the past, Asia has been a market for the processed goods of industrialized states, and has also been for the Western colonial povers a rich source of revenue from investments and other invisible earnings.
35.	The United States has an interest in the attainment by the free peoples of Asia of that degree of economic recovery and develop-

ment needed as a foundation for social and political stability. This interest stems from the principle that a viable economy is essential to the survival of independent states. In the two major non-Commun-ist countries of this area, India and Japan, U. S. aid (direct in the case of Japan, and via conyertible sterling releases in the case of India) is averting a deterioration in economic conditions that would otherwise threaten political stability. While scrupulously avoiding assumption of responsibility for raising Asiatic living standards, it is to the U. S. interest to promote the ability of these countries to maintain, on a self-supporting basis, the economic conditions pre' requisite to political stability. Japan can only maintain its pres-
ent liVing standard on a self-supporting basis if it is able to se-needed
/ cure a greater proportion of its/food and rav material (principally '• cotton) imports from the Asiatic area, in Which its natural markets
lie, rather than from the U. S., in Which its export market is small. In view of the desirability of avoiding preponderant dependence on Chinese sources, and the limited availability of supplies from prevar sources in Korea and Formosa, this Will require a considerable increase in Southern Asiatic food and raW material exports.
36.	The Indian problem is someWhat analogous: The sizeable post-War Indian dollar deficit may be traced largely to this country’s unprecedented dollar food imports. These imports have been I
necessitated by the failure of Indian food production to keep pace With population groWth and to the reduced post-var availability of food exports from India’s soft currency suppliers in Southern Asia.
■' • EVen With these significant dollar food imports, Indian food con-

•sumption has falldn below pre-war levels. A further decline would almost certainly produce serious political instability in the major cities of India. A serious problem Would thus result if the U. K. •were no longer able to bear the burden of the convertible sterling releases that have so far met the Indian dollar deficit.
3)	. It is thus difficult to foresee a time at Which Japan and India Will be self-supporting in the absence of greatly increased food production and some increased cotton production in Southern and Southeast Asia. One major prerequisite to such an increase is the restoration of political stability in the food exporting countries of Burma ' and Indo China. Given such a restoration, perhaps as much as 2.5 million more tons of rice exports could be secured from these coun-^tries With only minimal loans for rehabilitation of damaged facili-'• ties, e.g., transportation. Another major prerequisite is expanded agricultural development in the stable Southern Asiatic countries in Which such deVelopment vould be economic: India, Pakistan -- Which exports Wheat and cotton, Thailand -- which exports rice, and Ceylon -- Whose sizeable rice imports reduce the availability of Asiatic foodstuffs to India and Japan. Japanese and lndian food requirements, and Japanese cotton requirements, could be met if certain projected Irrigation, reclamation, and transportation projects were executed in the aboVe countries. ,
38.	These projects Will probably require: (i) a more effective mobilization of local resources by the governments concerned, (ii) some external technical aid, (iii) some limited external finan-
• ^jdal aid. Most of the countries in question are now taking steps to '•	259

TOP SECRET mobilize local resources more effectiuely in the agricultural field, and they should be encouraged along these lines. External technical aid should be made available under the Point IV program. The external financial aid required is of such a limited character that it can t probably be adequately provided by the International Bank and the Export-Import Bank. We should, therefore, continue to urge these institutions to give serious consideration to requests for loans to fi-nanco sould deVelopment projects that Would increase agricultural production in India, Thailand, Pakistan and Ceylon. This encouragement should, of course, be Without prejudice to other additional loans these institutions may Wish to make for non-agricultural purposes to these countries.
39.	Expanded agricultural development in Southern and Southeast Asia Would make a contribution to the political stability and the ■welfare of the exporting, as Well as the Importing countries. Through increased sales of rice, Wheat, and cotton, Thailand and Pakistan could most economically secure the imports of capital and consumer goods to develop and diversify their economies. A. comparable effect Would bo felt in India and Ceylon, if increased food production enabled these countries to reduce the disproportionate amount of foreign exchange that they presently devote to the purchase of food imports.
40,	Our interest in a Viablb economy in the non-Communist countries of Asia Would be advanced by increased trade among such countries. Japanese and Indian industrial revival and deVelopment can .contribute to enlarged intra-regional trade relations Which suffered

;-a set-back because of the economic vacuum resulting from the defeat of Japan, the devastation caused by the war in other areas and the interference and restrictions arising from extensive governmental controls. Given a favorable and secure atmosphere--plus adequate t
freedom to individual traders, readily awailable Working capital, suitable commercial agreements establishing conditions favorable to commerce end navigation and general assistance in the promotion of trade--it is expected that a substantial increase in intra-Asia trade can occur. The patterns of such trade, howeVer, may differ from those existing before the war. In any ©Vent, a strong trading area among the free countries of Asia Would add to general economic deVel-opment and strengthen social and political stability. Some kind of’ /^regional association, facilitating interchange of information, among
the non-Communist countries of Asia might become an important means of developing a favorable atmosphere for such trade among themselves and With other parts of the World,,
41.	Asia, particularly South and Southeast Asia, are among the principal sources of United States imports of several basic commodi-tles Which could contribute greatly to United States security for stockpiling purposes and Would be of great assistance in time of War if they remained available to us. Exports to Asia from the United States are of less importance than are imports, but are not now in-significant and could.grow in impbrtance to the stability of our own domestic economy. In brief, the economic adVantage derived by the United States from our trade with non-Communist Asia is considerable land there is little doubt of the Wisdom of its development.

42.	One effective means ayailable to the United States for assisting in economic development, particularly in Southeast Asia, is to enlarge, consistent With security considerations, and despite possible objections of U. S. competitors, the orderly and sustained pro-t curement, both by private and public agencies, of strategic and other basic commodities, such as tin, hard fibers and particularly natural rubber. United States purchases of strategic materials on current account Would represent an important source of dollars for use by Asian countries in and outside the sterling area in meeting their current and capital needs.
43.	The USSR is the primary target of those U. S. economic policies designed to contain or turn back SoViet-Communist imperialism, and not China or any of the Soviet satellites considered as individual countries. It Would, therefore, be inappropriate to apply to the Willing or unvilling partners of the USSR punitive or restrictive economic measures Which are not being applied to the USSR itself. This guiding principle should be the point of departure in application of procedures for conduct of our economic relations With Communist China. It should be our objective to take steps to prevent the Soviets end their satellites from obtaining, Via trans-shipment in the Far East, strategic goods novr denied them through direct channels. It should also be our objective to prevent Chinese Communists from . obtaining supplies of goods of direct military utility which might be ' used to threaten directly the security interests of the Western powers /
in Asia. It is not, hoyever, either necessary or edVisable to re-xstrict trade With China in goods Which are destined for normal civll-

ian uses Within China provided safeguards are established to accomplish the two objectives mentioned above. Three reasons exist for this position: (1) Japan's economy cannot possibly be restored to a self-sustaining basis without a considerable volume of trade With
China, the burden of Japan on the United States economy cannot be re-1 moved unless Japan’s economy is restored to a self-sustaining basis
and U. S. Interference With natural Japanese trade relations with China vou_d produce profound Japanese hostility; (2) permitting trade With Communist China in goods destined for normal civilian end uses Within China Will enable us to obtain quantities of important commod-
• ities needed by the U. S. (e.g., tung oil, bristles, tungsten, anti-mony, etc.) and might contribute to internal economic and political
--.tensions between the urban and rural sectors of the Chinese economy, and permit China to choose betveen a Soviet and a Western orientation in their foreign economic relations; and (3) restriction of trade for any purpose other than those indicated by the objectives outlined above Would be ineffectiVe and impractical in view of the existence of alternatiVe sources of supply in other countries Which Will not cooperate in export controls affecting normal trade with China. The U. S. should seek the cooperation of friendly countries in exercising
export controls to achieve the objectiVes indicated, and request SOAP to conform to our general policy in this respect, 'While SCAP should be requested to avoid preponderant dependence on Chinese markets and sources of supply he should not bo expected to apply controls upon Japan's trade With China more restrictive than those applied by West-mn European countries in their trade with China, At the same time,

b.	DeVelopment of sufficient military power in selected non-Communist nations of Asia to maintain internal security end to prevent further encroachment by communism.
c.	Gradual reduction and eventual elimination of the preponderant power and influence’of the USSR in Asia to such. & degree that the SoViet Union will not be capable of threatening from that area the security of the United States or its
'	. friends and that the SoViet Union would encounter serious ob-
; stacles should it attempt to threaten the peace, national independence and stability of the Asiatic nations.
d.	PreVention of power relationships in Asia Which would enable any other nation or alliance to threaten the security of the United States from that area, or the peace, national independence and stability of the Asiatic nations,
2.	In pursuit of these objectives, the United States should act to: •	•	.
a.	Support non-Communist forces in taking the initiative in Asia;
b.	Exert an influence to adVance its own national interests; and
c.	Initiate action in such a manner as will appeal to the Asiatic nations as being compatible with their national interests and Worthy of their support.
For the purposes of this report "Asia" is defined as that part the continent of Asia south of the USSR and east of Iran together '*hth the major off-shore isla.nds--Japan, Formosa, the Philippines, . Indonesia and Ceylon.

a.	The United States should make known its sympathy With the efforts of Asian leaders to form regional associations of non-Communist states of the various Asian areas, and if in due course associations eventuate, the United States should be prepared, if invited, to assist such associations to fulfill their purposes under conditions Which would be to our interest. The follOWing principles should guide our actions in this respect:
(1)	Any association formed must be the result of a genuine desire on the part of the participating nations to cooperate for mutual benefit in solving the political, economic, social and cultural problems of the area.
(2)	The United States must not take such an actiVe part in the early stages of the formation of such an association that it Will be subject to the charge of using the Asiatic nations to further United States ambitions.
(3)	The association, if it is to be a constructive force, must operate on the basis of mutual aid and self-
help in all fields so that a true partnership may based on equal rights and equal obligations.

(4)	United States participation in any stage development of such an association should be with to accomplishing our basic objectives in Asia and
of the a VieW to as-
suring that any association formed Will be in accord with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations dealing With regional arrangements.
b.	The United States should act to develop'and strengthen the security of the area from Communist external aggression or internal subversion. These steps should take into account any benefits to the. security of Asia Which may flow from the deVelopment of one or more regional groupings. The United States on its ovn initiatiVe should now:
(1)	Improve the United States position With respect to Japan, the Ryukyus and the Philippines.
(2)	Scrutinize closely the development of threats from Communist aggression, direct or indirect, and be pre pared to-help within our means to meet such threats by providing political, economic, and military assistance and adVice Where clearly needed to supplement the resistance of the other governments in and out of the area Which are more directly concerned.

United States should be adapted to promote, Where possible, economic conditions that Will contribute to political stability in friendly countries of Asia, but the United States should carefully avoid assuming responsibility for the economic Welfare and deVelopment of that continent.
