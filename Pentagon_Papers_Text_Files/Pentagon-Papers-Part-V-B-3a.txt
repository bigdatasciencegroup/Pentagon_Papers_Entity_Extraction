7.	Dulles outlines U.S. policy on Indochina to Bidault. The
U.S.: (1) is fully aware of the importance of the French struggle; (2) sees the situation with "real sense of urgency" ;(3) shares concern regarding "adequacy of the financial contribution" by Indochinese ano. French residents there; (4) desires agreement that Viet Minh defeat would deter CHICOM intervention; and (5) appreciates French views on participation by Associated States in discussing policy and receiving U.S. military and economic aid. Dulles 4907 to Paris, 19 March 1953.......................................   15
8.	President Eisenhower stresses the importance of EDC as a means for European viability to Mayer and LeTourneau. The "President declared that EDC is so important in American eyes that the American people would not support aid to France if they were given the impression that France is resorting to dilatory tactics in order to postpone ratification...." Dulles 4992 to Paris, 26 March 1953..................... 17
9.	Secretary Dulles reassures the French that a "Chinese Communist attack is unlikely" in Indochina and that any Korean armistice would have "automatically failed fitzj purpose." Dulles 5001 to Paris, 27 March 1953....................... 19
10.	The French plan to create "strong free states, in Indochina" is to be studied even though Eisenhower feels that the timetable is too slow. The U. S. is intent on doing nothing to increase France's difficulties. Dulles 5040 to Paris, 30 March 1953........................................................ 21
11.

placing responsibility on the Vietnamese, and the plan
relies extensively on small unit operations. See also documents numbered 35, 36 and 37, below. JCS memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 April 1953......................-	24

14.	The U. S. urges the French to come forward with a program which can sensibly be sold to Congress as holding promise of a satisfactory outcome, "perhaps in a couple of years." Dulles indicates that the President would favor as much as $525 million and possibly more this year if Congress could be told "this program has enough chance of success ..../that/ it will largely-clear up the situation." Bi-Partite US-French Conversations, 22 April 1953.................. 27
15.	The JCS at a meeting with State informally indicates reservations on the feasibility of the French plan. The JCS feel that the French must appoint an "aggressive French military leader" to Indochina, revise the strategy toward more offensive action, and use Vietnamese forces in large rather than small units — otherwise "U.S. aid would be wasted" in Indochina. State TOSEC 9 to Paris, 24 April 1953...................................................... 31
16.	The U. S. position is clearly that "armies released in Korea" will not strike elsewhere. Since the Indochina war does not have the "status of an international war," the U. S. suggests that perhaps the French should bring the current Laos problem before the Security Council. Extract of Tripartite US-UK-French Meeting, 25 April 1953-••.	32
17.	France is told that the U. S. proposes to recommend an FY 1954 Mutual Security Program (MSP) for France of $100 million for equipment of French units in SACEUR, $460 million in funds as 40)$ of Indochina war expenditure rate, and an additional unspecified amount involving trained Associated States forces. Memorandum on Aid, Paris 5673 to Secretary of State, 26 April 1953.................... 34
18.	The French are reluctant to bring the Laos aggression
.	before the Security Council because it "might precipitate
a colonial debate." Dulles Memorandum of Conversation, 27 April 1953.................................................. 37
19.	The French request for C-119 aircraft reaches Eisenhower and raises the question of sending U. S. personnel on combat missions in Indochina. Such a decision is seen as having "repercussions" and raising many problems.
Douglas MacArthur, II, memorandum, 27 Ap'il 1953............... 08
20.	The JCS approves the loan of six C-119 aircraft to the
French for use in Indochina provided they are flown by civilian pilots. The CIA is to complete the transactions.

21 May 1953.................................................... 42

"think in terms of the ’Navarre Concept’ in association with the war in Indochina." O'Daniel Report to JCS, 14 July 1953-............................................... 69
28.	The U. S. expresses gratification at announced French political plans and indicates that the Navarre Plan "had impressed us favorably."

37.	The JCS position is changed from 11 August to include "the basic requirement for military success in Indochina" as one of creating a political climate to provide incentive for the natives to support the French and supply them with intelligence. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in considering the Navarre Concept, continue to believe that . additional U.S. support should be conditioned on continued French support, demonstration of French performance, and acceptance of U.S. military advice.

•
57« The JCS express concern over developments in the status of the MAAG Chief to Indochina relative to a considerable increase in personnel and scope of training responsibilities. The French feel that "it should be clearly understood that neither O'Daniel nor MAAG was to have any powers, advisory or otherwise" in planning operations or training the national armies. The JCS feels a demotion of O’Daniel in deference to Navarre is detrimental to U. S. prestige. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 5 March 1954........................................................ 264

62.	Admiral Radford shares doubts of other JCS members on the adequacy of measures taken by General Navarre at Dien Bien Phu. General Ely predicts the outcome at Dien Bien Phu as "50-50" ana emphasizes the great political importance of the battle. Radford is "gravely fearful" that French measures will be* inadequate, the consequences could lead . to loss of Southeast Asia, and to avoid this, the U. S. must be "prepared to act promptly and in force" to a belated French request for intervention. See Annex B to Document 63, page 277. JCS Memorandum for the President, 24 March 1954 ...................................................... 288
63.	General Ely, Chairman of the French Chiefs of Staff, is "unsympathetic" to the JCS view to expand MAAG, Indochina to assist in training Vietnamese. Ely feels it would	.

64.	The U. S. reiterates to the U. K. the following assumed position: (1) that Britain supports our agreement to discuss Indochina at Geneva provided France would not turn over the area to the Communists; and (2) "we shall not, however, be disposed to give Communist China what it wants from us merely to buy its promises of future good behavior." Dulles 5090 to London, 1 April 1954................. 291
65.	The U. S. proposes a coalition of U. S., France, Associated States, U. K., Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines, which would fight' in Indochina as an alternative to French Union surrender and as a position of strength going to Geneva. Dulles 3476 to Paris, 3 April. 1954.....................................................   293
66.	The British consider partition the "least undesirable settlement" for Indochina and had not developed thoughts on a confrontation with a French sell-out. Dulles 5177 to London, 4 April 1954............................*................ 295

68.	NSC Action No. 1O74-A considers the problem of determining the circumstances, conditions, and extent to which the U.S. should commit its resources to save Indochina. The problem involves four issues: (1) the prospect of loss of Indochina; (2) the risks, requirements, and consequences of intervention;. (3) desirability and form of U. S. intervention; and (4) the timing and circumstances of intervention. NSC Action 1O74-A, 5 April 1954............................ 298
69.	The U. S. Army position on intervention in Indochina cites the military disadvantages of such action. Specifically, the Army views are that air and naval forces alone cannot assure victory; that atomic weapons do not reduce the number of ground troops required; that at least seven U. S. divisions with air and naval support are required to win if the French withdraw and the Chinese do not intervene; and that the equivalent of twelve U. S. divisions are required if the Chinese intervene. Army Position on NSC Action No. 1O74-A (undated)......................................... 332
70.	The President's Special Committee studies the problem to secure the defeat of Communism and establish a "Western oriented complex" in Southeast Asia without resort to overt combat operations by U. S. forces. The report recommends implementation of courses of action previously *	recommended by the JCS (i.e., augment the French Air
Force, assign CIA officials to Indochina, and allocate additional funds to Indochina); and that selective political, military, and psychological steps be taken as a matter of priority (i.e., expand MAAG, expand use of U.S. .	covert assets in unconventional warfare field, develop
foreign information campaign, etc.). Part I, "Indochina" to the President’s Special Committee Report on Southeast Asia (undated)................................................. 333
71.	The President's Special Committee submits recommendations concerning longer range policy and courses of action for possible future contingencies ir. Southeast Asia not covered by NSC 5405. It is recommended that the U. S. accept nothing short of military victory, oppose a negotiated settlement at Geneva, pressure the Associated States to continue the war with U. S. support even if .	negotiations succeed, and seek participation of other
nations. Regardless of the outcome of current operations in Indochina, the U. S. in all prudence should develop a regional defense posture incorporating all the Southeast Asian states. Part II, Special Committee Report on Southeast Asia, 5 April 1954................................... 346

76.	Dulles emphasizes that unless a new element is interjected	•
into Indochina situation, such as an ad hoc coalition of nations prepared to fight, the French will "sell-out" at Geneva. The U. K., Australia, and New Zealand attitude is the key to "united action" and it is believed that Red China would not intervene. Dulles 163 to Canberra,

77-	The Maloney mission, which reviewed the Indochina cost study with the U. S. Country Team in Saigon, concludes that "it is not possible...to arrive at any reasonable estimate of cost" to the U. S. of materials for the Indochina war. The "crash requirements" and the French impression (from visiting U. S. officials) that all requests will be granted has kept the MDAP program in a "constant state of flux."

79-	It is noted by the NSC Planning Board that France has had the loan of U. S. carrier "Belleau wood" for nearly a year without use in the Indochina war. Further, the French' "urgent requests" for U. S. aircraft appear contradictory in light of the sale of "Ouragon" jets to India and use of the "Belleau wood" as a "delivery wagon." General Bonesteel Memorandum for Robert Cutler, Presidential Assistant,

80.	In view of the NSC actions on 6 April (192d Meeting)and subsequent Presidential approval, the Secretary of Defense directs the JCS to "promptly prepare the military plans" for the contingency of intervention at Dien Bien Phu. He also notes that the Presidential directed the State Department to concentrate its- efforts prior to Geneva on organizing a regional grouping for the defense of Southeast Asia. Secretary of Defense Memorandum to the Secretaries and JCS, 15 April 1954....................................................... 382
81.	The Department of Defense indicates concern over the lack of U. S. policy and pressures the State Department to come up with a U. S. position for the Indochina phase of . the Geneva Conference. The Defense version of a draft position recommends a positive and definite stance that U. S. objectives in Southeast Asia not be compromised and that if France does not accept this position the U. S. should not participate at Geneva. Defense Foreign Military Affairs Letter to U. Alexis Johnson, Coordinator of U. S. Delegation to Geneva, 15 April 1954........................... 384

84.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff reject a French proposal for additional aid because of the major military consequences of involving U.

85-	Dulles and Eden exchange frank and heated words over the British pressuring France for a cease-fire. The U. S. indicates that the tripartite position is poor, i.e., not "very impressive or cohesive" and that "the other side" was worried — but not about Britain. The U. S. is also concerned over the affects on NATO, EDC and the entire defense structure in Europe. DULTE 13, 27 April 1954................................................................ 395
86.	Dulles makes an estimate of rapidly moving developments: (1) when Dien Bien Phu falls, the French Government will change, probably to the left, committed to liquidate China. A withdrawal of forces to defensible enclaves under U.S. protection with subsequent U.S. training of native armies is considered. Open intervention at this point would be answered by Chinese intervention, (2) U.K. attitude is one of increasing weakness, (3) "the decline of France, the great weakness of Italy, and the considerable weakness of England create a situation where...we must be prepared to take the leadership...." DULTE 21, 29 April 1954....................................................... 397
87.	In the event of a cease-fire in Indochina, the JCS recommend that shipment of U. S. military aid under MDAP be immediately suspended and the entire program of aid to Indochina be re-examined. JCS Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, 30 April 1954......................... 399
88.	The Intelligence Advisory Committee concludes that the fall of Dien Bien Phu would have far-reaching and adverse repercussions, but would not signal the collapse of the French Union political and military situation in Indochina, nor would it substantially alter relative military capabilities of French end Viet Minh forces. The French Union could retain control of the cities though there would be a serious decline in the Vietnamese will to continue the war. NIE 63-54, 30 April 195k................................................................ 400
89.	Major General Thomas J. H. Trapnell, former Chief of MAAG, Indochina comments in his debriefing on the French situation in Indochina. His comments cover in detail the strategic position of Indochina., the government and its prosecution of the war, the performance of MDAP supported forces, the objectives of the opposing forces, the organization and tactics of both the French and Viet Minh forces. In Trapnell‘s view, few of the aims of the Navarre concept are progressing satisfactorily. "Dien Bien Phu is not only another.Na San, but a grave

tactical and strategic error." On the political aspects of the war, Trapnell feels that "a strictly military
.	solution to the war in Indochina is not possible...It is •
doubtful if the ordinary people understand the issues at stake between the rebel and Associated Suates objectives." The solution in Indochina requires a strong French assault on the Viet Minh*, training of National armies, a defensive alliance of Asian nations, and a guarantee of the Associated States borders. Trapnell recommends a U.S. training mission for Indochina, and concludes that victory in Indochina is international rather than local and essentially political as well as military. Major General Trapnell Debriefing, 3 May 1954..................................................... 406
90.	Indochina is the only nation that has the highest MDAP priority and thus has precedence over every other nation for allocation of critical military equipment. The JCS have completed a plan for military intervention in Indochina and, as well, planned for resumption of hostilities in Korea. CINCPAC has directed that other plans be prepared, i.e., blockade of China coast, evacuation of French forces from Tonkin, etc. Joint Subsidiary Plans Memorandum for OCB, 5 May 1954............................... 421
91.	General Smith reviews the French proposal which has been «.	sent to the Cabinet for approval. France proposes a
cease-fire take place when "international" control machinery, based on Laniel's 5 March conditions, is in	.
place. Regular troops would be regrouped into delimited areas and all other forces disarmed. France assumes that the Russians would propose a follow-on political settlement (coalition) and immediate elections. SECTO 106, 5 May 1954........................'............................ 423
92.	The NSC 195th Meeting considers Secretary Dulles pessimistic report on Geneva to the President: (1) there is no responsible French Government to deal with, (2) the British reject the "regional grouping," (3) the British want secret talks on Southeast Asia, (4) the expected communist proposal is for foreign troop withdrawal and elections, (5) and the U.K. wants a settlement based on partition. NSC 195th Meeting, 6 May 1954........................... 425
93.	Dulles briefs Congressional leaders on tne Geneva Con-fcrence and reviews the weaknesses of Britain’s position. Congress members comments are adverse. Dulles states three conclusions: (1) U.S. should not intervene mili--	tarily, (2) U.S. must push rapidly for a Southeast Asia
' community, (3) and the U.S. should not "write -off" the British and French in spite of their weakness in Asia. TEDUL 37, 6 May 1954............................................. 426

94.	The JCS forward their views on negotiations with respect to Indochina to the Secretary of Defense for transmittal to the Department of State in regard to SECTO 106. The JCS feel that, based on the Korean experience, and as a minimum, the U.S. should not "associate itself with any French proposal directed toward a cease-fire in advance of a satisfactory political settlement." JCS Memorandum to Secretary of Defense, 7 May 1954................................ 430
95* President Eisenhower makes it clear that the preconditions for U.S. intervention in Indochina are that the "U.S. would never intervene alone, that the indigenous people must invite intervention, and that there must be regional or collective action. The NSC action of the meeting on 5 April as pertains to paragraph.l.b. of the record (organizing a regional grouping) is approved by	.

96.	May 8 - July 21: Geneva Conference on Indochina. The 1st Plenary Session convenes on 8 May and hears proposals by France and the Viet Minh for cessation of hostilities and participation in the conference. (Excerpts) The delegates to the conference are from Great Britain and the USSR (joint chairmen), France, the United States, Communist China, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and the Viet Minh	_
regime. (Final agreements are signed on July 20 and 21, and the main provisions concerning Vietnam are that (1) Vietnam is to be partitioned along the 17th parallel into North and South Vietnam, (2) regulations are imposed on foreign military bases and personnel end on increased armaments, (3) countrywide elections, leading to the reunification of North and South Vietnam, are to be held by July 20, 1956, and (4) an International Control Ccm-	.
mission (ICC) is to be established to supervise the irn-plementation of the agreemcnts. The United States and Vietnam are not signatories to the agreements. The United States issues a unilateral declaration stating that it (1) "will refrain from the threat or the use of force to disturb" the Geneva agreements, (2) "would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the aforesaid agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security," and (3) , "shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections, supervised by the UN to insure that they are conducted fairly.")

97.	The Defense member of the NSC Planning Board indicates the options available to the U.S. with regard to the Geneva results. General Bonesteel suggests that the increased risks associated with pressuring France to continue the war and possible U.S. intervention to stop the communist advance can "more surely and safely be accepted , now than ever again." On the other hand, a compromise at Geneva would lead to communist subversion at a late date and U.S. involvement then might be inhibited by an increased Soviet nuclear capability. "Asia could thus be lost." General Bonesteel Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 9 May 1954................................................
98.	The draft instructions for the Geneva Delegation, which have been approved by the President are sent to the Defense Department for'comment. According to the instructions, the U.S. is "an interested nation which, however, is neither a belligerent nor a principal in the negotiation." State Department Letter to R. B. Anderson, Deputy Secretary of Defense, 10 May 1954................
99.	France is convinced it is facing Communist China at Dien Bien Phu not Viet Minh rebels. The French request the aid of competent U.S. military advice, i.e., a U.S. General to confer with General Ely on regrouping forces in Indochina. Paris 4287 to Dulles, 10 May 1954...................
100.	The United States "posture" at Geneva is interpreted as "to cheer the players" rather than "to pitch." The draft instructions to the Geneva delegation imply a "profound point" — will the U.S. admit diplomatic defeat and cease to use the conference toward its ends if the conference appears to go against the U.S.? General Bonesteel Memorandum for Deputy Secretary of Defense, 10 May 1954...............................................
101.	The President approves informing the French of his conditions for U.S. intervention in Indochina. Even though premature, the decision to internationalize the war must be made. President Eisenhower would ask Congressional authority to commit U.S. forces provided: (1) there was a. French request, (2) that other nations would be requested and would accept, (3) that the UI would be notified, (4) that France guarantees independence in the French Union to the Associated States, including the option to withdraw at any time, (5) that France would not withdraw its forces after the intervention, and (6) that an agreed on structure for united action is reached.

102.	The President approves NSC Action No. 1111 recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff which immediately suspends "shipment of military end-items under U.S. MDAP" to Indochina. NSC Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 11 May 1954..............................................  456
103.	Secretary Dulles forwards the basic instructions approved by the President for the head of the U.S. Delegation to Geneva. "The United States is not prepared to give its express or implied approval to any cease-fire, armistice, or other settlement...." which would subvert the local governments, impair territorial integrity, or jeopardize forces of the French Union. Dulles TOSEC 138 to Geneva, 12 May 1954................... 457
104.	A proposal tabled at the Planning Board meeting on	.
13 May 1954, suggests that "the U.S. is endeavoring to avoid the loss of Indochina and to resolve the colonialism problem by the creation of a regional grouping." General Bonesteel Memorandum to NSC, 13 May 1954.......................................... 460
105.	Laniel and Schuman appear well pleased with the U.S. position, especially that U.K. participation is no longer a prerequisite to U.S. intervention. The one “	serious objection to Eisenhower's conditions, however,
is that "France publicly accord to the Associated States the right of withdrawal from the French Union at any time." Unless some way can be found around this, "the French will never ask for outside assistance." Paris 4383 to Dulles, 14 May 1954............ 462
106.	In referring to the French objection to Eisenhower’s conditions for intervention, Dulles indicates the U.S. might be flexible but "there cannot be any equivocation on the completeness of independence if we are to get the Philippines and Thailand to associate themselves." without them the whole arrangement would collapse and the U.S. is not prepared to intervene "as part of a white western coalition ■which is shunned by all Asian states." Dulles 4094 (TEDUL 73) to Paris, 15 May 1954.......	465
107.	The "right’of withdrawal" from the French Union is unacceptable to France because it reflects on French honor and questions the concept of the French Union. It is proposed that existence of a powerful Vietnamese National Army would clarify the independence status to	<
other Asian states and therefore the U.S. should assume "primary responsibility for the training and equipping of a. Vietnamese National Army." Dillon 4402 to Dulles, 17 May 1954............'.....'....................... 469

108.	The present acute crisis prevents successful debate on the European Defense Community (EDC) proposal in the • French Parliament.

1C9. Secretary Stevens emphasizes the Army’s concern over high-level official views that "air and sea forces alone could solve our problems in Indochina" and that the complex nature of these problems would require a major logistical effort — "it explodes the myth that air and sea forces could solve the Indochina problems."

111.	The JCS recommend against a "Korea-type" defense of Southeast Asia as unsound. Accordingly, the U.S. "should adopt the concept of offensive actions *	against the 'military power of the aggressor,’ (in
this instance, Communist China) rather than local reaction to the attack. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 May 1954........................................ 480
112.	General Smith cannot understand why the JCS downgraded U.S. military representation on the five-power staff conference because the Russians and Chinese must have known "we really intended serious business." DULTE 100, 23 May 1954................................... 483
113.	The U.S. feels,as a minimum, France and Vietnam should sign draft Treaty of Independence, France should indicate "equal and sovereign" status of French Union states, and declare withdrawal of French Expeditionary Forces as soon as possible.

114.	The JCS point out their belief that, from the U.S. point
t of view with reference to the Far East,"Indochina is devoid of decisive military objectives and allocation of more than token U.S. aimed forces in Indochina would be a serious diversion of limited U.S. capabilities."

115* The white House views the JCS position on intervention in Indochina as not involving any new policy issue relative to NSC 5405- However, a pencilled Secretary of Defense marginal note indicates that the white House "misses the point" — the JCS was considering the "regional grouping" and others in the grouping, i.e., . U.K. may object to NSC 5405 policy. Hence the JCS is warning "not to get involved in such a grouping" unless all parties accept direct action. white House Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 26 May 1954........................ 494
116.	Ely emphasizes particular points to Trapnell and Dillon: (1) Ely was not in accord with O'Daniel's proposal to reorganize the Vietnamese army on a divisional basis, (2) O'Daniel’s operational war plan was unrealistic, (3) the increasing frequency of American criticism of French conduct of the war was not appreciated, (4) Ely was regrouping his forces for defense of the Delta, and (5) one or two U.S. Marine divisions could assure defense of the Delta. Paris 4566 to Dulles, 27 May 1954.....	495
117.	The U.S. Delegation to Geneva clearly sees a forthcoming settlement which the U.S., under NSC, cannot associate itself with. Both the dangers of partition and impossibility of armistice supervision in Indochina are recognized. "There is very little that the Defense Department can do to influence the negotiations, since a	.
political decision has been made that the U.S. will continue to participate" even though partition will ultimately result in loss of Indochina to communism.

121.	There is no misunderstanding between U.S. and France if U.S. policy on a Chinese intervention would be "judged under the circumstances of the moment." Dillon cites three courses of action open to the U.S. in such an event: (1) President will request Congress to act, (2) President would request authority to use forces, or (3) U.S. would act only as part of a collective action.
. Paris 4625 to Dulles, 1 June 1954............................... 508
122.	NSC Action 5421 incloses summaries of studies prepared by various departments and agencies with respect to "possible U.S. action regarding Indochina." Summaries included here are of studies prepared by Departments of State, Justice, Defense and CIA, Office of Defense Mobilisation, Bureau of the Budget, Foreign Operations Administration and Operations Coordinating Board.
NSC 5421, 1 June 1954.......................................... 510
123.	Disagreement exists that the U.S. and France have "now reached accord in principal on the political side" on conditions for U.S. participation in Indochina. The U.S. needs a precise statement of France's commitments to meet the preconditions for intervention. Dulles 4421 to Paris, 4 June 1954................................................ 530
»	124. Saigon suggests that in order to make a French declara-
tion more palatable, the U.S. announce its intention to withdraw technical and military assistance as soon as practicable. In "neutralist Asian eyes, the U.S. is the principal threat to Eastern Asia....and not decadent France." A review of terms of reference which limit MAAG to a logistical function is now essential. Saigon 2656 to Dulles, 4 June 1954............................................ 531
125.	The U.S. seeks to avoid formal identification with open partition or the creation of two states. While U.S. military authorities take a "gloomy view" of the military situation, France has failed to decide to "internationalize" the war on the conditions laid down in Paris. The French are not treating the U.S. proposal •	seriously but "toying with it just enough to use it as
a talking point at Geneva." TEDUL 169, 7 June 1954............. 533
126.	General Valluy evaluates the Tonkin Delta military situation: (1) If Tonkin is lost, a military line will not be re-established, (2) in this connection, there are no South Vietnamese who could oppose North Vietnamese, (3) Ho Chi Minh's objective is Tonkin and the political capital Hanoi, to be gained either by (

127.	Dulles feels that it is of "overriding importance" to push on with action on Thailand's appeal to the United Nations Security Council, TOSEC 368, 7 June 1954..................... 538
12Q. The U.S. will seek firm views of others once the "French authoritively tell us they want to internationalize the Indochina war." Further, when France decides to request U.S. intervention, the U.S. must have the opportunity to make its own decision based on prevailing circumstances, "we cannot grant the French an indefinite option on us without regard to intervening deterioration." TEDUL 175, 8 June 1954..........................*............................... 540
129.	Because of Thailand's strong feeling the scope of appeal	.
should not be limited to Thailand. The Thai government has a negative attitude on limiting the scope and they object to Czechoslovakia or other Soviet satellite membership on the Peace Observation Commission (POC).
United Nations 810 to Dulles, 8 June 1954...................... 542
130.	Bidault replies to a conversation reported in DULTE 156 (not printed here) in which "agreement in principle" with the U.S. had been reached. No major differences are noted, however, French military believe any JCS war plan would show the necessity of at least one Marine division for the Delta. General Valluy's conversations at the Pentagon are seen as most crucial. "Thus if we want

vital...JCS...approve a joint war plan justifying the use of Marines." Paris 4766 to Dulles, 9 June 1954............. 544

133.	"General Ely has*twice in my presence stated that his keenest desire is for the United States to enter this war." The purpose of General Valluy's statement (war assessment) is either to bring the U.S. and five other powers into the conflict or to prepare an "excuse before history" for an armistice. Saigon 2714 to Dulles, 10 June 1954........................................................ 552
134.	The French military feel that a Tonkin decision will rest on U.S. intentions. The French are reluctant to request "internationalization" which would result in new talks and provoke new "hopes." The U.S., on the other hand, does not want to consider a U.S. training mission separate from the "overall operational plan" on the assumption the conditions are fulfilled for U.S. participation in Indochina. Murphy (Acting SecState) 4508 to Paris, 10 June 1954..............................................................   553
135.	The French impression is that even after all conditions are met, the chances of U.S. participation are "nil." with this attitude it is only a matter of time until the French come to terms with the Viet Minh. The result would be disastrous to French public opinion and the "U.S. would be blamed" for having failed in the crisis. Therefore, it is recommended that the French be informed that "the President is no longer prepared to request military intervention" even if France fulfills all conditions. France should strive for an armistice and thus avoid a military disaster. A few months delay in coramu-nist takeover in Indochina is not commensurate with "possible collapse of the defense of Western Europe." Paris 4841 to Dulles, 14 June 1954.................................. 555
136.	The French want, and "in effect have, an option on our intervention, but they do not want to exercise it and .	the date of expiry of our option is fast running out."
TEDUL 197, 14 June 1954........................................ 558
137.	Secretary Dulles emphasizes that events have shown that
• predictions he has made all along on the lack of any real French desire for U.S. intervention but "as a card to play at Geneva." The U.S. does not see that France's bitterness is justified considering "prolonged- French and U.K. indecision." Dulles 4579 to Paris, 14 June 1954....	559

154.	The U.S. does not want to be associated with a settlement which falls short of the seven-point memorandum on which . Britain agreed and now appear to be less than firm, "if either or both the French and Communists are operating on the assumption we will adhere to any settlement they agree to, then we may be headed for serious trouble."
Dulles 52 to Paris, 3 July 1954................................ 603
155-	Dillon recommends that if the U.S. attempts to get the best possible settlement, we should (1) maintain a Geneva delegation, (2) have Dulles return to head the delegation, (3) offer French support to sell a settlement to Vietnam if it is satisfactory, and (4) pressure Britain to stick to the seven points of US-UK agreement. Paris 41 to Dulles, 4 July 1954............................................... 606
156.	The French welcome the US-UK 7-point agreement except that clarification was suggested on the conflict between provisions for elections and the position that no political provisions should risk loss of the area to communism.

Both State and Defense were notified via Trapnell's hand-carried plans and diplomatic cables.

165.	President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles indicate firmly to President Mendes-France the rationale behind not sending Dulles or General Smith back to Geneva. Essentially, the rationale is based on failure of the U.S., U.K. and France to agree on a joint position at Geneva and lack of agreement on a "united action" proposal if the position is not accepted by the communists. Dulles sees France and U.K. enhancing a communist "whittling-away" proce'ss by readily accepting less than the seven points. Dulles 127 to Paris, 10 July 1954............................

Views of the U.K. on collective security of Southeast Asia are summarized: (1) the British prefer a generalized collective arrangement with as many states involved as possible; (2) the preferred organization would have a general council, a political/economic council, and a military organization; (3) in the event of no Indochina agreement, the British would move ahead with a military arrangement to meet the threat. Admiral Davis Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 13 July 1954.......................... 635

170-	Secretary Dulles reports on his trip to Paris at the NSC meeting. Dulles had told Mendes that France's troubles stemmed from lack of a decision on EDC and the Soviets were successful in splitting France and Germany. If the U.S. cannot guarantee the Geneva Conference results or influence France to reject any settlement, the U.S. will be blamed and put a major strain on Franco-United States relations.

173.	The Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference secretly passes the U.S. delegate a note of protest which had been handed to the French. The note complains that the "National Government of Vietnam has been left in complete ignorance" of proposals made by the French to other nations on Vietnam’s fate. Vietnam rejects the de facto partition proposal, a cease-fire, and requests that United Nations control be established over all
Vietnam territory. SECTO 633, 17 July 1954..................... 651
174.	The Chinese Communists inform the U.S. of their position via Seymour Topping, Associated Press. The despatch reflects the views of Chou En-lai and demands that the U.S. guarantee a "partition peace plan."

185.	The State Department explains the rationale of why the United States issued a unilateral declaration instead of signing the 1954 Accords on Indochina. Secretary Dulles was unwilling to even consider signing accords
on Indochina of the type concluded at Geneva, and hence
was not an alternative to issuing a unilateral declara-
' tion but was a substitute suggested by the French leaders. The declaration was based on the understandings of the 14 July Franco-American Six Point position paper.

188.	The CIA assesses the probable outlook in Indochina in the light of agreements at the Geneva Conference. The conclusions are:(1)that the communists will continue to
pursue their objectives in South Vietnam by political, psychological and paramilitary means; (2) that if elections are held in 1956, the Viet Minh will win;
(3)	and that the events in Laos and Cambodia depend on the developments in Vietnam. National Intelligence

The French view of Diem Government is that it does not qualify on three major points: (1) fully representative

192.	The French have been lead to believe that Dulles made an offer of the use of atomic bombs at Dien Bien Phu and that Bidault was "much upset" by the offer and felt that they would have done no good tactically.

194.	On the offer of atomic bombs, the French agree that there has been a complete misunderstanding, possibly based on language difficulties.

207.	The JCS see the Geneva cease-fire agreement as a major obstacle to the introduction of adequate U.S. MAAG personnel and of additional arms and equipment.

216.	The State Department’s estimate of the political situation is that Hinh holds a veto power over Diem; "jockeying for power and struggle for cabinet positions is resulting ir. paralyzing impasse"; French reference to "another structure of government" implies a "hankering to reestablish a. political system" which might involve direct colonial-type controls by France; and, unless Diem receives U.S.-French support, his chances of success appear slight. Paris TEDUL 11 NIACT, 21 October 1954............................................................ 780
217.	This message contains the policy of the U.S. Government and instructions to the Ambassador and Chief of MAAG in Saigon necessary to carry out the provisions of NSC 5429/2 pertaining to training of Vietnamese armed forces.
Draft Joint State-Defense Message, 21 October 1954............ 7&3
218.	The OCB draft recommendations on training in Vietnam outline the U.S. role in assisting the reorganization and training of the Vietnamese armed forces and specifies the coordination required between the Ambassador and Chief, MAAG. The question of ultimate size of the Vietnamese forces and U.S. support is left for "later determination." NSC 218th Meeting, 22 October 1954............................................................ 789
219.	The Report of the Van Fleet Mission to the Far East is discussed with President Eisenhower. General Van Fleet’s views are "somewhat different from present policies." As Van Fleet states the problem: "The problem before us is the failure of U.S. leadership in the Far East....the future will reveal other prices we must pay for the free world defeat in Indochina." White House Memorandum for General Bonesteel, 25 October 1954................................. "(02
220.	Diem is insisting on getting rid of General Hinh.
■ Eisenhower’s letter to Diem is being interpreted as superseding Washington agreements, that Diem has "full rein" without meeting the precondition of "forming a strong and stable government." The President’s letter can also be exploited by the Viet Minh and is ct.using the French concern. State Memorandum of Conversation, 26 October 1954................................................. 798
221.	Secretary Dulles forwards the main points of General Collins’ recommendations regarding force levels in Vietnam. In summary, the points are: (1) it would be disastrous if the French Expeditionary Corns (FEC) were withdrawn prematurely; (2) the U.S. should continue to subsidize the FEC; (3) the Vietnamese Army should be

(4)	the U.S. should assume training responsibility by . 1 January 1955; and (5) the French are agreeable to a slow build-up of MAAG. Dulles Memorandum for the President,
17 November 1954.............................................. 800
•
222.	The French Ambassador is informed by the FOA that, subject to agreement, the U.S. contemplates $100 million support for the FEC in Indochina for CY 1955• The Defense Department has "never agreed to the original position paper," which is based on General Collins’ recommendations, without details of his calculations. ISA Memorandum for Record, 24 November 1954.......................... 802
223.	Senator Mansfield states his conclusions based on
General Collins' analysis of the Vietnam situation: (1) prospects for Diem "look very dim," elections in 1956 would probably favor the communists; (2) the U.S. should continue to support Vietnam as long as possible; (3) he sees no alternative to Diem; (4) he is certain refugees, Catholic bishops and church officials would oppose replacement of Diem; (5) Paris should urge Bao Dai cease his interference and support Diem; (6) and Diem should be encouraged to compromise on issues.
State Memorandum of Conversation, 7 December 1954............. 806
224.	The French Government is considering the decision to accelerate withdrawal of the FEC and evacuation of civilians as a direct result of the U.S. decision to provide only one-third the amount requested for maintenance of the FEC in 1955. Paris 2448 to Dulles, 9 December 1954...................................................... 809
225.	Diem "passes the buck" of convincing the sect leaders not to oppose the appointment of Dr. Quat as Defense Minister to the U.S. Collins is convinced that Diem and his brothers,Luyen and Nhu, are afraid of Quat or any strong man in control of the armed forces since with "spineless General Ty" as Chief of Staff, Diem has effectively seized control of the army. Further, Collins comments on the alternatives to Diem Government; though the alternative of gradual withdrawal from Vietnam "is least desirable, in all honesty, and in view of what I have observed here to date it is
. possible this may be the only sound solution." Collins (Saigon) 2250 to Dulles, 13 December 1954.......................   811

Bien Phu ($1.2 million) which included 8 tanks, 24 howitzers, and 15,000 small arms. Defense Letter to Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 14 December 1954. 818
227.	Collins is convinced that "Diem does not have the capacity to unify divided factions in Vietnam" and unless decisive action or dramatic leadership gal' vanizes the country into unified action "this country will be lost to communism. "Apparently, the only Vietnamese who might be competent...is Bao Dai." It is recommended that the U.S. not assume responsibility for training on 1 January 1955, or give direct military aid. Collins 2303 for Dulles, 16 December 1954...................................................... 820
228.	Ambassador Heath suggests that General Collins’ recommendations ignore the basic factor that withholding aid from Diem would assist a communist takeover. Dulles has analyzed our situation in Vietnam as a "time buying operation" and Heath recommends continued support of Diem in spite of a "Bao Dai solution." The fear that $300 million plus our national prestige would be lost in a gamble" is a legitimate one, but withholding our support would "have a far worse effect." Heath Memorandum to FE, 17 December 1954........................ °24
229.	Tripartite discussions on Indochina are summarized.
To Secretary Dulles desire to continue strong support of Diem, Ely indicates that he and Collins have exerted pressure without result and "were now convinced that it was hopeless to expect anything of Diem." Ely feels that he and Collins must decide now "whether Diem was really the man capable of national union." Four points are agreed upon: (1) support Diem, (2) study alternatives, (3) investigate timing of replacement, and (4) (added by Dulles) how much more U.S. investment should be made in Indochina if it is decided there is no good alternative to Diem? Paris 2601 to State, 19 December 1954...................... 826
230.	The President approves NSC 5429/4 as amended and adopted by the Council as NSC 5R29/5. This statement on current U.S. policy in the Far East deals with the primary problem of the threat to U.S. security resulting from communist expansion in China, Korea, and North Vietnam.

that the Viet Minh can take over only by internal violence; (2) investment in Vietnam is justified even if only to buy time, we must be flexible and proceed carefully by stages; (3) "we have no choice but to continue our aid to Vietnam and support of Diem"; (4) Bao Dai’s return would not solve the problem; (5) revitalization of National army is hope for an improved security condition; (5) and "something should be done on our side" to exploit land reform issue. Dulles 2585 to Collins (Saigon), 24 December 1954.................................................
Collins refutes most of the comments of Ely and Mendes made at the tripartite discussion and is disturbed over some of the suggestions and attitudes of Mendes and Eden. He feels that he should be in washington in January if the NSC is to re-evaluate U.S. policy to avoid misunderstandings. Collins 2455 to Dulles, 25 December 1954................................................
Secretary Dulles decides that the U.S. should proceed as scheduled and "take the plunge" and begin direct aid to Vietnam on 1 January and move ahead on MAAG negotiations in Cambodia. Dulles feels that the JCS prerequisite on eliminating the French from Cambodia is "too legalistic and unrealistic."

234.	In light of the unstable situation in South Vietnam and conflicting views between General Collins and the State Department, Secretary wilson requests the JCS to "reconsider" U.S. military programs in Southeast Asia. Secretary of Defense Memorandum for JCS, 5 January 1955.............. 860
235.	- The JCS provide additional courses of action in Vietnam to the Secretary of Defense. Specifically, (1) to continue aid; (2) to unilaterally institute an "advisory system"; (3) if (1) and (2) fail, to deploy unilaterally or with SEATO; (4) or to withdraw all U.S. support from South Vietnam and "concentrate on saving the remainder of Southeast Asia." JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 January 1955............................................. 862
236.	General J. Lawton Collins reports on the situation in South Vietnam. The major factors which will affect the outcome of U.S. efforts are; (1) Viet Minh strength and intentions; (2) French attitude and intentions; (3) sects attitudes and intentions; (4) Vietnamese armed forces loyalties; (5) free Vietnam economy, and (6) Diem's popular support. There is no guarantee that Vietnam will remain free with U.S. aid — but without it, "Vietnam will surely be lost to communism." Memorandum for the National Security Council, 24 January 1955................... $64
237.	The Planning Board recommends approval of the Collins Report. NSC 234th Meeting, 27 January 1955........................... $^3
238.	The JCS recommend a concept and plans for the implementation, if necessary, of Article IV.1., of the Manila Pact (SEACDT). The primary objective is deterrence of "overt aggression by China or other Communist nations." The concept relies on development of indigenous forces and readiness to retaliate with U.S. power on the aggressor. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 11 February 1955..................................................... 885

241.	General Collins submits a seven step recommendation which centers on getting rid of Diem and reorganizing the government structure. Collins 4448 to Dulles, 9 April 1955.............. 894
242.	Diem exists by reason of U.S. support despite French reluctance. If the French view prevails, "removal of Diem... may well be interpreted in Vietnam and Asia as an example of U.S. paying lip service to nationalist cause, and then forsaking a true nationalist leader when 'colonial interests’ put enough pressure on us." Dulles 4438 to Saigon, 9 Apr 55.. 907
243.	Bao Dai recommends that the U.S. agree with the French to create a "Supreme Council" or "Council of Elders" to govern in place of Diem. The Birth Xuyen could have been used in the common effort if "Diem had not bungled matters." Bao Dai cannot rule for Diem by decree and considers Diem's strength as a "mockery." Paris 4396 to Dulles, 9 Apr 55............910
244.	Ely disagrees with the U.S. on maintaining Diem in office.
The worsening situation is attributed to Diem by the French and "only by surgery, that is rsnoval of Diem, can the country be saved." Ely feels that if Diem is . retaincd, he could not be the responsible French representative or remain in Saigon. Saigon 4661 to Dulles (Excerpts) 19 Apr 55........................................ 912
245.	Diem is seen as a barrier to forming an interim government and the .gap between him and other elements in the society is becoming wider. The U.S., however, warns Vietnamese leaders that if Diem is removed as a "sect victory" it would be "difficult to obtain popular support in the U.S. for continuation of U.S. aid." Saigon 4662 to Dulles, 20 Apr 55.............................................. 915
246.	Diem armounces to the U.S. his willingness to accept a coalition in the government but on his terms. This uncompromising attitude leads Collins to remark: "I see no alternative to the early replacement of Diem." Saigon 4663 to Dulles, 20 Apr 55......................................... 918
247.	Conclusions and recommendations are offered as a basis for future Department of Defense positions on the subject of South Vietnam. Key recommendations made are: to determine U.S. military action within the scope of SEACDT to prevent the loss of Southeast Asia as a result of the loss of South Vietnam, and to postpone indefinitely the elections proposed by Geneva Accords for Vietnam.

Diem until an alternative supported by Bao Dai is developed. Dulles 4757 to Saigon, 27 April 1955........................... 941
■
250.	The State Department is being forced to take a strong stand for Diem. Senator Mansfield is a strong backer of Diem and if Diem is forced out,there will be "real difficulties on the Hill." K.T. Young Memorandum for Robertson, 30 April 1955...............................................................   945
251.	Bao Dai registers strong complaints against U.S. support of Diem, U.S. inaction which allowed the present civil strife, and against U.S. failure to urge Diem to go to France. Diem, in Bao Dai’s opinion, is a "psychopath who wishes to martyrize himself." Paris 4y46 to Dulles, 30 April 1955................................................................. $48
252.	It is predicted that the success of Diem against the Binh Xuyen, Bao Dai, the French and General Vy has created a potentially revolutionary situation in Vietnam and, given U.S. support and French acquiescence, Diem is expected to stabilize the situation in Saigon. SNIE 63.1-2/1-55, 2 May 1955........................................................... 955
253-	Tripartite discussions again reveal basic disagreement.
The French conclude: "Diem is a bad choice...without him some solution might be possible but with him there is none...What would you say if we /France/ were to retire entirely from Indochina..." SECTO 8, H May 1955................ 959
254.	. The French are increasingly bitter toward Diem and convinced he must go. Steps are suggested to reconstitute a joint Franco-American approach to the situation. Among these are steps to reduce the French garrison in Saigon, replace Ely, and form a course of action after the crisis is over which persuades Diem to reorganize his government or else get rid of him. Saigon 5074 to Dulles, 8 May 1955........................................... 967
255-	The JCS reject both alternatives suggested by Dulles as solutions to the Vietnam problem. The JCS recommend that Dulles be advised that Diem shows the most promise for achieving internal stability, that the ' U.S. cannot guarantee security' of French nationals, and that U.S. actions under SEATO could possibly replace FEC presence.

JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 1 July 1955................................................
260.	In probable developments before July 1956, North
Vietnam (DRV), though confronted by serious economic problems, will consolidate its control north of the 17th parallel. The DRV army has increased in strength but will probably not attack Laos before mid-1956.
Tactics are likely to include activation of guerrilla units in South Vietnam and their reinforcement by infiltration from the North. NIE 63.1-55, 19 July 1955........ 993
261.	The consequences of selected U.S. courses of action are estimated in the event of Viet Minh aggression against South Vietnam. While overt aggression is unlikely, U.S. efforts at undertaking other steps to convince the Viet Minh that aggression will be met with intervention are expected to rcnder overt aggression even less likely. Failure to intervene • however, could signal an expanded Communist Chinese
effort in Asia. SNIE 63.1-4-55, 13 September 1955............  997

29^ An intelligence analysis of Communist capabilities and intentions in Laos concludes that the Communist resumption of guerrilla warfare in Laos is a reaction to initiatives of U.S. support of Laos. The chances of Communist success are high at a low risk. Non-Asian forces intervening in Laos increase the likelihood of Communist invasion, but preference would be to diplomacy, propaganda, and guerrilla action to cause the west to back down.

Dear General Collins:
It bcca.no increasingly svLipnt after ray arrival in Indo China and seeing the terrain, visiting the troops, and knowing tip typo cf comLi.t, that the most important a::d immediate need to the successful conclusion of thc war in Indo China was more troops. burin;. the past year, the Vietnamese Amy has be-n organized aS schedultd. Hcwcvcr, most of these units have been activated by merely transferring and renaming units in the Vietnamese Army which were already in being in the French Colonial Army. I am convinced that additional Vietnamese battalions, over and above the units approved- for support by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be activated.
In an informal conversation, the matter was discussed with General Salon who agreed to ths need but felt that the cost of many additional battalions and the cadre requirements were beyond the capacity of France to support, but that a realistic number should be sat up to be supported and trained. In order to have a clcar picture of the requirements, a study was made on the basis cf am additional forty (40) battalions.
In a short conference with Gencral Alessandri, Military Advisor to His	; ,
Majesty Bao Dai, he stated thst he recognised the inmindiate need for additional V Vietnamese troops, and ho cxplsined to ::r hir. concept for the organisation of /': additional battalions. These troops would be armed only with shoulder weapons, . light machine guns, and 60-MM mortars and wouli be trained in maneuvers over mountainous terrain, capable cf finding and destroying the enemy in his own	V
territory. Each battalion would be canned with a minimum of seven (?) French officers and thirty (30) Fr-n ch r.on-cc .missioned officers. French cadres would 2 Le furnished as far as possible from the Vietnamese battalions already in 1 cing, .' but which are at or- sent liinr employed on e static guard-duty basis, Military schools would be expanded in order to permit the battalions to be ready for a 1 combat assigiiment in Doccrtber 1' id.
This is m ambitious program, but	one which (if	implemented) will most	—
surely bril— this war to a quicker end. There is no	problem ».s to manpower	\
availability. The equipment required can be :ist by substitution of items already scheduled for nrogrtmmir- in tho	FY 1954 MDA Program; however, the big	N
problem is ths money necessary for the	pay, rations,	and individual equipment.	b
The trench stat- that this is beyond the fintmcid capacity of tho Victnsmcse Government cr France. T'—’.r -.stir.ate for th-.sc additional forty (-10) battx-lions is tv.clvs (12) billion fm cs fcr equipment and Seventy (70) billion francs a year fcr maintercnee. This figure is high in comparison with our estimate, because it includes the construction cost for schools and barracks, as well as pay, rations, ammunition, POL, ard clothing. The French staff is now drawing up plans for this proponed expansion.

The French Air Force in l"do China has been hampered by (1) a lnte delivery of .'.DAP programmed items and (P) a personnel ceiling imposed by Metropolitan Franco, which is well below t: =t required to do an cfficicnt job. The types and nu-bcr cf uircreft assigned arc, in i cmra.!, satisfactory for support of round actions. In the esse of airborne operations involving considerable number of troops, additional airlift and personnel must be brought in for temporary periods. Since greater emphasis has been placed upon this theatre and a high Supply priority established, the supply' picture has improved considerably in the past three (o) months and shows every indication of being completely relieved in another three to six mouths. The personnel shortage, however, will remain and will continue to adversely affect operations. Ths French have placed an arbitrary ceiling of 10,000 air-force personnel for FIG and wo believe this figure is about 5,000 short of that needed fcr efficient operations of the total number cf aircraft currently assigned ana employed. A conservative estimate indicates that the French Air Force could double its sortie rate with even a 33,t increase in personnel.
In addition to the military problem there arc political, economic, and social considerations which must be solved. A.n extensive psychological warfare ■	program can and must be implemented. Also the French must change their tactical
thinking from defcnsivo action to one of vigorous offense.
The Viet i'inh launched their winter offensive in Tonkin on 15 October 1952, taking the French by surprise not only as to time (three weeks earlier than anticipated), but also as to the direction and objective. The enemy has consequently retained tho initiative ever since. However, operation LORRAINE (combined airborne-ground maneuver), initiated by the French-Vietnamese forces on 10 November, successfully cut off the Viot Minh divisions fro:.: th.ir Chinese supply routes s.nd overrun substantial forward supply dumps. On 26 November, the French, withdraw their forces back into the perimeter in order to release scvero.l Groups Mobile for action to counteract Viet Minh infiltration in tho southern part of the Delta. Am convinced if t:.c French could have r-u aiued in the PHU DOAH area and extended their operation to YE" BAY, the Viot Minh reaction would of necessity hevc been to reverse the iirectior of their operations, engage the French in that area to clear their supply routes, with the result t'-mt a decisive action would have resulted under cor'U io s f-xorable to the Fronch-Vietnamese forces.
General de Linares is still hoping to make a trip to Koron, but both he and General Salon feol that i e should not leave at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
SUBJECT: Broadening the Participation of the United States in the Indochina Operation
In the memorandtmi of 14 November 1952 to the Secretary of Defense, concerning the Report of the Five Power Conference on Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised that, from a military viewpoint, it was desirable to aid the French to speed development of indigenous combat forces and to improve the supporting logistical and operating facilities.
F ’ W
Since an effective French-supported offensive in Indochina has failed to materialize and a continued stalemate is indicated, the Joint Secretaries have been requested, by memorandum, to consider United States support of a material augmentation of Vietnam Forces in Indochina. A copy of this memorandum is attached.
„	It is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff also undertake
a reexamination of United States participation in the Indochina operation, giving special consideration to training of indigenous forces and maintenance of United States supplied equipment by United States personnel.

In this general discussion of our foreign nolicy, I must make special mention of the var in Korea.
This trar is, for Americans, the 'iiont painful phase of Communist aggression throughout the vorid. It is clearly a part of the sane calculated assault that the aggressor is simultaneously pressing in Indochina and in Malaya, and of the strategic situation that manifestly embraces the island of Formosa and the Chinese Nationalist forces there. The Working ovt of any military solution to the Korean War trill inevitably affect all these areas.

Question of whether US could assist French in train- i ing of Vietnamese national leVies has been examined from I time to time. Conclusion reached generally negative be- J cause of language problem and also because of French sensitivities.
Nevertheless, it seems to us that French, Viets, ROKS i and ourselVeS could profit from exchange of experience in I this field.
I should therefore appreciate your view as to the / pOssibillty of arranging for exchange of missions between ' Korea and IC. Mission from IC could consist of French officers engaged in training national armies plus Viet, Cambodian and Laotian officer. Mission from Korea could consist of US officers plus one or more ROK officers. Idea would be that mission could examine training practices in other country with view to taking advantage useful features of experience in that country. Possibly after visits completed, two missions might have conference for purpose comparing nOtes and perhaps reaching certain conclusions or formulating recommendations.
If you think this idea presents possibilities, suggest you discuss it on informal and personal basis with Letourneau, Salan and perhaps Allard, and if they concur, vzith appropriate Vietnamese officials. Similarly, exploration will probably be conducted simultaneously with US and ROK officials in Korea.
VIe believe that carrying out of this exchange of •	'.

Foreign Minister Bidault stated that the French GoVernment considers there is one single problem to contend with, essentially the same in Europe, Africa, Asia and elsewhere, namely the problem occasioned by Soviet pressure. The basic element of French fOreign policy is tho determination to maintain and reinforce the operation of NATO as an expression of the commen will of the free world. He expressed his personal gratitude to the Secretary for the latter's statement on his arrival giving credit to France for their contribution to the common cause in Indochina.
Asia
Bidault reviewed the French contribution and manpower losses in Asia, recalled the erstwhile misunderstanding of the Indochina war as colonialist in nature, and expressed gratification at the present 'belated' recognition Of the conflict as part of the world-wide struggle. He made indirect reference to the deneutralisation of Fcrmosa: ’InitiatiVes on the entire Asiatic continent should in the French view be subject to joint discussions’ since any such initiatiVe could haVe immediate consequences for the French. China has no manpower problem, whereas France, Which must meet pressures in Europe, Africa, and Asia, is seuerely strained. He insisted that any US decisions bearing on China should be discussed With the French in view of their bearing on Indochina.
The Secretary said that President EisenhOwer also feels that Korea and Indochina are Darts of a single front, whfch was brought out in the State-of-the Union message. He is the first US President to recognize this publicly, and if the French government desires, vie would be prepared to discuss at a later date the possibility of action Which might make successful conclusion of the

At present, French, UK and US policies in that part of the world are not fully coordinated. (The Secretary then went inte a detailed exposition of the thoughts underlying the deneutralization of Formosa along the lines of the President 's message .)

Returning to the Indochina prOblem, Bidault obserVed with some asperity. 'I thank God and General Eisenhower that it took only six years to have France’s contribution there recognized fOT What it is.’ He politely suggested that the recall of the seventh Fleet constituted a matter for more than unilateral decisicn, since Chinese reaction could Very well come in Indochina.

Secondly, there would probably haVe to be political efforts to get natiVe Viet Nam support and cooperation.
Mr. Eden made two points: 1) He agreed that the French must have more troons and this moans that they must train more Vietnamese. Lord Alexander agreed, although he expressed some doubt whether, despite training, the Vietnamese would turn out to be as good fighters as the Koreans. 2) Mr. Eden said that he suspected that the financial burden is the basic problem for the French in Indochina.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Broadening the Participation of the United States in the Indochina Operation.

1.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff have re-examined the problems of United States participation in the Indochina operation as requested by your memorandum dated 19 January 1953, subject as above, and submit herewith their comments and recommendations.
2.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered broadening U.S. participation in the Indochina operation both from within and Without the framework of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP) with a view toward Speeding and improving the development of indigenous combat forces and supporting logistical and operating facilities. Special consideration has been’given, as requested by your office, to the training of indigenous forces and maintenance of U.S. supplied equipment by U.S. personnel.
3.	NSC 124/2 with regard to Indochina states in part that "...we should use our influence with France and Associated States to promote positive political, military, economic and social policies,” and "Continued recognition and carrying out by France of its primary responsibility for the defense of Indochina." NSC 124/2 also states that . . . "Our influence with the French and Associated States should be designed to further those constructiVe political, economic and social measavcs which will tend to increase the stability of the Associated States and thus make it possible for the French to reduce the degree of their participation in the military, economic and political affairs of the Associated States." In keeping with the foregoing policy, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that actions to broaden U.S. participation in Indochina would require scnsitiVe selection and application to aVoid any semblance of usurpation of French responsibilities and prerogatiVes. It is anticipated that any attempt by the United States to intrude in the French military reoponsibili-ties in Indochina would be strongly resisted, but.the U.S.

should seek to impress upon the French the necessity and desirability of granting the Associated States ever-increasing responsibilities with respect to expansion of their economic, political and military potentialities.
4.	The U.S. Ambassador to Indochina has reported that the French and Vietnamese are in gcneral agreement on the necessity of expanding the Vietnamese Anny by some 57 light battalions inVolving approximately 40,000 troops. The details on financing and the degree of autonomy and military responsibility to be allowed the Vietnamese Army have yet to be decided. It is envisaged that these additional battalions will provide the Franco-Vietnamese forces with sufficient strength to undertake effective offensiVe action in Vietminh-held territory. It is the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that this augmentation of the Vietnamese Army 13 one of the most important and feasible actions that can be taken to Improve the situation in Indochina and that United States support of the program should be undertaken as necessary upon receipt of definite planning data from the French.
5.	The addition of another squadron of transport aircraft would materially aid offensive operations by providing increased troop-carrier and supply support capabilities.
6.	The report of the ad hoc committee, formed in accordance with your memorandum for the Joint Secretaries dated 19 January 1953 and which considered the foregoing projects has a final conclusion:	•
"The final determination of the feasibility of implementation of the augmentation of Vietnamese forces cannot be accomplished until receipt of a concrete proposal from the French Government."
The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the French should be encouraged to expedite the submission of such proposals in order that the United States may take steps to provide such aid an may be deemed appropriate. In this connection the Joint Chiefs of Staff indicated in a memorandum for you, dated 11 February 1953, that plans now under consideration to expand the Republic of Korea Army may introduce some competing requirements, primarily In non-critical items. HoWcver, certain ammunition requirements coald be both critical and competing.
7.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the augmentation mentioned above should be energetically prosecuted and financially ouppovted in order that the Franco-Vietnamese forces will be able to undertake offensive operations during the 1953-54 dry season.

8.	In view of their experience and tho language difficulties involved, it is considered that the French are better qualified to conduct the training of the indigenous forces than United States personnel vrould be. However, it is believed that the French might profit by applying some of the methods the United States forces ln Korea are using in training Republic of Korea troops and officers, ln this connection the Commander in Chief Far East (CINCFE), and General Juin have agreed to exchange French arid Vietnam officers from Indochina to Korea, and Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) personnel to Indochina. Accordingly, thcre appears to be no need for further United States participation ln the training of the Vietnamese forces unless specifically inVited.
9.	The formation of effective Vietnamese forces is handicapped by deficient Vietnamese incentive and lack of qualified indigenous military leadership. Consequently the French should be given encouragement to grant Vietnamese forces more military autonomy and to train indigenous officers to assume more responsibility for control of local forces.
10.	Although the U.S. Air Force has recently assigned some aircraft maintenance crews, on a temporary basis, to help the French OVercome a critical period in their aircraft operations, it is considered that the French have the ability and can provide the personnel which Would pennit maximum utilization of their aircraft. Current practice provides for Military Assistance AdVisory Group (HAAG) to obtain the aid of special technical groups front the U.S. Services whenever there is a need to instruct the French'in the maintenance and operation of United States supplied equipment. This type of assistance io deemed adequate to mect current maintenance requirements.
11.	In studying possible courses of action to be taken in the defense of Indochina, the inadequate port facilities at Haiphong and air facilities in the Hanoi area haVe been pointed up as major items in restricting the support of military operations. The Chief, HAAG, Indochina, has mentioned that the movement of supplies into the delta could be speeded by two or three months if Haiphong were able to receive and unload deep-draft vessels. The air depot at Bien Hoa io in particular need of expansion in order to accelerate air shipments. The improvcmcnt of the port and air facilities would not only provide impetus to military operations, but'would benefit the economic status of Vietnam. Such improvement could be made with U.S. monetary and material aid, but ln order to avoid possible Chinese reaction, significant numbers of U.S. personnel should not be utilized.

12.	In a letter to the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army, dated 20 December 1952, the Chief, MAAG, Indochina stated that the shortage of French Air Force personnel has had considerable adverse effect on operations. He mentioned that, as a conservative estimate, the sortie rate could be doubled if the personnel strength were increased by one-third. The U.S. Ambassador to Indochina and the U.S. Consul, Hanoi, have both reported that French officials in Indochina will press for an increase in the air force personnel ceiling for Indochina. It is believed the French should be encouraged through diplomatic channels to increase the Indochina air force ceiling.
13.	Active combat participation by the United States in the Indochina opcration is not favored in view of the capability of France and the Associated States to provide adequate forces therefor, and present United States- world-wide military commitments.
14.	However, in order to provide impetus and support to the military operations in Indochina, it is recommended that:
a.	The French Govcrnment be encouraged to take early action to augment the Vietnamese forces and increase their air force personnel strength in Indochina.
b.	Steps bc taken to improve the port and air facilities in the Tonkin Delta area as early as practicable.
c.	The United States furnish material and financial support to asnist in accomplishment of a and b above upon receipt of a definite program from the French'.,
d.	The United States give serious consideration' to utilizing this increased support to impress upon the French the necessity and desirability for granting the Associated States more responsibility with respect to expansion of their economic and political potentials, and to granting more autonomy to Vietnamese military forces.

QTE Secretary Acheson in December 1952 and I last month haVe discussed with our French colleagues the Indochina situaticn. On both occasions we recelVed indications French GoVernment tzas planning to request US GOVT to increase already considerable share of financial burden of the struggle which it is now bearing. I assume that when Mayer, Bidault and Letourneau come to Washington they will furnish further particulars regarding French GoVernment1s plans and resulting requirements. It may be helpful to them in formulating their position to express to them informally seme of considerations inVolved not only in matter of additional aid but also in continuation American assistance at present substantial leVel. Considerations are:
First, GoVernment and people of US are fully aware .	of importance -to free world of war being waged in Indo-
china by armies- of France and Associated States. They appreciate sacrifices which haVe been and are being made and degree to which Communist plans hare been thwarted by magnificent defense carried out in Indochina against Communist aggression.
Second, we enVisage Indochina situation with real sense of urgency. We believe continued military stalemate will produce most undesirable political consequences in Indochina, France and U.S. Therefore, we heartily agree that -considerable increased effort hawing as its aim liquidation principal regular enemy forces within period of, say, twenty-four months is essential.

do not wish share Franco-Vietnamese responsibility for conduct operations. However, if interested Departments this Government are to urge Congress to make necessary
. appropriations for Indochina for FY 5h, those Departments must be conVinced that necessarily top secret strategic plans for Indochina are sound and can be and will be aggressively and energetically prosecuted.
Third, I share concern frequently expressed in French circles regarding adequacy of the financial contribution to prosecuticn of war derived from residents of the Associated States including French businessmen. While I welcome increased Vietnamese Government contribution recently made, I belieVe there is ground for thoroughgoing re-examination this problem into which balance of payment and rate of exchange considerations enter and which of course is of interest to us in its bearing upon the need for US aid.
Fourth, I look forward to opportunity talking with my French colleagues on question of free world policy in Far East as whole and particularly the policies Which we should adopt in order to discourage further Chinese Communist aggression. I hope to reach agreement that speedy defeat of Viet Minh forces in Indochina Would deter rather than proVoke Chinese Communist aggression in Tonicin since it wOuld be a clear indication of our joint determination to meet force with effective force.

Fifth, I should appreciate receiVing any views • which my French friends may care to convey regarding relations between the US and the Associated States of Indochina and particularly regarding participation by latter in discussions of military and ecOnomic policy and in reception of US aid.

EDC vital not only because it provides best mentis obtain German contribution without which no real defense of Europe can be undertaken but also because it provides means for eventual European viability, also impossible keep Germany much longer undcr occupation status.
President declared that EDC so important in American eyes that American people would not support aid to France if they were given impression that France resorting to dilatory tactics in order to postpone ratification this vital development. Therefore when setting forth any conditions precedent to ratification French must be very careful to point out why these conditions are in fact vital to France and not inconsequential details or obstructionist moves.
Concerning Indochina President expressed full American sympathy for valiant French struggle as part of over-all fight against Communist aggression.
He recognized this struggle not just another colonial -war but advised French to make this very clear as many Americans still under misapprehension. President expressed great American interest in French program leading to solution of Indochina problem making clcar that he was not talking in terms of a complete victory. However requests fcr further American assistance could not be considered without full knowledge of French political and military plans permitting US Government to see why its assistance was required and how it would be used. President expressed great interest in measures being taken by French to obtain grcatest possible support by local populations through convincing them they were fighting their own war for their own independence,	.

Re Indcchiha Mayer staffed by referring to NAC Resolution December 1952 re QTE continuing aid UNQTE from NATO Governments. He said French political and military plans would be communicated-to us later during the talks. Meanwhile he stressed his full agreement with President that the task was two-fold: militarily, Associated States Armies had to be developed for victory and for internal pacification. Politically it was necessary to develop popular basis for national governments to protect them from eventual take-over by Vietminh forces. While expressing the greatest interest in Gen Clark’s report following visit to Indochina Mayer was careful to point out differences between Korea and Indochina.
Le Tourneau said that details of recent Dalat agreements would be given to us later but that in meanwhile he can say that these will permit presentation of a Franco-Vietnamese plan which should lead within two years to reduction of Vietminh to a negligible factor in Indochina if no material increase in Chinese or Soviet aid in meanwhile. LeTourneau expressed confidence that popular support for local governments was increasing day by day, pointing to success of January elections in Vietnam, to fact that much more officer material is now availablc for Nation'll Armies and that all enlisted men needed under present financial limitations were available on volunteer basis. Finally he expressed confidence that local populations supported local governmcnts more vigorously now that Vietminh was clearly recognized as the agent not only of Communism but also of traditional Chinese enemy.

Reference to Indo-China, President said of course we were intent upon doing nothing which in any way might increase Francefs difficulties there. Instead we wanted to help. As matter of fact, statement was now being prepared within US Government concerning Far East, and Indo-China and Korea would be linked therein. President added that US representatives had been somewhat disappointed in plan which had been outlined by Mr. Letourneau at Pentagon on March 27 a.m,, particularly by slotmess of its time-table. He wanted to make clear,however, that while there was no US coirmitment to support this plan likewise there had been no US S-^Cbal to do so. Plan required more careful study and President noted that this should be possible as Mr. Letourneau was planning to stay until March 31 p.m.
Re Indo-China plan, Mayer said concerning slotmess of its timet timetable that while raising forces takes time it might perhaps be possible to accelerate.this even if human factors involved might lead to somewhat lower quality of forces. However perhaps more difficult is fact that there exists as yet no agreement -concerning military requirements, Mayer suggested that elaboration of this plan could be completed in Saigon with participation of US officers which Pentagon might care to send there for this purpose and that this aspect of problem could thus be covered by further discussions between military technicians.
President said that US technicians will be glad to cooperate with French along above lines,

THE CHANCE FOR PEACE Address by the President1 White House press release dated April 16 .... . . . . . Now a new leadership has assumed power ln the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, howeyer strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.
...a world that begins to witness the rebirth of trust among nations can find its way to a peace that is neither partial nor punitive.
With all who will work ln good faith toward such a peace, we are ready, with renewed resolve, to strive to redeem the near-lost hopes of our day.
The first great step along this way must be the conclusion of an honorable armistice in Korea.
This means the immediate cessation of hostilities and the prompt initiation of political discussions leading to the holding of free elections in a united Korea.
It should mean, no less importantly, an end to the direct and indirect attacks upon the security of Indochina and Malaya. For any armistice in Korea that merely released aggressive armies to attack elsewhere would be a fraud.
We seek, throughout Asia as throughout the world, a peace that is true and total.
Out of this can grow a still wider task--the achieving of Just political settlements for the other serious and specific issues between the free world and the Soviet Union.

p. A dispatch received from Admiral Radford expressing his views on the strategic situation in Indochina (26O315Z) .	(Annex "F”).”!
It will be noted that General Clark's Views arc somewhat more optimistic than those expressed in this memorandum. This may be due in part to the fact that General Clark's views are probably based almost entirely on information acquired during his brief visit to Indochina.

The Secretary belieVed continuance of substantial economic aid to France will have to take the form of assistance to the prosecution of the Indochina war under some kind of program vihich our military people can tell our Congress seems to make sense and holds promise of a satisfactory outcome, perhaps in a couple of years.
The JCS had reported that the reaction from French visits to Korea was not Very satisfactory, that nothing we were doing there could be used. We were not surprised about that initial reaction because it took our own people in Korea a Very long time to realize the capabilities of the South Koreans. There is a tendency to minimize those capabilities. The problem is to some extent political as well as military. For Instance, while decisions at a high level are taken in Paris regarding the Associated States, implementation or Interpretation in the local light may be in a different spirit, in a community which has so'long been in colonial status and where certain relations haVe been established between white and colored people. For instance, social relations may be lacking and some people not admitted to certain clubs. As far as implements ting those decisions in the field is concerned, and the relations With the local people, we realize that we haVe a similar problem in our south for which we haVe not always found a solution.

It is not easy, but before the U.S., can give any commitment eVen as far as thc ExecutiVe is concerned, we would like to feel that we have answers, or at least observations a) allowing us to picture our help honorably and fairly as not merely economic aid but as aid which has a particular purpose, and b) constituting a program which we could say from the political standpoint is one vthlch has a fair chance of success in changing the rather ■ gloomy aspect of the affair at the present time. With a program for Indochina on a Joint political-military basis it is possible to get our Congress to make a substantial contribution. Our ovzn Congress is desperately anxious to reduce taxes. Taxes are being cut in Britain and in Canada and everybody says we should do the same. Cutting down gOVernmental income means a still larger deficit. Any further aid must therefore be presented in an extremely effectiVe and appealing way to get It through. There is a realization of the critically important role that the French play. "You help us to help you." We haVe explained ways in which that could be done.
MR. WILSON said that we notice in Korea that by training the Koreans we give them confidence and faith, a feeling of unity and competence that they can go on their own, that really gets the people together. Also, he was sure the French look forward to the day v;hen it will not be necessary to have so many troops from France over there. He thought the French wanted them to be strong enough to keep the country free and be part of the spirit of French influence but did not want to haye French’troops there forever in large numbers. If those people can strengthen themselVcs they cannot only meet emergency but also take care of themselVes.
M. LETOURNEAU recalled the time he had spent at the Pentagon to explain the program and the conditions for its realisation. He had said at that time that one cannot seriously doubt -- eVen though it is being ■ done -- the will of France as regards the freedom of Vietnam and the constitution of national armies since they had been doing it for three years. The plan has

been pushed so that French troops can be reduced but also to get the states themselves to develop a national sentiment that will allovr them to face local difficulties as soon as possible.. Complete withdrawal of the French is not involVed. ’ General Clark, when he came to Korea, vias very proud of his Korean army but said that if the U.S. left Korea it would all disappear. Therefore, he wished to maintain the U.S. effort in Korea just like
■ the French in Indochina. It is true that the Laotian affair inyolves a singular aggravation. An operational plan had been given to the Pentagon, including certain ineVitable risks. Within 2-1/2 years, as President Eisenhower has said, it would allow us to arriVe at a situation where the picture would be reVersed although it would not mean complete victory. That plan is essentially based on the deVelopment of national armies. It requires for its solution finances, cadres and rapid training of units.
The French missions which have been receiVed in Korea were very useful. Marshal Juin himself has brought back Information that the French propose to use ln the formation of the Vietnam army. But the problem is not the same ln Indochina as in Korea. The problems facing the two armies are not comparable, but some lessons can be applied.
M. LETOURNEAU did not believe that Saigon hcad-quarters can be fairly accused of not entirely applying the political policies of Paris. The French have no reason To fear that the Vietnam government would be more demanding vzhen they haVG an army. Their exigencies are not worrisome since the Vietnam gouernment cannot pursue any other policy. He said he had not many ways of showing good faith and the good faith of his subordinates except perhaps to submit to a lie detector, whichrwould not be customary. As to racial discrimination, the question of clubs, the problem has neVer arisen in Indo-• china as in other colonies because there has always been close touch between local and French families. The problem arises even less now that there is a Vietnamese

The French generals are not more stupid than other generals, and they want victories and know that their only hope are the natiVe armies, and the key to that is confidence in and fairness to the Vietnamese.
He had the feeling that the operational plan discussed in Washington seemed convincing to the people he saw there and that not much else could be done. The solution seemed reasonable and if the plan were put into effect the only problem would be financial. It was felt that Congress would find it acceptable. It remains capable of execution eVen today. The Laos affair is unpleasant but it should not interfere with the deVelopment of the Vietnamese forces.
SECRETARY DULLES replying to M. Pleven’s second question, said it vzould be the hope of the ExacutiVe Branch of the U.S. government -- we can ?.t the present time speak only of recommendations to Congress -- that if there is a program for Indochina which has the endorsement of our military advisers, which has a chance of success, would propose a fighre comparable to $525 million for this year and there are circumstances where we might possibly increase that a little bit. HoW-eVer, that vzould haye to be a program where we could in effect say to Congress: This program has enough chance of success that if you InVest a certain amount for a certain time, it will largely clear up the situation — not, as M. Letourneau has pointed out, in terms of actual victory but by reducing the dimensions similar to those in Malaya or with the Huks in the Philippines. Then there was the question whether we do that if the French reduce their over-all military expenditure. That would mean that we assume a larger percentage of the total rather than an increase. Some slight adjustment may not be impossible but we felt that it would not be Very practicable to do that on a scale that our people felt the French had run out and we were holding the bag.

At Sta.te-JCS meeting April 24 JCS in informal diacuSGion mado it clear they attach great weight to reservations they have tn de no to feasibllitv and nrospects of success of nllitary plan for IndoChina presented by French in Vashington. It is apparent Chiefs feel that plan might be "workable'1 but only if French pursue course of action which would in effect remove basis for JCS reservations. JCS described this course of action as including such things as appointment bold and aggressive French military lender to IndoChina Command, revision French strategy in direction more immediate end telling offensive action, use Vietnamese forces in large rather than small units etc.
JCS informally stated belief it was imperative US should forcefully present such ideas to French and that unless French would follow such advice it was possible US aid to French for Indo-China would in fact be wasted.
JCS felt US Government nosition could only bc developed after Secretary's return from NATO meeting and that promptly thereafter it might be wise have joint military and noliticrl discussions with French in Paris.
Above JCS views suggest caution in indicating to French now that US annrbveS French military plan.

TRIPARTITE U.S.-U.K.-FRENCH MEETING1
Paris, April 25, 1953

U.K. -- Messrs. Butler, Lloyd, Alexander, Harvey.
French -- MM. Bidault, PleVen, Letourneau, Parodi.
[Secretary Dulles said that President Eisenhower in his recent speech] mentioned the end of direct and indirect attacks on Indochina, so that the armies released in Korea will not strike elsewhere. We must recognize that here we are dealing with a more complicated situation, because the conflict in Indochina has not yet fully receiVed the status of an international war or an international act of aggression. In this connection, the Secretary thought it wise if at some appropriate time the French goVernment were to giVe consideration to the possibility of a complaint being made by Laos or by France, or jointly by both, in the Security Council, about the inuasion of Laos. This vzould giVe thc conflict more international standing and would make it more readily a subject for International negotiation and settlement, which it is not today.
With respect to a complaint to the Security Council by Laos or by France or by both, the British government would follow the wishes of the French goVernment. As regards a Korean armistice, Mr. Lloyd felt his government would be completely in agreement with the line the U.S. Government or the UN Command were taking, namely that we cannot have an IndefinitiVe prolongation of those talks. Horever, if there is a possibility of the

meetings being broken up, we should have a lot of discusSiori so that thc public relations can be properly prepared.
We would also get the benefit from the Indian resolution. Mr. Lloyd hoped there would not be an instruction of the U.S. Government to the UN Command of which others would be glVen Very little adwance notice. If the talks are going badly, then we want to be Very careful hot; they are broken up.
In conclusion, Mr. Lloyd summarized his position by saying that in his View disarmament should wait, Germany should wait, and that Austria might well be tried. He vias most worried, he said, about how Indochina fitted into the picture. It would be Very helpful for us to discuss how we see the Indochina campaign deVeloping and what action in the political field we can take to help the French goVernment. He did not quite see how it fits into the picture of how we are to doal with the SOVlet Union.
As regards the question whether Germany or disarmament should firat be discussed, let it be supposed that it were Gernkany. In that case, M. Bidcult was not sure Whether the influence of public opinion in Germany an’d in France would not become very strong. There are those Who think the German danger as big as the Russian danger. If Germany were then neutralized, we would have a Vacuum at the center of the Continent. There would be great difficulty in refusing a proposal Which would keep Germany disarmed. On the other hand, if we make disarmament the posltiVe test this difficulty would not exist. M. Bidault was not against other tests, as in the case of Austria. It is not a French expert who has said that Russia might accept the western proposal for free elections. Germany would in effect be put up for auction vrith both sides bidding for her, and we would be ' caught in our own trap.

• • * MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
I discussed with Foreign Minister Bidault on Saturday April 25 and with Prime Minister Mayer on Sunday April 26, the question of raising in the Security Council the question of the Communist aggression from Viet Nam against Laos. Both indicated a reluctance to take this step, a reluctance born out of fear that this might precipitate a colonial debate.
I expressed the view that the danger of this in the Security Council might not be as great as in the General Assembly and that it would probably be possible to find out in adVance what the result would be in the Security Council, recognizing that Soviet Russia would, presumably, interpose a Veto.
I pointed out that it was difficult to treat this Indochinese war as an international matter, perhaps to be discussed between the SoVlet Union and the Western Powers, if the French and the Associated States themselVes treated it as a purely civil war matter.
I said I had not come to any definitiVe conclusion but thqt I felt the matter should be explored.
Both Mayer and Bidault agreed to such exploration and to further exchange of Views through diplomatic channels.

MEMORANDUM
At a meeting with the President at the White House this afternoon for the pul-pose of briefing the President on the recent NATO Paris meeting and bilateral talks with the British and the French, the President asked Secretary Dulles what the French views were on the situation in Laos.
The Secretary replied that the French were very gravely concerned about the situation there. He said that when he had net with Prime Minister Rene Mayer last cvenihg just prior to departure from Paris, M. Mayer had stated that the French needed more urgently the loan of some C-119 aircraft to help them get tanks and heavy equipment into Laos to assist in its defense. Having such equipment might mean the difference between holding and losing Laos. M. Mayer had envisaged U.S. Air Force personnel operating the aircraft during the period of the loan.
The Secretary said to the President that such a procedure would mcan the sending of U.S. pcrsonnel on combat missions in Indochina. This, obviously, was a decision which would have repercussions and would raise many problems. However, there was an alternative, which would be to lean the French the C-H9's, which he understood the Department of Defense was willing to do, and have civilian pilots fly them. Following his return to Washington this morning, the Sccretary had made inquiry and had ascertained that there Were pilots in Formosa who were not members of the U.S. armed forces and who might well be able to carry out thcse missions. This possibility was being explored on an urgcnt basis to see whether it would not be possible to have the aircraft loaned and the abovementioned personnel in Formosa operate them.

THE PROBLEM
To estimate French Union and Communist capabilities and probable courses of action with respect to Indochina and the internal situation throughout Indochina through mid-1954.
ASSUMPT1ON
There is no major expansion of the Korean war.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Unless there is a marked improvement in the French Union military position in Indochina, political stability in the Associated States and popular support of the French Union effort against the Viet Minh will decline. We believe that such marked improvement in the military situation is net likely, though a moderate improvement is possible. The over-all French Union position in Indochina therefore will probably deteriorate during the period of this estimate.
i 2. The lack of French Union military suc-' cesses, continuing Indochinese distrust ' of ultimate French political intentions, 1 and popular apathy will probably con-tinue to prevent a significant increase in Indochinese will and ability to resist the . Viet Minin.
3. We cannot estimate the impact of the new French military leadership. How-ever, we believe that the Viet Minh will

lieve that the French will continue without enthusiasm to maintain their present levels of troop strength through mid-1954 and will support the planned development of the national armies of the Associated States. • /
6.	We believe that the Chinese Communists will continue and possibly increase their present support of the Viet Minh. However, we believe that whether or not hostilities are concluded in Korea, the Chinese Communists will not invade Indochina during this period.1 The Chinese Communists will almost certainly retain the capability to intervene so forcefully in Indochina as to overrun most of the Tonkin delta area before ef-
fective assistance could be brought to bear. .*	.
7.	We believe that the Communist objective to secure control of all Indochina will • not be altered by an armistice in Korea or by Communist “peace” tactics. However, the Communists may decide that “peace” maneuvers in Indochina would contribute to the attainment of Comrnu-nist global objectives, and to the objective of the Viet Minh.
8.	If present trends in the Indochinese situation continue through mid-1954, the French Union political and military position may subsequently deteriorate very rapidly.
DISCUSSION
THE CURRENT SITUATION
9.	Military Situation.2 The Viet Minh occupation of the mountainous Thai country of northwestern Tonkin in late 1952 and the follow-up thrust into northern Laos in April 1953 demonstrate that the Viet Minh have retained thc military initiative in Indochina. Although the Viet Minh did not defeat any large French Union forces in these operations, they did force the French to withdraw the bulk of their offensive striking power from the Tonkin delta and disperse it in isolated strong points, dependent on air transport for logistic support. At. the same time, strong Viet Minh guerrilla elements plus two regular

Viet Minh divisions sufficed to contain the 114,000 regular French Union forces remaining in the Tonkin delta. The Viet Minh now appear to have withdrawn the bulk of their regular forces from Laos. They probably have left behind political cadrcs, some regular forces, and v/ell-supplied guerrilla units in the areas which they overran in order to consolidate Communist political and military control, to prepare bases for future operations, and to pin down French Union garrisons.
10.	The invasion of Laos may have been undertaken as part of a long-range Communist design to develop unrest in Thailand and ultimately gain control of all Southeast Asia. Viewed solely in terms of thc Viet Minh objective to win all of Indochina, however, the Viet Minh offensive in Laos is an extension of the 1952. winter’s offensive in northwestern Tonkin, and represents a shift in Viet Minh military tactics. This shift in tactics is probably largely explained by the inability to defeat the main French Union forces in the y Tonkin delta by direct assault. Faced with this position of strength, the Viet Minh began

during 1952 to turn the bulk of their regular forces toward the conquest of northwestern Tonkin and northern Laos, areas lightly held by isolated French Union garrisons.
11,	In this manner, the Viet Minh probably ■ hope to retain the military and political initiative and, by dispersing French Union forces, to prevent either a clean-up by the French Union in the Tonkin delta or offensive operations by the French Union against Viet Minh troop concentrations and supply installations outside the delta. The Viet Minh ■ may well believe that by gradually extending their base areas in lightly defended regions of Laos, Cambodia, and central Vietnam they can keep French Union forces dispersed and pinned down indefinitely. In time, they probably expect to sap the morale of the ■ Vietnamese and the French and finally so alter the balance of power as to make possible successful Viet Minh attacks against the key areas of Tonkin and south Vietnam.
12.	The deployment of four divisions into Laos by the Viet Minh and the fact that the French did not attack their long and exposed lines of communication typify the over-all 'situation in Indochina. French Union forces still outweigh the Viet Minh in numbers, firepower, and materiel. French ability to air lift troops and equipment., although strained at the present time, provides the French Union with tactical flexibility in planning defensive and offensive operations. The Viet Minh, however, by their skill in guerrilla war, their ability to move rapidly and to infiltrate and control areas under nominal Frcnch occupation, have caused the French to commit large forces throughout Indochina to static defense, thus seriously reducing French ability to take the offensive.
13.	Viet Minh regular forces in northern Indochina have continued their gradual evolution from lightly armed guerrilla bands to a regularly organized military force. They have made noticeable advances in the development of field communications, and, unit firepower has increased although they still possess only limited amounts of artillery. Viet Minh combat effectiveness is still limited
by a lack of medical supplies and an inability to sustain major military operations.
14.	Military aid from the US has enablcd the French Union to equip adequately their regular ground forces. The French air forces, with US logistical support, and with no air opposition, have maintained a fair degree of effectiveness in paratroop operations, supply by air drops, and daylight attacks on enemy supply dumps. French naval forces have improved in combat effectiveness and have maintained control of the seacoasts and inland waterways. However, the Viet Minh have the continuing capability to threaten control of the inland waterways by a mining campaign. Some Vietnamese National Army units have performed creditably in combat, but desertion and “missing in action” figures remain high. For the most part, Vietnamese National Guard and other local security forces lack the firepower, discipline, and leadership to hold positions alone against regular Viet Minh units which infiltrate tlie Tonkin delta.
15.	Although French Union military capabilities have improved slightly, the French Union military effort has been inhibited by considerations of domestic French politics, French security in Europe, and fear of involvement in a war with Communist China. These considerations have caused French commanders in Indochina to forego aggressive military operations that would entail heavy casualties and have prevented them from obtaining reinforcements on a scale that might make possible the defeat of the Viet Minh.
16.	The development of the Vietnamese National Army, promised by the French in 1949, has been retarded by a shortage of officers and non-commissioned officers, by French lack of faith in the Vietnamese and by French fiscal p:oblems. There has also been an vn-willingness among many Vietnamese leaders, not including Premier Tam, to undertake a major mobilization effort until the French Trant further political concessions and until the Vietnamese character of the new army is fully guaranteed.

17.	Political.. Some political progress has been made in Vietnam during the past year. Premier Tam’s administration has enlisted the cooperation of the strongly nationalist Dai Viet leader Nguyen Huu Tri, and nationalist concern over Tarn’s francophilia has to some extent dissipated. Tam has also added to the political vitality, of Vietnam by holding local elections in secure areas of Vietnam. Another Vietnamese program, undertaken with US economic assistance, which involves the relocation of scattered villages in the delta into centralized and defensible'sites may be an important step toward the eventual “pacification” of heavily infiltrated areas. The decisions of March 1953 to increase the size of the Vietnamese National Army while expanding the area of Vietnamese strategic and operational responsibility, could also be of major political significance.
18.	’ Despite these advances, Vietnam still acks the degree of political strength essential for the mobilization of the country’s resources. Tam’s “action” program remains more shad-ow than substance. Elected local councils have no real power, promised land reform and other social and economic reforms which might gencrate popular support have not left the planning stage, and the Vietnamese government is handicapped by incompetent cab-inet ministers and the lack of competent administrators. While Bao Dai refuses to assume active direction of the affairs of state, he remains hostile toward new leadership and democratic activities.
19.	Of more basic importance in the failure of Vietnamese to rally to the Vietnamese government following the French grant of independence within the French Union in 1949 have been the following:
d. Many Vietnamese doubt the ability of French Union forces to defeat the Viet Minh and prefer to remain apart- from the struggle.
b.	The French Government has not dared to promise complete national independence at some future date, as demanded by the Vietnamese, because of the fear that the French national assembly would then refuse to sup-. port a war in a “lost” portion of the French Union.
c.	The Vietnamese, despite many evolu-tionary steps toward complete independence since 1949, are generally inclined to believe that the French intend to retain effective con-trol over the affairs of Vietnam.
d.	Thc nationalist appeal and military prestige of the Viet Minh remains strong among significant numbers of the Vietnamese. 4
20.	In Cambodia, internal political strife has weakened the government, dissident nation-alist elements have continued to sap popular loyalty to the throne, and the King is de-manding greater independence from the French in order to strengthen his political position at home. Meanwhile, the 9,000 Viet Minh combatants in Cambodia, while under fairly constant attack by French and Cam-bodian forces, are capable of exploiting dis-orders which may develop.
21.	Laotian stability has been upset by the recent Viet Minh incursion. The Laotians are generally hostiIe to the Viet Minh but are unable to contribute a great deal to the de-fense of their homeland. A small group of pro-Communist Laotians returned to Laos with thc Viet Minh during the recent incursion. It is led by a disaffected Laotian noble-man, Prince Souphanouvong, and calls itself the “Free Government of Pathet Lao” (Laos).
22.	Meanwhile, the Vici Minh leadership, with Chinese Communist material and advisory assistance since 1949, has demonstrated the necessary zeal, ruthlessness, and tenacity to exploit to the maximum the limited resources at their command. The Viet Minh have ex-panded the area under their complete control and their prestige has probably increased throughout Indochina as a result of military successes in northwest Tonkin and Laos.
23.	In the areas of Viet Minh occupation, Viet Minh control is believed to be effective, and minimum food requirements are being met. Tne Viet Minh have taken on increasingly the conventional characteristics of a “Peoples Republic” and are now engaged in programs to confiscate and redistribute land and to eliminate “traitors” and “reaction-aries.” Although this departure from na-tional front tactics has increased realization

that the Viet Minh are under complete Communist domination, the Viet Minh control many villages within areas of nominal French I Union occupation through terror, compulsion, I and their continued nationalist appeal.
24.	The Viet Minh and the Chinese Communists continue to maintain close relations. It is estimated that there are less than a thousand Chinese Communist advisers and technicians with the Viet Minh in Indochina. The Chinese Communists are providing the Viet Minh with military supplies at an estimated average level of 400 to 500 tons per month, and some Viet Minh troops are sent to Communist China for training. Small Chinese Communist units reportedly have entered the mountainous northwest section of Tonkin on several occasions to assist the Viet Minh against French-supported native guerrillas, but no Chinese Communist troops have been identified in forward areas. There was some evidence during the past year that Viet Minh policy statements may be "cleared,” if not written, in Peiping. Close Viet Minh relations with Communist China are complemented, superficially at least, by equally warm relations with the Soviet Union, but we are unable to determine whether Peiping or Moscow has ultimate responsibility for Viet Minh policy.
PROBABLE TRENDS IN FRENCH UNION CAPABILITIES AND COURSES OF ACTION
25.	French plans for dealing with the war in Indochina now revolve around the development of national armies in the Associated States, particularly in Vietnam. In March 1953, the Franco-Vietnamese High Military Council approved a new program calling for an increase in Vietnamese strength during the current year of 40,000 men, organized in 54 “commando” battalions? A further expansion of 57,000 meh has been proposed for
•The 40,000 are to be recruited and will represent a net increase in French Union strength. Planned transfers of native units from the French Army to the Vietnamese Army will also strengthen the Vietnamese Army but will not represent any net increase in French Union strength.
1954 and will probably be undertaken if the initial reinforcement is successful and if equipment is made available by the US. With these additional Vietnamese forces, the French hope to undertake widespread clearing operations and subsequently to organize sufficient mobile groups to begin by early 1955 the destruction of the Viet Minh regular forces in Tonkin. .
26.	Progress has been made in carrying out the troop reinforcement program thus far, and the Vietnamese may have close to 40,000 reinforcements recruited, trained, and available for combat by early 1954. However, the Viet Minh invasion of Laos and the threat of
■ similar operations will probably keep French mobile reserves deployed outside the Tonkin delta in isolated strong points. The addition of 40,000 untested and lightly armed Vietnamese will not offset the absence of these regular French forces, and effective clearing or offensive operations cannot be undertaken until French Union forces are regrouped. Moreover, the French military leadership has been so dominated by concepts of static defense as to be unable to conduct the planned operations with the vigor necessary for their success. How the new military leadership may alter this we cannot estimate. Finally, w unless the French Union forces prove strong enough to provide security for the Vietnamese population, it will not be possible to sweep the guerrillas out of the areas as planned. Not only will the populace fail generally to provide the intelligence required to rout the guerrillas but, as in the past, they will frequently give warning of the presence of the French Union forces, thus permitting the guerrillas to take cover and later to emerge when the danger is past.
27.	The French are fearful that they cannot achieve a military decision in Indochina. Unless the French Union military plans achieve great, success during the period of this estimate, the conviction will grow in France that the Indochina problem can only be solved through some over-all East-West settlement in the Far East. The difficulties of the French financial position impel the French to seck relief from the mounting costs

SECRET
of the Indochina war, and French apprehen-sions concerning eventual German rearmament not only make them reluctant to in-crease the military establishment in Indochina but impel them to seek the early return of French troops to Europe. The French Government will therefore remain under strong and increasing domestic pressure to reduce its military commitment in Indo-china. On the other hand, the French Gov-ernment is under strong pressure to main-tain its position in Indochina. There is still considerable sentiment against abandoning the heavy investment which France has poured into Indochina. More important, there is great reluctance to accept the ad-verse effects on the cohesion of the French Union and on French prestige as a world power which would accompany the loss of France’s position in Indochina. In these circumstances, we believe that the French will continue without enthusiasm to maintain their present levels of troop strength through mid-l954 and will support the planned development of the National Armies of thc Associated States. At the same time, France will ■ probably continue to seek maximum financial and material assistance for the French Union effort while resisting any measures which would impair French pre-eminence among the Associated States, including the making of any commitments concerning the eventual political status of the Associated States.
28.	Political strength in Vietnam may grow slightly during 1953 as progress is made toward a stronger national army, as the Vietnamese assume increasing governmental responsibilities, and as Premier Tam’s social and political programs serve to decrease distrust of French intentions. There will prob-ably also be a growing understanding, and fear, of the true Communist nature and pur-pose of the Viet Minh. However, these de-velopments will not bring about a significant increase in Vietnamese will and ability to resist the Viet Minh during the period of this estimate because the Victnam leadership cannot in this brief period overcome popular apathy and mobilize the energy and resources . of the people. Moreover, if events should
persuade Vietnam leaders that no progress toward national independence is possible un-der the French or that French Union forces cannot defeat the Viet Minh, it is probable that the political strength of Vietnam would decline rapidly. Substantial Viet Minh mili-tary victories in the Tonkin delta or else-where in Indochina would also produce such a decline.
29.	In Cambodia, political stability is likely to decline as the result of tension between the monarchy, the politically divided people, and the French colonial administration. Even if French concessions to the King insure his adherence to the French Union, unrest in Cambodia or a Viet Minh penetration into southern Laos might force the deployment of strong French forces to Cambodia.
30.	In Laos, political attitudes will be de-termined almost entirely by military developments. The Laotians will probably remain loyal to the French Union if they are de-fended aggressively. They will not, however, offer effective resistance to Communist efforts to consolidate political control if French Union forces retreat from the country or if the French Union forces defend only a few strong points.
PROBABLE TRENDS IN VIET MINH AND CHINESE COMMUNIST CAPABILIT1ES AND COURSES OF ACTION
31.	Viet Minh Capabilities and Probable Courses of Action. Barring serious Viet Minh military reverses, which couid occur if Viet Minh forces should overextend themselves or make frontal attacks on French Union strong points, the Viet Minh regime will probably in-crease its total strength slightly during the period of this estimate. Viet Minh prestige will be increased by their recent gains in Laos. The organizational and administrative effcc-tivencss of the regime will probably continue to increase with experience and Chinese Com-munist guidance. The program of expropria-tion and distribution of lands to tenants now being carried out probably weakens the Viet Minh appeal among some classes, but will

probably strengthen Viet Minh controls at the village level and thus facilitate the collection of rice.
32. Militarily, the Viet Minh are unlikely to expand greatly their armed forces because they are already experiencing manpower diffi-culties. Their combat efficiency probably will increase, however, as the result of a modest augmentation of their unit firepower and a steady improvement in staff planning and co-ordination of forces. The Viet Minh probably will continue to receive a steady flow of mate-rial assistance from the Chinese Communists, ’ and the amount may increase at any time.
The Viet Minh do not have, and probably can-not develop within the period of this estimate, the capability to make such effective use of heavy equipment — artillery, armor, and aircraft — from the Chinese Communists as to permit successful attacks against strong con-centrations of regular French forces. Over a longer period, however, a great increase in Viet Minh capabilities, including the develop-' ment of an air force, is possible.
• 33. We believe that during the period of this estimate the Communists in Indochina will probably attempt to avoid combat except where they can achieve surprise or great supe-riority in numbers. They will attempt to con-solidate Communist controls in “Free Laos’’ and will build up supplies in northern Laos to support further penetrations and consolida-tion in that country. If they reach the Thai border, they probably will attempt to organize guerrilla forces among the Vietnamese in northeastern Thailand, but we do not believe they will have the capability to provide much material assistance to such forces through mid-!954. The Viet Minh forces in Laos may hope to receive assistance from the Viet-namese population in Thailand. The Viet Minh will almost certainly intensify political warfare, including guerrilla activities in Cambodia.
34.	We believe that neither the French Union • nor the Viet Minh will be able to win a final military decision in Indochina through mid-1954. Thc Viet Minh, with their principal striking forces operating from the Tonkin base area, will probably retain the initiative
during the period of this estimate by main-taining attacks against lightly defended French Union territory. The French Union can hold key positions in Laos and may at-tempt by attacks against Viet Minh lines of communication, to prevent the Viet Minh from moving southward in force towards southern Laos and Cambodia. We believe, however, that Viet Minh guerrillas in south-ern Laos will develop sufficient strength to control much of the countryside and that guerrilla activities in Cambodia will be inten-sified. The French Union probably will reduce, but not eliminate, Viet Minh strength in south Vietnam. Viet Minh infiltration of the Tonkin delta will probably be maintained at a high level and the Viet Minh may undertake major attacks against the delta if they can weaken French defenses by drawing French strength elsewhere.
35.	Unless there is a marked improvement in the French Union military position in Indochina, political stability in the Associated States and popular support of the French Union effort against the Viet Minh will de-cline. We believe that such marked improve-ment in the military situation is not likely, though a moderate improvement is possible. The over-all French Union position in Indo-china therefore will probably deteriorate dur-ing the period of this estimate.
36.	Chinese Communist Capabilities and Probable Courses of Action. The Chinese Com-munists will have the capability during the period of this estimate to improve airfields in south China, to train Viet Minh pilots, to con-tinue improvement of transportation facilities, and to increase their present, level of logistic support for the Viet Minh. The Chinese Communists will probably retain their present capability to commit and support logistically 150,000 Chinese Communist troops for an in-vasion of Indochina. The combat efficiency of this potential invasion force could probably be. increased considerably by the use of com-bat-seasoned troops who have been rotated from Korea in the past year. The ability of Chinese Communist forces to sustain offensive operations in Indochina would probably be increased should logistic requirements in Korea remain at low levels for a prolonged period.

37 A Chinese Communist force of 150,000, added to Viet Minh forces, would probably be able to overrun the Tonkin delta area before effective assistance could be brought to bear. The Chinese Communists now have, and will probably continue to have during the period of this estimate, sufficient jet and piston aircraft, independent of operations in Korea, for small-scale but damaging attacks against French Union installations in Tonkin. With surprise, they probably could neutralize the French Air Forces in Tonkin. The Chinese Communist air forces do not appear, however, • to possess the capability at present of conducting sustained air operations in Indochina because of a lack of improved airfields in south China and stockpiles of supplies. Such preparations would take several months.
38. We believe that whether or not hostilities are concluded in Korea, the Chinese Communists will not invade Indochina during the period of this estimate? Although they possess the capability, the following considerations militate against intervention by regular Chinese Communist forces or by large numbers of Chinese Communist "volunteers”:
‘The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, believes that the intelligence available is insufficient to permit a conclusion at this time that the Chinese Communists will or will not Invade Indochina prior to mid-1954.
a.	The Communists probably consider that their present strategy in Indochina promises success in a prolonged struggle and produces certain immediate advantages. It diverts badly needed French and US resources from Europe at relatively small cost to the Communists. It provides opportunities to advance international Communist interests while preserving the fiction of “autonomous” national liberation movements, and it provides an instrument, the Viet Minh, with which Communist China and the USSR can indirectly exert military and psychological pressures on the peoples and governments of Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.
b.	Communist leadership is aware that the West, and in particular the US, would probably retaliate against Communist China if Chinese Communist forces should invade Indochina. We believe that fear of such retaliation and of the major war which might result are important deterrents to open Chinese Communist intervention in Indochina.
39. We believe that the Communist objective to secure control of all Indochina will not be altered by an armistice in Korea or by Communist “peace” tactics. However, the Communists may decide that "peace” maneuvers in Indochina would contribute to the attainment of Communist global objectives, and to the objective of the Viet Minh.

Although the inVitation upon Which the mission is based Was conVeycd by the French Primo Minister acting unilaterally for France, it is essential that the military authorities of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia be given a maximum sense of participation consistent With security requirements.

5.	The Chief of Mission will be supported by a carefully selected group of military personnel representing all three Services and with special knowledge of the problems associated with Indochina. The delicate nature of the mission and the difficulty of etccommodating a large group in a war area dictates that the party be kept as'small as possible consistent with th_s requirement. The mission will comprise approximately the following personnel, to be designated by their respective Services: Army - Chief of Mission plus two officers; Air Force-two officers; NaVy - two officers; State Department - one repre-% sentatiVe. It is essential that all members of the mission be aware that this is a highly important military mission concerned with reexamination of U.S.- military policy toward this area of _■	critical significance to U.S. security.

In response to an invitation from the French Prime Minister, when he visited Washington last March, a United States Military Mission headed by Lt. General John W. O'Daniel presently commander United States Army Pacific will arrlVe Saigon June 20. Its purpose will be to pursue discussions with General Henri NaVarre, Commander in Chief Indochina, on the manner in which United States material and financial support of the effort of the French and Associated States armed forces in Indochina may best contribute to the adVancement of theoobjective of defeating the Communist forces there and of bringing peace and security to VietNam, Cambodia and Laos. It is belieVed essential to insure an increasingly close integration of United States assistance with the plans developed by the authorities of France and of the Associated t	States.
Arrangements are being made for the military leaders of the Associated States to participate in these discussions. The Vital role of the national armies of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos and the increasingly important assumption of'high military responsibilities by the Associated States will make these discussions of particular interest.

REPORT OF
THE JOINT MILITARY USSION TO INDOCHINA
In furtherance of the desires of interested agencies
of the United States (see Annex nA"-Background) and in
conformance with the "Terms of Reference for the Chief of the U.S. Military
Mission to Indochina” (Appendix A to JCS 1992/224, copy attached
as
Annex "B"), approved by the Secretary of Defense on 12 June 1953
my party
(see Annex "C") and I arrived in Saigon, Vietnam on 20 June 1953
to conduct
a survey
of the military situation in Indochina.
2
Throughout our stay in the Associated States we were most cordially
received
by officials of the French, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian
Governments. Our first two days were taken up in briefings by the
American Embassy, MAAG, and French and Vietnamese military headquarters
and by staff discussions. Thereafter we returned to Saigon from tine
to time to conduct discussions with French headquarters, the American
Embassy and MAAG, Indochina
3. In order to facilitate our mission ny party split into three
and some times four, groups and traveled throughout Indochina. We were
given complete freedom in selecting our itineraries and on all occasions
were supplied with ample transportation and accommodations by cither
Chief HAAG, Indochina, or the French Armed Forces. This allowed for
"on the ground" familiarization with all objects of military interest
in those areas controlled by non-Communist forces. (See Annex "D" for
detailed chronological presentation of the mission’s activities in
Indochina)
73

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
4. . Our discussions with the French and Associated States military-
authorities were on all occasions conducted in an atmosphere of frankness and military comradeship. I myself was particularly frank in my discussions with General Navarre, and his deputy, General Bodet,- as well as
the Commanding Generals of North, Central and South Vietnam and the French Naval and Air Commander, in which discussions I stressed the need for: (a) wresting the military initiative from the enemy now, (b) immediately initiating the reorganization of French and Associated States
Armies on a divisional basis, (c) reorganizing and improving the training
of the Armies of the Associated States, (d) hastening the turnover of .	.	.	t ■
leadcrship and staff responsibilities, particularly on the divisional
and regimental levels, to officers of the Associated States, and
■ (e) improving the utilization of air and navy potential in Indochina.
Prior to his departure from Paris (.2 Jul 53), General Navarre presented*
me with a written plan of action, henceforth referred to as the "Navarre
Plan" (see Annex nE";, and expressed himself orally along lines which assured me that he intends to take conclusive action toward achieving •	t
his goal.
5* Adequacy of Present Efforts and Plans to Win the War in Indochina: I feel confident that the anti-Communist military forces now in
Indochina, with competent/tand effective reorganization into regiments and divisions, are capable of achieving military victory against the forces currently arrayed against them. (Sea Annex "F" for discussion of opposing military forces) However, this would require a complete change in French military psychology associated with Indochina and would entail some risk, both military and political, in the redisposition of forccs, which the French are unwilling to take.
74
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3 3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
6. Currently, French and Associated otates military forces are not
only scattered throughout the provinces of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin-China, as well as in Cambodia and Laos, but within these areas anti-Communist » ’
forces are holed up in small forts, tc.vers, and fortified areas, Host of those forts have never been subjected to attack. The French have I * '	'	'	’	• f • .
contended these forts are necessary to guard lines of communication and control thc countryside. I feel that a striking force of at least 5 divisions could be mobilized from these forces and mobile reserves by 1 October 1953 for employment as a striking force in the north, and so informed General Navarre in the nature of a suggested plan (see Annex nG")
• for offensive action in Tonkin during the coming dry season (Oct 53 -May 54). This would not denudo any area. General Navarre is somovzhat cautious with respect to reducing troops in inactive areas but lntondo (and so stated in the Navarro Plan) to mobilizo a 3 division striking
force for employment in Tonkin by 15 September 1953.
7.	Though the nay; French High Command is prepared to take certain essential and highly desirable steps in the right direction, thoy will not, and perhaps cannot in view of political considerations, consider undertaking military campaigns designed to achieve total victory with the forces now available. Consequently, complete military victory will await the further development oY the military forces of the Aosociatcd States or ths addition of French divisions from outside Indochina.
75

8.	General Navarre intends, during his current visit to France, to urgently request that the French Government authorize him the loan of the equivalent of at least 2 divisions from French forces outsida Indochina. In view of the French conviction that they do not have sufficient forces in Indochina to win an early victory there, and the fact that the shipment of French divisions to Indochina would go far to-,yard convincing the fence-sitters that France can and will sea this . , •
war through to victory, I believe that the United States should support General Navarre's request.
9.	I can readily understand SHAPE's initial concern over the shipment of•French divisions to Indochina. However, considering that these divisions would be on loan only, that they would be returned at an early date followed by the dividend of thousands of additional battle-hardened ■
and victorious French military veterans, and the great strength which ■ • •’
v/ould accrue to France from a successful settlement of the v/ar in Indochina,
•	I believe the action concerned would be to SHAPE1s great advantage.
10.	Though the addition of 2 divisions, endowed with a divisional concept of teamwork, continuity, impetus, and employment of artillery, could provide the military balance to assure an early victory, I feel . that any addition other than in divisional organization would be in error since it is the divisional team, with its combat proven effectiveness, vdiich is sorely needed, in Indochina.

11• Effectiveness of French Utilization of U.S. Military, Assistance:
|	Inasmuch as U.S. military aid has prevented a Viet Minh victoIy in Indo-
china, it may be said that this aid has been effectively used. To date, French use differs from U.S. use because the overall war effort has been dominated by purely French military thinking. By U.S. standards sore equipment is not used in the most effective manner, such as the use of artillery by single gun or battery in fixed positions, the employment
i	of equipment in static forts, and the dispersion of fire power among
a number of small independent units rather than concentration in a powerful striking force. However, General Navarre has informed me orally, and' I •	•	• .	'	,	a
1	. so stated in writing (see paragraph 3 of Annex "E") that he intends the
• ' ; . early recovery of a maximum number of units from areas not directly involved in the battle, and the reorganization of these units into
I	regiments and divisions for offensive employment in force.
12. In the past, the military aid programs have filled screened
I ■	.	.
deficiencies for units included in the Phased Force Basis, as approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. No activation of units has been delayed due to nondelivery of MDAP equipment. The aid program has been thoroughly coordinated v/ith so much of military planning as relates to the build-up
J	of force.	.	'

15. Political Considerations: General Navarre informed me that he
has complete authority with respect to the conduct of military operations
in Indochina and is unhampered by political considerations. Statements
to the same effect were made by his subordinates. However, it is realized
that this is an oversimplification of the problem. It gees without say-
ing that declarations made in France, reference the war in Indochina

Furthermore, it is believed that certain French
in the past, such as the movement of large French
Luang Prabang, have responded more to political
military requirements. These same political consi-
derations may very probably continue to receive attention in the future
78

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

It is also pointed out that military forces in Indochina include the
national armies of 3 different Associated States in addition to the
French Expeditionary Force. These units of the National Armies of the
■ Associated States cannot be moved between the states vathout specific
permission of the heads of the Associated States involved. (See Annex
"I" on Political Considerations)
16. Adequacy and Scope of U.S, End-Item Supervision of U.S. Military
Assistance: MAAG end-item supervision includes receipt of equipment at
ports, inspection of units in the field and schools, observation of the
use of equipment in operations and inspections of warehousing and higher
echelon maintenance facilities. Until General Navarre took command, the
h
number of field
inspections was limited and excessive advance notice of
intended visits
was required. This problem has been resolved satis-
factorily. For
example, the Army Section is now authorized 30 visits a
month to field units, representing a 100# increase over previous authori-
zation. The present schedule allows approximately the maximum number of
inspections within the Army Section capabilities and permits adequate
supervision under present circumstances. Similarly, supervision of Navy
and Air Force equipment is currently considered satisfactory
17• 0.S. Participation in the Training; of the National Annies of
. the Associated States; My staff and I visited a large number of schools
and training centers engaged in training officers, specialists, cadres
and basics for the National Armies of the Associated States. (Detailed
discussion of training to include the school system is contained in
'.'0 th. a
79
Declassified per Executive Order 13526. Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

Annex "I") With 2 exceptions the training was good, with American methods such as the "committee system" frequently used. The training witnessed in several training installations indicated outstanding aggressiveness and imagination on the part of installation commanders. However, many training centers vtere operating at less than 50^ capacity and suffered from lack of uniformity of instruction, lack of or failure to use necessary training aids, poor organization of instruction and
lack of central command supervision
18.	Responsibility with respect to the training of the armies of the Associated States is poorly defined and I feel that the key to the training problem lies in reorganization to achieve real command supervi-
sion. This can be accomplished throu^l the organization of a French HAAG,
to supervise all training—Army, Navy, and Air, for the military forces of the Associated States, along the lines of our KAMAC- in Korea. General Navarre has agreed to this concept. Furthermore, General Navarre has agreed to the inclusion of 3 U. S. officers in the French MAAG, with 2 French officers in turn working with General Trapnell’s organisation.
' 1 J
This will allow for indirect U. S. participation in the training of the
National Armies of the Associated States. I do not believe that direct U. S. participation in the training of the Armies of the Associated States is either desirable or feasible, primarily because it is unnecessary, manpower requirements would be very large and the French would to object most strenuously.
80

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
19.	In discussions on all levels my party and I strongly urged the
French to utilize their present school and training center plant facility
to capacity for the training of indigenous personnel and establish additional facilities vthere necessary in order to expedite the development
of the indigenous armies. The French accepted this concept with the
reservation that inasmuch as no additional qualified students may be
available, following utilization of the present large training plant
facility to capacity, the need for further expansion may be eliminated.
Furthermore, I strongly believe that U. S. schools should be utilized
not only to train Vietnamese instructors, but also to acquaint the Viet

namese with U., S. training methods.
20.	Employment of Associated States Military Potential: Manpower
resources available in the Associated States are capable of supporting
T
considerable expansion beyond currently programmed increases in the
Armies of
the Associated States. Bao Dai stated that
Vietnamese forces
• alone arc
capable of expansion to 500,OCO men. Other
Vietnamese
officials
reiterated that their army could and should
be expanded to at
least double current plans. This is a commendable attituda but pay,
equipment and training are the limiting factors.
21.	Although a considerable increase in Vietnamese support of the
M
war has been made during the past year (Vietnam has reportedly increased
i
J
its defense budget .by 30O1& since President Tam took office), Vietnam
retrains capable of increased financial support of the v/ar effort, as does
Cambodia. This does not hold true for Laos, with its primitive economy
J
and present complete dependence on France for budgetary support. It is
the opinion of Ambassador Heath and his staff that the Associated States

MW should be able to increase military expenditures in view of additional
financial contributions from outside Indochina (measured in piasters)
which should result in increased incomes and permit increased tax re-
ceipts

dations
The amount .of taxes collected is also capable of expansion
improved tax collection. Doctor Sumberg, an American financial
is currently in Indochina conducting a 3 month study of the tax
of the Associated States prior to making appropriate recommen-
22. Currently, little or no industrial support of the war exists
in Indochina. The adaptability of the indigenous population to specialist
requirements and the existent support, with very little means, of a large
and complex civilian transportation system in the larger cities of the
Associated States, emphasize the existence of a technical knowhow, a
fundamental requirement for any industrial base. Capital is either non-
; existent or carries prohibitive interest rates. The advisability of
U.S. support of a small arms industry, tire factories, battery factories
garment factories, etc. becomes one of weighing comparative costs of
local production against outside procurement. On a short term basis
importation appears most economical for the majority of items, but
. detailed studies must and should be made by qualified experts to assure
that
this is correct. With respect to certain itdms of military support
such
as battery production or tire recapping, local production appears
most
economical. Currently, a large proportion of batteries received

Commercial control is in the hands of the French, who not only control the very little industry whiCh navi exists in the Associated States, but also make reportedly large profits through the importation of French products. Any plans for the development of Vietnamese industIy will encounter the opposition of these French commercial interests.
23.	The French have been very tardy in the turnover of military leadership responsibility to officers of the Associated States. However, there has been some noteworthy, progress recently. I was informed by the % Vietnamese Chief of Staff that forty-odd battalions are new commanded by Vietnamese officers. His Majesty, Bao Dai, has signed a decree establishing a "National War College", site not yet selected, to train division commanders and other general officers. In my discussions with General Navarre and his staff, I repeatedly emphasized the need for expansion, to include regimental and division commanders, of a system already initiated on the battalion level in the Associated States and proven on all levels in Korea, that of attaching French advisers to indigenous commanded units of the National Armies of the Associated States. General Navarre has agreed to expedite the turnover of command to native leaders of the Armies of the Associated States as well as giving those armies a "more and more extensive place as well as more and more autonomy in the conduct of operations". • •	- -, _ *'

24.	Utilization of Korean Military Training Lessons in Indochina:
Korean military training methods can be employed advantageously in the
training of the Armies of the Associated States. Although the French, naturally proud of their own military heritage and partially justified in their claims that the war in Indochina is different from that in
Korea, have verbally minimized the benefits which may accrue to the
Armies of the Associated States from training lessons learned in Korea, ’ the Associated States have already benefited from Korean training. This
-was particularly evident at the Officers' Candidate School in Dalat.
Here LiAAG officers emphasized the considerable improvement, not only in
training methods but also in utilization of plant capacity, since the visit to Korea by members of the Dalat staff. Shortly before our departure we noted increased interest on the part of senior French commanders in making visits to training centers in Korea. More visits to KAMAG training centers in Korea are planned. These visits should include visits by officers of the Hanoi Tactical School (which trains battalion and regimental commanders and staff officers) and the new ’’National War College", when established, to similar training centers in Korea. This is one of the most desirable means by which Korean militaIy training methods may be applied to the training of the Armies of the Associated States.
25.	Development of Associated States Military Forces: With respect to numbers, the indigenous forces of the Associated States are developing according to plan (see Annex "J"). Monsieur 'luat, Vietnamese Minister of Defense, informed ma that 31 of the 54 Vietnamese commando battalions scheduled for organization this year will be operational by 1 October
1953. Hy observations at training camps confirmed Monsieur Quat's

26.	The pricmy deficiencies in the development of indigenous
armies lies in the training of leaders, staff officers and, in a lesser degree, specialists (see Annex "K", Training and Schools in Indochina).
The "Letourneau Plan” calls for the augmentation of an organization
already overwhelmingly preponderant in independent battalions by acti-
t
vating a large number of additional battalions. The'Navarre flan will
1 "build.up progressively a battle corps by grouping battalions into regiments and regiments into divisions and by giving units thus created the necessary support (artillery, engineers, armor, communications) taking into account the very special character of the war in Indochina".
Organization of regular forces along these lines will begin immediately (see Annex "I", Reorganization of French Union Forces). Commando
battalions will initially be employed as independent organizations in
the pacification program wherein they will get some battle indoctrination
and organized into regiments and divisions at a later date. General
Navarre stated that he proposed to keep these battalions on pacification

Taking into account tho current and planned development of

28. Prospects for Wresting the MilitaIy Initiative from the Viet
j - •
1	Minh; General Navarre’s plan of action calls for "retaking the initi-
ative immediately through the carrying out, beginning this summer, of local offensives and by pushing to the utmost commando and guerrilla
;	actions" and "to take, the offensive in the north beginning September 15,
in order to forestall the eneny attack". These planned operations, previously discussed (and covered in greater detail in Annexes "E'1 and ;	"H"), together with guerrilla action and the pacification program,
should assure the wresting and retainin', of the militaIy initiative from the Viet Hinh. Ths timing of the major fall offensive is parti-:	cularly important. Last dry season's campaign was scheduled to begin
about 1 November 1952. The Viet liinh campaign against the Thai country, followed, by their Laotian campaign, was initiated on 10 October 1952, Thereafter, the French merely reacted to Viet Hinh attacks, thus precluding the initiating of French planned dry-season operations.
29. Guerrilla Warfara: General Navarre has a strong memory cf the French Resistance movement in W IT, in which he was active, and told me that he intended to expand guerrilla activities as one of his immediate means of retaking the initiative. At the present time, French-Associated States guerrilla operations are loosely organised at command levels and utilize minor tribal groups in Laos and in Northern and Central Vietnam. They form a thin defensive harrassment line on the outer perimeter of Viet Minh influence in the mountains. French estimates of their strength vary from 3,000 to 20,000.

TO? SECRET • -30. French and Associated States forces are capable of expanding ■ . guerrilla forces immediately, as defenders of their home areas, by
. . increasing the arming of tribal groups now useu as guerrillas. Trained cadres are in being in'these areas and the tribal people will fight the
-• Viet Hinh. Effective harrassment of Viet Hinh coimaunications lines from
the Chinese border and flanking ths Delta perimeter will require stronger - ■ . .
and better trained guerrilla units than now exist, with political convictions to at least match those of the Viet Hinh so that these units can recruit local partisans in thoir area of operations. Concrete ■ ■
suggestions for mounting guorrilla operations prior to 15 September, particularly harrassing the Viet llinh communication line flanking the northern Delta perimater, were made to General Navarre and General Cogny vho expressed favorable reaction.
31.	Guerrilla training facilities were inspected and talks were held with commanders to encourage expansion of training and aggressive action. Present training facilities for guerrilla training will be expanded (see Annex ”11" on Guerrilla Warfare).

'33. The French Tactical Air Force, including F8F fighters and B-26 light bombers, appears well organized and employed. The problem—very-much parallel with Korea—is lack of well defined targets. With an aggressive ground offensive this picture should change for the better.
j	It is adequate in the absence of counter air (see Annex "N").
34.	The Air Transport and Troop Carrier Force is fairly well organized, but could employ more efficient techniques, which have been 'A	*
j	agreed to by the French. The limiting factor, with one reservation, is .
|	the lack of sufficient maintenance personnel. This shortage of personnel
limits operations of all types of aircraft employed in the theater. The
J	exception referred to is lack of numbers of aircraft to airdrop more
titan two battalions at one time. This latter fact was the basis for the request by the French for a squadron of C-U9's. The French state, however, they are entirely in accord with our recommendation that C-H9's are not feasible for continued operational use in Indochina and, according-|	ly, are recommending the withdrawal of their request for the squadron,
as well as agreeing to the immediate removal of the six presently on '	loan from FEAF.
J ■ ••
35.	The requirement still exists, hovrever, for more aircraft if i	three infantry battalions are to be airdropped simultaneously. It
was. recommended to the French, and they agreed, that in the event a three-battalion drop is projected, enough 0-119'5 to make up the lift >	deficiency be loaned to them, subject to high level U.S. approval, for
the three or four days necessary, and that French crews previously chocked out in Germany or elsewhere be on hand in Indochina to make the drop. These same pilots vould supplement the present C-47 crews .	• W SECRET ’

when not otherwise engaged. The probable number of C-H9's to be required is twenty-two (22). This plan would save the United'states several million dollars, in LDAP aircraft am at the same time give the .French the capability of launching a large-scale airborne offensive, • (See Annex "0" for detailed discussion of Air Transport and Troop Carrier Operations).
36.	The Air Logistics picture is the brightest air aspect in Vietnam from the standpoint of improvement shown during the past eight months. Here again, personnel are badly needed. The French have agreed to request Paris for additional mechanics and supply personnel as well as to train additional indigenous personnel to alleviate this condition (see Annex "P").
37.	The Air Training School for the Vietnamese Air Force at Nha Trang is well set up but too limited in numbers of trainees. The French have promised to expand the training of Vietnamese air personnel (see Annex "Q").
38.	In summary, the French Air Force can support an offensive operation with its present equipment, augmented by additional personnel. The loan of C-H9’s for the limited period of a specific operation will give them the capability for a three-battalion airdrop.
39» Utilization of Naval Potential: Both the Tonkin Delta area in North Indochina and the Mekong River Delta area in South Indochina are interlaced with a series of canals and interconnecting rivers that form the country’s main transportation system. This river and canal system provides means for surprise amphibious assaults in both .Delta areas. The enemy offers no resistance to French ships at sea. The French naval forces have sustained greatest damage from mines and ambushes in narrow

and can be expanded but training cf officers is lagging due to the f'-i 1
larger training cycle required. It was recommended that sore temporary

who have served in the French Navy. The French were not receptive. French naval officers appear to hold the Vietnamese in low esteem and are reluctant to turn over responsibility to them. The mission feels that the Associated States personnel can be developed into satisfactory leaders (see Annex "S" for further details on Vietnamese Naval Training).
41.	Amphibious Operations: French Union amphibious operations have heretofore amounted tc little more than patrol operations on the inland waterways and coastal raids. Both the Army and the Navy have river patrol forces which are not coordinated in the higher command structure. The French concept of amphibious operations makes an absolute distinction between operations conducted on the coastline and those conducted on the inland waterways. The U.S. concepts of the amphibious command structure; tactical integrity; and observance of the principles of choice of the objective and concentration of forces; and the adaptability of these concepts in Indochina were presented to the Commander-in-Chief, Naval Forces, Far East (Adtiral Auboyneau). These concepts, while not wholly

I	to reorganize present French Union naval forces and to plan the develop-
ment of expanded forces with the purpose of attaining increased amphibious effectiveness and at the same time delegating increased responsibility
j	to Vietnamese leaders and units. (See Annex "T”)	.
42.	Adr.:inistratjpn and Protection of Liberated Areas: One pressing aspect of the vrar in Indochina is the current insecurity of rear areas.
J	For example, the enemy holds or controls large areas inside the Delta
i ’ ’ ■	•	.'	‘	...	’■
perimeter with military units up to regiments. Much of the lack of a more aggressive spirit on the part of French commanders appears to be
J	based on their concern for security of rear areas.
43.	In North Vietnam, particularly within the Delta, political
J	'
action is being coordinated with military action to pacify the rear
areas. At French Headquarters, North Vietnam, a G-5 has been created as a Bureau of Pacification, working closely with Governor Tri's Civil Conmittee for Pacification. In conjunction with military action, pacification teams establish village and provincial governments, as well as organize and arm village militia for defense against the
Viet Minh. G-5 is new and small, there are political questions reference Governor Tri’s growing strength, and militia are poorly armed to resist Viet Linh attacks on villages. The French are capable of ztcrcjAr/

employing the following general plan. Units already stationed in a •.	. selected area will initiate clean-up operations in that area. As they
progress in their clean-up operations, commando battalions will move 1 * .
in behind the regular battalions, assuring the continued pacification j	of the area by countering guerrilla activities, screening occupants,
and employing psychological warfare to assure the political allegiance 1
of the inhabitants. As the area of operations expands, regular troops j	from adjacent areas will join in the operation and additional commando
battalions will likewise be utilized in a single unified operation. Gradually, as the operation expands with regular troops operating on the perimeter and commando battalions within, certain regular units will become excess and will be transferred to the battle corps in 1 ' . _
Tonkin. In general, the French plan on utilizing two to three commando battalions to replace one regular battalion (see Annex "U" on Pacification).

Psychological warfare is barely started in the Associated States.
I	’	•
There is practically no combat psychological warfare, training is neither uniform nor effective, and enemy weaknesses are not being exploited. Behavior of French Union and Vietnamese forces in occuoying a

51. On 12 July 1953 while at USARPAC, the mission received an information copy of a cable (OEF 943670) rccuesting MAAG Indochina to provide certain data for inclusion in an NSC report, and to develop this data as part of the HAAG work for the mission. Based on information available to the mission and additional data provided by the liAAG, a report (Annex ,rW") furnishing the required data, was prepared.
52. Participation of Associated States Representatives in the Acti-
* vities of the Mission: It was disappointing that Associated States representatives were not present at all briefings by the French. However, officials of the Associated States appeared satisfied with their participation in the activities of the mission. A lengthy briefing at Vietnamese Army Headquarters in Saigon the third day of our visit was followed by discussions between myself and the Vietnamese Minister of Defense and

At training centers visited, representatives of the Associated States were playing a prominent part and participated extensively in the activities of my' mission.	.	'	•	.	.
53« Participation of MAAG Indochina in Activities of the liission: General Trapnell, in addition to supervising all administrative arrangements concerning our activities in Indochina, v/orked in close coordination with the mission at all times.

Progress in offensive * planning and increased aggressiveness in attitude and follow-through were noted even during our brief stay. Once the French became convinced ■ 4 . .

ObViously most serious problem relates to 12 infantry battalions.

ANNEX 2
Text of the French Memorandum
•
1.	One of the essential aims of the free world
is the containment of Communist expansion in the Far East. France is not defending her own Interests alone in Indo-China any more than the United States is defending solely its own interests in Korea.
2.	From the Juridlcial point of View, there is no
connection between the Korean War waged by the United Nations and the war in Indo-China waged by France and the Associated States. But on the Allied side it has often been ascertained by the highest military and political authorities, that the Far East, on a line stretching from Korea to Malaya through Indo-China, constitutes a single front, divided into several theatres of operations.
5.	It is therefore logical that nations which
haVe waged or which continue to wage the same battle separately be united in the pursuit of peace, just as they haVe helped and still help one another in war.
4.	ConVersely, it would be absurd that the con-
elusion <5f an armistice in Korea, ferVently desired by the French GoVernment as well as by all other members of the United Nations, should have as a consequence an increase.in the support lent by Communist China to the Vietminh. The mission of the United Nations would not be fulfilled if the cease-fire in North Asia should result in an intensification of the war in South Asia.
5.	Without being in a position to state that the
prospect of a truce in Korea is the cause, the French GoVernment notes at this Very moment, with great concern, that the supply of war material and articles of all sorts to the Vietminh by-Communist China has considerably increased during the past three months. It is to be feared that this state of affairs is going to deteriorate further during the months to come.

6.	In accordance vrith the decisions taken by
the United Nations, a. political conference i-s to convene within a maximum period of ninety days after the signing of the truce. It is clear that this conference will consider primarily problems relating directly to Korea, which it is specifically instructed to resolve. NeVertheless, the success of its mission, though greatly to be desired, should not result first of all in a worsening of the conflict in Indo-China.
7.	As Was found by the three Ministers of Foreign
Affairs in Washington, it may be difficult, for procedural reasons, to place the Indo-Chinese question on the agenda of the political conference. It should surely not be Tmpossible, howeVer, to see to it that Indo-China profits, at least Indirectly, from a meeting which is Intended to re-establish peace in an area of the Far East, should such an undertaking meet with success.
8.	We shall doubtless soon be in a position to
sense the attitude of Communist China during the political conference, as the representatives of the United Nations certainly do not intend to allow the meeting to drag on indefinitely without results.
If this attitude, as is possible, is entirely negative, it vzould obViously be out of the question to expect the conference to have any beneficial effect upon the situation in Indo-China.
’	I
If, on the contrary, the climate of the conference becomes more favorable, the opportunity may arise— without jeopardizing ln any way a successful solution of the Korean problem--to explain to the Communist representative, unofficially as well as at the ccnference table itself perhaps, that his conciliatory attitude could not limit itself to regions lying north of the J8th parallel, and that he would be assuming an undeniable risk if he sought to localize his peaceful intentions in such a manner.

9.	How could such a maneuver be undertaken? Once
more it would be logical to see to it that the work of the conference progresses pari passu with a ceasefire in Indo-China.
In any case, it is only fair that the work of the political conference should, at the very least, be conducted in such a manner that Communist China:
(a)	can not consider any result as secured (in particular with regard to the eVacuation of military forces) as long as she has not giVen tangible proof of her general goodwill in Southeast Asia.
(b)	receives the impression that the situation in the Far East as a whole is kept constantly under review by the Three Powers jointly and therefore has a direct influence on negotiations which are limited to Korea in principle.
(c)	arrives gradually at the conclusion that her best Interest is to cut down her support of the Vietminh, in order to enjoy the benefits which she might expect to derive from a prolonged or final cessation of hostilities on the 33th- paralle.
10.	'	At the same time, the French GoVernment vzould
continue its efforts to obtain a satisfactory adjustment of the situation in Indo-China, which has just been undertaken both on the political and on the military leVel. Such an adjustment should enable us to regain the initiative in military operations just as we haVe regained it with respect to relations' between France and the Associated States.	'

11.	Such an effort by France and Vietnam coupled i with the political maneuver already outlined might lead the GoVernment of Communist China to reflect whether the policy of supporting the Vietminh is still Justified, and whether it would not be, in the last analysis, more costly to her than the abandoment of an ally who is unreliable except for a common Communist Ideology.

JULY 17, 1953	NO. 387
REPORT TO THE NATION BY THE HONORABLE JOHN FOSTER DULLES,' SECRETARY OF STATE, AND THE HONORABLE WALTER S. ROBERTSON, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1953
...Last Tuesday night we finished a fiVe-day meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and the United States....
In the past, there has been some criticism of the French Republic for failing to promise liberty and independence to the three Associated States of Indochina, -- Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. It was felt that the peoples of these countries needed something of their own for which to fight. The basis for that criticism should now be removed. The French Government has giVen assurance that it stands ready to grant complete sovereignty and Independence to the three Associated States. Negotiations on this matter will start in the near future.
Last Monday, Mr. Bidault, the French Foreign Minister, and I inVited the representatives of these three States to meet with us. We found that they looked forward eagerly to working out arrangements with the French Government to complete their sovereignty and independence. It seemed that they do not want to be wholly divorced from France. They have, with France, strong bonds of a cultural, economic and military nature. These can be presented, consistent with full independence, within the French Union, which, like the British Commonwealth, offers a possibility of free association of wholly independent and soVereign nations.
This action of the French Government makes clear the distinction between those who would grant independence and those who would destroy it. It should make it easier to stop Communist aggression in that part of the world.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

We discussed plans for military operations in Indochina. These are being developed by the French General Navarre who has recently gone there. Our Government sent General O’Daniel to confer with him. We belelve that the new French plans are vigorous and •
deserve to be implemented in that spirit. The United
States has a large interest in the matters because our position in the Western Pacific could be put in jeopardy if Communists were allowed to overrun the Southeast Aslan peninsula of which Indochina forms a major part. We are already helping there with material aid. This inVOlves the second largest cost item of our Mutual Security Program, participation in the NATO Army being first. I believe we should help effective resistance to Communist aggressors everywhere, and in Indochina it may save us from having to spend much more money to protect our vital interests in the Pacific.
We also agreed that an armistice in Korea must not result in Jeopardizing the restoration of peace ln other parts of Asia. In this connection we thought particularly of Indochina.
As President Elsenhower said in his April 16 address,
an armistice ln Korea that merely released aggressive armies to attack elsewhere would be a fraud. We are on our guard against that.
2. Our program for Europe and Asia is a program for peace and for the liberty and justice which are necessary if peace is to be durable. Repression can giVe'the illusion of peace, but it is only illusion. For sooner or later the repression becomes unbearable and human emotions explode v/ith violance. . . .That is why we seek peace in Indochina on the basis of freedom and independence which the French GoVernment now promises the peoples

It is also the nolicy of his goVernment to win the war in Indochina; To do this, they are prepared to adopt the general principles of the l’avarre plan, including sending approximately nine battalions of additional troops to Indochina. However, the cost of sending and maintaining these additional troous in Indochina, plus the cost of arming, training, ar.d equipping the necessary additional battalions of Vietnam troons, will be approximately 100 billion francs for the French calendar year l95h. Therefore, the Laniel government, in order to carry out its overall plan of winning the war in Indochina and balancing the French budget, needs an additional 150 billion francs for Indochina in calendar l95h. Laniel said that the 100 billion franc figure fcr the extra cost in Indochina in 195L was a maximum figure, and that he had instructed General 1avarre to do his best to reduce it somewhat.
Laniel said that lidault had reported, after his Washington trip, that the Secretary of State and Ir. Stassen had told him that there was no hope of getting any additional funds whatsoeVer from the US for Indochina, and that Bidault was very discouraged to haVe to make this report. Laniel added that there Was no point in sending any additional French forces from France to Indochina unless the funds were also available to build up the Vietnam army for its eventual assumption of responsibility. He nointed out that it would be impossible for him to make the economies which he plans to make in the civil areas Of the budget unless he can r.ake similar economies in the military side of the budget, including Indochina. If funds are not aVailable

to carry on in Indochina, the only alternative is eventual withdrawal, the only question being the exact method and date on which the withdrawal will take place. He has instructed General Navarre to prepare a new plan on the assumption that no funds will become aVailable, and this plan will be ready shortly and will be available for our information. ’
Thus, in conclusion, Laniel pointed out that not only the whole question of Indochina, but also the whole problem of balancing the French budget and putting France back into a position where she could make a strong contribution to the European and Atlantic communities, depended on whether or not approximately 150 billion francs additional could be made available for IndOchina in calendar 1954-.

FW 795.00/8-755: Confidential File
[French Embassy] Washington, July 31,1955
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.	The armistice in Korea having come into force, it seems indispensable to the French GoVernment to review at this time the exchange of Views at Washington between the Foreign Minister, Mr. Foster Dulles and Lord Salisbury, concerning the raising of the question of Indochina in the course of political negotiations which are to follow the armistice.
The Foreign Minister on July 14 submitted to his American and British colleagues a memorandum on this question. The present aide-memoire is intended to spell out certain points contained in that memorandum.
2.	The interdependence of the two conflicts in Korea and Indochina is acknowledged, since it has been emphasized at different times in the communiques of the three Powers, and has been affirmed by President Eisenhower and Mr. Foster Dulles. As is recalled in the Declaration of the Sixteen Powers, it will be inconceivable that the armistice in Korea might result In preVenting the establishment or the maintenance of peace in another part of Asia, in increasing the support giVen by China to the Viet Minh, and in aiding in this manner the spread of Communism. It will be incomprehensible if anything is overlooked in trying to extend to Southeast Asia, and in particular to Indochina, the benefits of the relaxation that it is hoped will arise from the end of hostilities in Korea.
The question thus arises of knowing by what means and with what immediate objectiVes one might associate a solution of the Indochina conflict vtith the settlement of problems with which thc Political Conference, called for by the armistice agreement, will deal.	•
3.	With regard to the means, Article 60 of the armistice agreement, by means of the phrase "etc." does not rule out, in principle, that the Indochina question (a) might be formally included, as such, in the agenda of the Conference, (b) or might be taken up' ln the
109

FW 795-00/8-753
examination of the general problem of Communist aggression elsewhere than in Korea, (c) or might be included
in a general discussion of Far Eastern questions.
In any case, it t essential that the inter-
dependence of the different theaters where Communist aggression is taking place not be lost sight of by the Allied negotiators and be clearly affirmed.
4.	On the assumption that it proves impossible for any of the three formulas, indicated above, to be carried out, the matter could be taken up on the fringes of the Political Conference. It could, in effect, be studied, after the appropriate contacts--officlal and restrlcted--had been established with the Chinese representatiVes, in a parallel conference which might be held at the same time, but which need not be of the same nature or the same composition.
This parallel conference could be limited to
the question of Indochina alone, or deal equally with other Far Eastern problemsocther than Korea. It would haVe the adVantage of not having any tie, legally or otherwise, with the United Nations since the latter would have no part in the establishment or in the program of its work. It vtould allow for more flexibility and for more possibilities ln the conVersations. The parties could, in thls parallel conference consider themselVes uninhibited by any preVlous positions taken at the time of the Working out of the articles of the armistice regarding the calling of the Political Conference.
5.	In any eVent, the French Government considers it important that the following consideration guide the conduct of the Allies: that no non-Korean problems of interest particularly to Chlna--viz., admission of its representatiVe to the United Nations, raising the embargo, and the question of Formosa--will be the obj'ect of discussions or of more or less long-range promises until the Indochina problem has been discussed. The French GoVernment could not agree that the Political Conference take up the non-Korean questions if among them is not included--in fact as a priority item--the question of Indochina.
6.	The objective we would wish to attain,.when this question in one way or another is seriously discussed,

would be the end of all Chinese aid to the Viet Minh and the end of hostilities.
The effective implementation of such mea--sures Would allow, after a certain interVal and if the opposing side gives evidence of a true spirit of conciliation, for the preparation and the opening of negotiations•for a political settlement of the problem.
The French Government reserVes the right to consider far more thoroughly this last aspect of the question, together with the Associated States, and in particular with VietnNam, when these exchanges of Views with the American and British gOVernments will haVe sufficiently established thc ways and means most appropriate to the circumstances and to the purpose in mind.
7- The foregoing views haVe also been brought to the attention of the British GoVernment.

The winding up of the Indochina war is a necessary condition tO enable France tO check both these trends and reassume a more confident and pesitiVe role on the continent.
h. The lack of success so far in Indochina is traceable largely tO French.failure;
a.	by timely grants of soVereignty and impressiVe military success 5 tO vzin a sufficient native suppOrt to permit more rapid deVelopment of larger and more effective natiVe armies, and tO frustrate natiOnalist appeal Of the Viet Minh.
b.	to plan and execute aggressiVe military Operations.
5.	The present French government is the first in seVen years which seems prepared to do what needs to be done to wind up the war in Indochina. Its plans offer the United States at last an opportunity to attack the major IndOchinese and Mctrepolitan French problems as a whole. The French Premier has assured Our representatives that his goVernment is anxious to continue the struggle and tO press cn to win, but he can carry tirrough his program against pclitical OppositiOn only if he offers a ’’package" solution, not only of Indochina but of the related French weakness in Europe and at heme. Fcr this purpese the nevz goVernment has developed the following program:
a.	Military, In.iti.atiye. A new commander, Creneral Navarre, has taken. over in Indcchina and is determined t© .assume the Offensive. The initial operations under his command testify tO this resolve. He has revised the plan originally presented in Outline to us by M. Letourneau in March 1953 for breaking the back of Viet Minh resistance during the campaign season Of 195h-55« His plans include an increase in the native armies by approximately the folloWing figures: 5956OO in 1953* 76,000 in l95h, and 20,000 in 1955 for a total of 331,650 by January 1956. At his request, the French government is prepared, despite popular oppositiony tO send nine more regular infantry battaliens plus ancillary units from France, if the rest of the program is agreed on. The Navarre operational plans drawn, up on Indochina Were approVed by Lt. Gen. 0’Danielj USA, in his report on his recent mission.

b.	Political FrOgram. Pursuant to the French declaration Of July 3, M. Laniel has assured U. S. representatives cf his determination to grant genuine independence tc the Associated States without the strings Which haVe marked the prerious grants of "independence". He apparently enVisages something Very much like Dominion status, retaining Only such French authority and priVileges as may be agreed.
c,	Fiscal Rehabilitation. Laniel conceives his project fcr Indochina, as an integral part Of a new and supreme effOrt by France to ’’put its house in order”. He plans tO appreach a balanced budget during CY 19 5h. This Will inVolVe a cut in French military as well as civil expense fcr that year. At the same time he conteo plates a greater effort in Indochina. To do this he asks the U. S. fcr additional assistance amOunting to abcut $4-00 million for FY 19 5h.	.
6.	a. Attached are two tables showing (1) the financing of the Indochina war in CY 1953 and as propOsed fcr CY 1954-? and (2) U. S. aid for France and Indochina under 1953 program and 1954- appropriations. They contain • tentative figures for 1954-.
b.	As the first table makes clear, under the proposed 'program, the United States Would assume about 50 per cent of the 1954- budgetary expenditures ($829 million out of $1,676 million) and, if end-item aid is included, would be carrying abcut 61 per cent of the total financing. This would represent about twO and one-third times the amount of U. S. aid fcr CY 195'3.
c.	As shown by the second table, this program wculd entail an increase Of $4-03 million oVer the assistance nOW planned fcr France (31,286 million). Of the total French military budget for beth Indochina and NATO, the presently planned U, S. aid, including .end itemswould be 26 per cent: if the aid were increased as requested, such U. Si assistance, including end items, Would be 34-per cent of the total, • :	•	. •
d.	Finally, as the first table indicates, under the program, the total expenditures for IndOChina fcr 195'% including end items, would be $2,160 million as compared with $1,700 for CY 1953.

7.	The program presents substantial risks. Under it, the French build-up in Europe would be slowed down in some degree, both by the limited troop diVersion and the cut in the Flench military budget. MoreoVer, in the best of circumtanceSj the Indo-Chinese war cannot be successfully closed out before the 195^-55 fighting season. Consequently, in addition to any supplemental aid furnished now, we Would haVe to contemplate a comparable further contribution a year from now to assure a satisfactory conclusion. Furthermore, there is the risk that the French Union forces in Indo-China might suffer reverses before the projected additional effort can be brought to bear.
8.	Despite these risks and uncertainties it is belieVed that the U. S, should agree, in its own security interests, to furnish the additional ^hOO million of aid to France . •ILripus factOrs lead to this conclusion:
a.	The Laniel government is almost certainly the last French government Which would undertake to continue the vzar in Indo-China. If it fails, it will almost certainly be succeeded by a goVernment committed to seek a settlement on terms dangerous tO the security of the U. S. and the Free ’world. The negotiation of a truce in Korea, added to the frustrations and Weariness of the seven years’ war, has markedly increased the sentiment in France for seme kind of negotiated peace in Indo-China. In the recent protracted French governmental crisis, euery leading candidate bid for popular support with some kind of promise to reduce the Indo-China commitment in some Way. For the first time in seven years, latent defeatist impulses emerged into real efforts by political and parliamentary leaders to "pull out".
b.	Under present conditions any negotiated settlement Would mean the eventual loss to Communism not only of Indo-China but of the Whole of Southeast Asia.
c.	The loss of Indo-China would be critical to the security of the U. S. Communist control of Indo-China Would endanger Vital raw material..sources, it woltld weaken the confidence of other Southeast Asian states in Western leadership; it Would make more difficult and more expensive the defense of Japan, Formosa and the Philippines; and complicate the creation of viable Japanese economy. If the French actually decided to Withdraw, the U. S. would haVe to consider most seriously Whether to take oyer in this area.
d.	On the other hand,if the proposed program does succeed, and the French are able to achieve Victory in Indo-

China within two years, the effect Will be to strengthen the Free World and our coalition in Europe as Well as Southeast Asia. France Will be enabled to adopt in Europe the active role which her weakness has undermined in the preceding period.	.	-
Recommendation
9.	AccOrdingly it is recommended that the National Security Council agree to an increase in aid to France in the current fiscal year by an amount net exceeding $4-00 million above that already committed, prorided Only that (a) the Joint Chiefs of Staff inform the National Security Council that in their view the French plan holds the premise of military success; and (b) the Director Of the Foreign Operations Administration ascertain the available SOurces Within currently appropriated funds and, the extent to Which a special supplementary appropriation will be necessary when COngress reconvenes in January 19ph.	.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: The Navarre Concept for Operations in Indochina.
1.	In a memorandum for you, dated 21 April 1953, subject: "Proposed French Strategic Plan for the Successful Conclusion of the War in Indochina," the Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out certain weaknesses in the LeTourneau-Allard plan, but felt that it was workable. During the visit of the U.S. Joint Military Mission to Indochina, Lieutenant General Navarre submitted in writing to Lieutenant General 0'Daniel, Chief of the Mission, a paper entitled, '"Principles for the Conduct of the War in Indochina" appended hereto, which appears to correct these weaknesses and which presents a marked improVement in French military thinking concerning operations in Indochina.	.
2.	In his report Lieutenant General 0'Daniel stated that, in his opinion, the new French command in Indochina will	V
accomplish under' thc Navarre concept thc decisive defeat of r . the Viet Minh by 1955 and that the addition of two or more	x
French divisions from outside of Indochina would expedite this defeat. Additions other than in divisional organization — would be in error since it is thc divisional team, with its	a
combat proven effectiveness, which is sorely needed in Indo-	;
china. Lieutenant General O’Daniel further reported that	V
French military leaders were most cooperative with the mission, _____. that several agreements were accomplished to improve the
effectiveness of the proposed military operations, and that repeated invitations were extended to the U.S. mission to return in a few months to witness the progress the French will have made.	.
3.	Based on-past performances by the French, the Joint Chiefs of Stafx’ have reservations in predicting actual results which can be expected pendin additional proof by demonstration of continued French support and by further French performance in Indochina. However, if Vigorously pursued militarily in Indochina and supported politically in Franco, the UaVarre concept offers a promise of success sufficient to warrant appropriate additional U.S. aid required for implementation. 'Such aid to France and the Associated States resulting from U.S. support of the Navarre

concept should be based on needs of the French Union Forces in Indochina for additional equipmcnt necessary to implement
. the organization of thc 'Battle Corps" envisa, ed by th‘e Navarre concept and necessary support of the planned expansion of indigenous forces, such needs to be screened by thc Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina. In addition, to improve the chances of success, this support should include continued close liaison and coordination with French military authorities together with friendly but firm encouragement and adVicc where indicated.
4.	Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the necessary support should be provided to permit full and vigorous implementation of the Navarre concept, conditioned upon continued implementation of French support, demonstration of French intent by actual performance in Indochina, and continued French willingness to receive and act upon U.S. military advice. Further, the French should be urged at all levels to support and Vigorously prosecute .the Navarre concept to the maximum extent of their capabilities.

The Kav ore Concept for Operations in Indochina.	.
1.	In a memo rand it?, f >r you. dated 11 August 1953, subject: "The Navarro Concept for Operations in Indochina, : the Joint Chiefs of Staff commcnted on thc Navarre concept and its "promise of success . It is understood that the Secretary of Defense contemplates sending a copy of the reference memorandum to the Secretary of State in thc immediate future under coyer of a memorandum (Enclosure) which was passed informally to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, for comment by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
2.	Though the Joint Chiefs of Staff remain in general agreement with the m•morundum of 11 August, it is bclieVed that certain changes therein are appropriate prior to forwarding it to the Secretary of State. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider the second sentence of paragraph 3 to be overly optimisttc with respect to the 'promise of success ' offercd by the Navarro concept. Though vigorous military prosecution in Indochina and political support of the Navarre concept in Franco arc fundamental, it Is bel'eved a basic requirement,for military success in Indochina is one of creat'D;; a political climato in that country which will pro-vidc the incentive for natiVec to wholeheartedly support the French and supply tin m tri th adequate intelligcnce Vital to the successful conduct of military operations in that country.
3.	In furtherance of the 0'Daniel Mission the Joint Chiefs of Staff are receivln_ Progress Reports from Indochina. A report dated 24 August 1953 states that the French are not in fact pursuing agrocmcuts reached between General G'Daniel and General lNavacm ('ncluding the Navarre concept) as vigov-ously as expected by General O'Daniel and contemplated by him in his report. Specifically, General Trapnell, in his 24 August Progress Report, states that (a) the French have :'no plans for a general fall offensive beyond limited objective

4.	In order to accurately present current views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Secretary of State, it is suggested that a new memorandum dated 23 August 1953, which is being forwarded separately and which reflects the views expressed in the above paragraphs, be substituted for the memorandum of 11 August as an enclosure to your proposed memorandum to the Secretary of State. In addition, in order to point out more clearly that military success in Indochina is dependent upon the manner in which operations are conducted, it is recommended that the last paragraph of the draft letter to the Secretary of State (Enclosure) be changed as•follows (changes indicated in the usual manner):
"There is attached for your information a memorandum to me from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, datcd ll-AHguBt-J953 2o August 1959, which otetbed s_tatos that thc present Navarre concept appears to correct the crcViously indicated weaknesses and from their viewpoint presents a marked improvement in French military thinking concerning operations in Indochina.

Further, the French should be urged at all levels to support and vigorously prosecute the Navarre concept to the maximum extent of' their capabilities."

In a memorandum for you, dated 21 April 1953, subject: "proposed French Strategic Plan for tho Successful Conclusion of the War in Indochina,11 thc Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out curtain waakncsscs ln the LeTourneau-Allard plan, but felt that it vras Workable.

2.	In his report Lieutenant General O’Daniel statcd that, in his opinion, the new French command in Indochina will accomplish under the NaVarre concept the decisive defeat of the Viet Minh by 1955 and that the addition of tWO or more French divisions from outside of Indochina would expedite this defeat. Additions other than in divisional organization .would bo in error since it is tho divisional team, with itc_cc::bat proven effectiVcness, Which is Sorely needed in Indochina, Lieutenant General O’Daniel further reported that French military leader's were most cooperative with the mission, th t several agreements wore accomplished to improve the effectiveness of thc proposed military operations, and that repeated inVitations were extended to thc U.S. mission to return in a few months to witness the progress the French will haVe made.

If this is accomplished and if tho Navarre concept is vigorously pursued militarily in Indochina and given Wholehearted, political support in France, it does offer a promise of military success sufficient to warrant appropriate additional U.S. aid required to aooiot. U.S. support of the Navarre concept should bo based on needs of thc French union Forcss in Indochina for additional equipment necessary to imploment the organization of the "Battle Corps" envisaged by the Nayarre concept and necessary support of the planned ex-pan—lGn of inuigenouS forces, such needs to be screened by the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina.

THE HONORABLE JOHN FOSTER DULLES SECRETARY OF STATE BEFORE THE AMERICAN LEGION AT KIEL AUDITORIUM, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI at 11:30 a.m., CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME (l2:pO p.m., EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME) Wednesday, September 2, 1955
The War in Indochina
We do not make the mistake of treating Korea as an isolated affair. The Korean war forms one part of the world-wide effort of Communism to conquer frecdom. More immediately it is part of that effort in Asia.
A single Chinese Communist aggressiVe front extends from Korea on the north to Indochina in the south. The armistice ln Korea, even if it leads to a political settlement in Korea, does not end United States concern in the Western Pacific area. As President Eisenhower said in his April 16th speech, a Korean armistice would be a fraud if it merely release Communist forces for attack elsewhere.
In Indochina a desperate struggle is in its eighth year. The outcome affects our own vital interests in the Western Pacific, and we are already contributing largely in material and money to thc combined efforts of the French and of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
We Americans haue too little appreciated the magnitude of the effort and sacrifices which France has made ln defense of an area which is no longer a French colony but t-zhere complete Independence is novz in the making. This independence program is along lines which the United States has encouraged and justifies increased United States aid, provided that will assure an effort there that is Vigorous-and decisive.

Communist China has been and novr is training, equipping and supplying the Communist forces in Indochina. There is the risk that, as in Korea, Red China might sehd its own arhty into Indochina . The Chinese Communist regime should realize that such a second aggression could not occur without grave consequences v/hlch might not be confined to Indochina . I say this soberly in the interest of peace and in the hope of preVenting another aggressor miscalculation.
We want peace ln Indochina, as well as in Korea. The political conference about to be held relates ln the first Instance to Korea. But growing out of that conference could come, if Red China wants it, an end of aggression and restoration of peace in Indochina. The United States would welcome such a deVelopment.

September 9, 1953
ITEM 2	_
(For Consideration)
FURTHER U.S. SUPPORT FOR OPERATIONS IN INDOCHINA
SUMMARY AND COMMENTS
1.	This very important and complex matter is being rushed to such an extent that there remain a number of questions which are not completely answered at this time, However, a successful termination to the Indochina problem is so desirable with respect to all our Far Eastern policies, and the pressure of time so great due to the approaching end of the rainy season there (about October 1 — after which major operations by the Viet Minh may recommence), that action in principle if felt to be essential by thc Secretary of State is warranted at this time. The State Department asserts that if this French government which proposes reinforcing Indochina with our aid, is not supported by us at this time, it may be the last such government prepared to make a real effort to win in Indochina. (This maybe somewhat over-pessimistic.)
2.	This brief is written without having available the fine! papers upon which the NSC will be asked to act. These are still (7 September) in process of being drafted by the State Department. However, we are aware generally of their probable content.
3.	As you remember, General Bedell Smith presented to the NSC on 6 August the proposals of the Daniel government to finish up the Indochina situation. This involved a request for about $700 million additional U.S. aid (now $385 million), and Daniel’s statement that his program for Indochina would have to be paralleled by a program to balance the French budget or it would not be politically acceptable to thc French Assembly. The NSC (see Tab "A", Action No. 874) agreed at this time that State, FCA and the JCS should proceed promptly with further exploration with the French and that if these agencies felt the French program held promise of success, they should submit detailed recommendations to the NSC. This has now been done and the recommendations will be considered at Vednesday's meeting.
4.	At the 6 August NSC meeting, the President commented on the Daniel proposals, saying he thought we should support the French proposals only under the following conditions (see Tab "B", Brief of NSC Meeting, 6 August.):
a.	Ve must get the French to commit themselves publicly to a program which will insure the support and cooperation of the native Indochinese. The later increments of our
14 h

increased aid should be provided only if the French have made real progress in giving the natives greater independence.
b.	If we are to give greatly increased support, the French mustlnvite our close military advice in the conduct of the war in Indochina.
c.	The French should give us renewed assurances regarding passage of the EDC.
d.	He, the President, would not propose to call Congress back for an extra session to vote any additional funds for Indochina.
e.	We might invite Daniel to visit the United States and be prepared to make a conditional committment regarding further support for Indochina operations.
5.	Action on this matter was somewhat delayed by the general strikes in France, but on 1 September the State Department received further, more detailed information from the French (paragraph 7 below), and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the French program, which is based on the "Navarre Plan" described to General O'Daniel when he visithd Indochina some months ago. The JCS state (see Tab "C"),
Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, 28 August 1953)•
a.	"... a basic requirement for military success in Indochina is one of creating a political climate in that country which will provide thc incentive for natives to support the French and supply them with adequate intelligence which is vital to the successful conduct of operations ... If this is accomplished and the Navarre concent is vigorously pursued militarily in Indochina and given wholehearted political support in France, it does offer a promise of military success sufficient to warrant appropriate additional U.S. aid required to assist."
b.	That information from Indochina indicates the French are not pursuing agreements reached between General 0’Daniel and General Navarre as vigorously as expeeted. (Even more recent information from Saigon indicates some slight Improvement, however,)
c.	In light of the French slowness in following up
the Navarre concept, addition?.! U.S. support "should be conditioned upon continued implementation of French support, demonstration of French intent by actual performance in Indochina, and continued French willingness to receive and act upon U.S. military advice."
145

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
6.	On Friday, 4 September, at the joint State - JCS meeting, the JCS further stated they believed the necessary financial support should be granted, conditioned upon the French assurance of expanded effort. They felt this financial support should not be doled out in a bargaining fashi >n but should be made available, with such savings as possible, for the stated purposes, we should leave the French no loophole in this regard to consider that we were showing lack of intent to support the Indochina operation and hence give them an excuse for insufficient action.
7.	On 1 September, the French presented to the United States a memorandum, in answer to the U.S. questionnaires, which gave fairly detailed information on their programs. This memorandum states that even if France’s financial situation requires a reduction of her military budget, the French government nevertheless intends to carry out General Navarre's recommendations, and implementation has already began. Complete execution remains subject, however, to U.S. aid amounting to $385 million up to the end of 1954. It goes on to say: " In the event this aid could not be granted, a complete reconsideration of the plan of operations in I dochina would be unavoidable." The memo then gives further information on plans and requirements. The French have indicated 9 additional infantry battalions of French Union forces cna be in Indochina by 1 November, that they are increasing the build-up of the native forces, that they are offering independence to the Associated States and that they will remove "colonial-minded" French officials.
8.	The FOA has considered the legality of providing the funds required to meet the French program. They state that by use of the President’s potters to transfer funds within "Titles" of the MSP Act, plus miney already appropriated for additional support for Indochina, the requirements can be met. However, this may require a transfer of up to $285 million from "Itle I", the NATO area, and we have not yet fully worked out what the impact of this transfer would be on NATO programs and on "offshore procurement" in the NATO area.
9.	Mr. Dulles, at the NATO Council meeting in April of this year told the NATO countries he expected offshore procurement contracts in Europe during our fiscal year 1954 to amount to $1.5 billion, subject to appropriations by Contress. This was important for helping meet the European balance of payments. Congress seriously cut appropriations, and the transfer to Dldoehina of an additional $285 million from available funds will fprther reduce opportunitics for offshore procurement in Europe (although some of the Indochina funds may be expended in France for OS?). However, the military services have been reviewing world-wide overall MDAP end-item programs during the past month against the foreign military units, in being or clearly to be created, which vrou1d recieve the end-items. This review is scheduled to be complete in about a week, but very rough preliminary indications seem to show up lessened requirements to meet priority programs due to slowness in the creation of
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
COFf
foreign military units. Therefore, in a very tentative way, it seems that the transfer of $285 million from NATO requirements to Indochina will not have a disastrously bad impact on NATO. It would be highly desirable to complete this review before acting finally on the Indochina proposal, in order to permit a better understanding of the impact on NATO and how to deal with it, but delay is not essential if the urgency of acting.in Indochina is great enough in the eyes of the Secretary of State.
10.	FOA points out the high desirability of consulting with Congressional leaders concerning the Executive’s intention to provide additional aid to Indochina. The hearings on this year’s MSA programs brought out Congressional worries over the degree of U.S. involvement in financial support for Indochina. Such consultation, which we hear may be undertaken by the President himself, will require some time and may thus permit the better evaluation of the impact of the proposals on NATO and offshore procurement (per paragraph 9 above).
11.	It is not yet known precisely what the State Department will recommend to the NSC for consideration. (Mr. Dulles is taking this matter up with the President and is not expected back in washington until late on Monday, September 7). However, they may recommend NSC approval in principle for the provision of aid required to meet the French request, subject to:
a.	French agreement to the following conditions:
(1)	French to make every effort to achieve the elimination of. the regular enemy forces.
(2)	French to promptly increase native and French Union forces in Indochina, and agree to carry on thc campaign under the Navarre concept.
(3)	French to continue to pursue policy of generously and freely negotiating with the Associated States re their independence.
(4)	French to welcome continuing exchange of information and views with U.S. military, especially re intelligence and training.
(5)	The Indochina program will not entail any basic or permanent alteration of France’s NATO plans and programs
(6)	End-item assistance required will be agreed upon in Saigon.
Declassified per Executive Order 13526. Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
COPY
(7)	Not to exceed $385 million will be all the US. will provide for "mutual defense financing" up to 1 January 1955, realizing that additional funds may be needed thereafter. (Source of the $385 million need not be disclosed to French but it may be desirable to make certain savings in FY 54 end item programs for France and Indo-China.)
(8)	Any savings accruing from more detailed planning and
screening will reduce the U.S. aid required.
(Note that the President's suggestion re EDC is
left out of the above. This is because opponents of either program may join forces in the French Assembly to defeat the Indo-China program. However, it should be made clear to French that failure to include ratification of EDC as a condition of aid does not indicate that our assumption that she will ratify has changed in any respect.)
b.	Consultation with Congressional leaders.
c.	Aid agreement with French will be reduced to clear written detail in a classified Note or Aide Memoire to avoid the frequent and divisive controversies surrounding this subject in the past.
RECOMENDATIONS:
* r
12.	It is recommended that you:
a.	Ask for full discussion of the impact of the transfer
of funds from aid to NATO on NATO force levels and offshore procurement, and the likely political results on the other NATO government. (Mr. Dulles, Mr. Stassen and Admiral Radford may comment thereon.)
b.	Ask if the Secretary of State believed it essential for the NSC to act in principle at this meeting:
If the Secretary of State replies that the NSC should act at once, then we recommend you approve the proposal in principle to be followed by the immediate conduct of through discussions with appropriate Congressional leaders and subject to French acceptance of the conditions listed in paragraph 11 a, above.

If the Secretary of State believes it is possible to delay action until a later meeting, we recommend you suggest this be done so that you may give the NSC a better evaluation of the impact of the proposal on NATO and offshore procurement before the NSC takes final action.
p. That you agree with the State Department in not conditioning U.S. support for this Indochina program with French ratification of the EDC •

PARIS, 29 September 1953
My dear Mr. Ambassador:
With reference to the exchange of views which has taken place during recent weeks between the Government of the United States and the Government of the French Republic concerning the additional aid necessary for the financing of the military operations in Indochina, I have the honor to confirm to your Excellency the Informa-tion contained in the memorandum of September 3, 1953 of the French Government vihich indicated the plans, programs and policies of the French Government for the intensified prosecution of the war against the Vietminh by the forces of France, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
At the moment vthen the Government of the United States is considering the possibility of such additional aid, I consider it equally useful to state briefly the intentions of the French GoVernment as follows:
1.	France is firmly resolved to apply fully its declaration of July 3, 1953, by which it announced its intention of perfecting the independence of the three Associated States of Indo-China.
2.	In the View of the French Government, the purpose of the addditional aid in question is to enable it to put into effect the strategic and tactical principles of a military action program in Indo-China, the terms and timing of v;hich are set forth in Annex No. 4 of the memorandum of September 3. As outlined in the aforementioned document, the strategic plan of the French Command consists essentially of retaking the offensive with a View to breaking up and destroying the

regular enemy forces. ConVinced that the military problem in Indo-China can be settled only in conformity with such a plan, the French Government confirms that it intends to carry forward vigorously and promptly the execution thereof. In accordance with the basic strategic concepts of the Navarre Plan, the French Government ’has already commenced to build up the Associated States forces and is proceeding to despatch French reinforcements to General Navarre.
3.	The French Government will continue to facilitate exchanges of information and views on a continuing basis between French and United States military , authorities and will take into consideration the Views expressed by the latter with respect to the deVelopment and carrying out of the French strategic plans without in any way, of course, detracting from exclusiVe French responsibility for adoption and execution thereof.
4.	The French GoVernment is prepared to proVide to the United States GoVernment all appropriate information regarding the type and amount of expenditures necessitated by the military program.
5.	The French GoVernment considers that the increased effort which it intends to make in Indo-China under the conditions set fortli in the memorandtun of September 3 will not entail any basic or permanent alteration of its plans and programs concerning those of its forces which are placed under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The amount of this aid is $1,070 million, made up as follows:
(a)	$11-85 million of assistance from United States fiscal year 1953/54- appropriations, composed of $4-00 million for Indo-China and 085 million for French forces under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

(c)	$367.5 million of defense support aid from United States fiscal year 1952/53 appropriations. The franc resources to be realized from this latter amount of aid Will, of course, be net of the 10 percent counterpart set aside for the use of the United States Government. This net amount is calculated at &330»75 million. Thus when counterpart withdrawals for military purposes from the Special Account of the Credit National in the tvzo calendar years 1953 and 1954- taken together exceed the franq equivalent of O330»75 million computed at the rate of exchange at Which the counterpart is deposited, additional accruals during the calendar year l95h will be counted as a part of the amount of 135 billion francs of additional assistance described in this letter.

Although Department hones and believes that statesmanlike action and utterances of Rao.Dai, Tam on one hand and Laniel, Bidault on other will prevent damage from becoming irreparable, Department believes essential find ’’ays revitalize concept mutuality of interest between Trance and Vietnam. Your continuing views and comments would be appreciated.

Failure of Congress to express anpreciation of efforts and sacrifices of 300,000 Vietnamese fighting Viet Minh apnearS even more extraordinary than failure to exnress similar sentiments regarding essential French sacrifices and effort. Bao Dai statements have helped but insufficiently.
Mutuality of interest in outcome of struggle is major present factor which needs emphasis and Department confident everything possible being done Saigon and Paris.
In addition however there is nroblcm of reconstruction which will arise when war is won P'-RET if it is lost, neither French nor we will have any such problem S’DPAREN. That problcm will include necessity for providing reconstruction of country devastated by eight years of war, restoration of communic?'tions and reintegration into national life of several hundred thousand soldiers.

for the security of the regime and the USSR, , especially in the face of a hostile coalition,' I of distrust of U. S. aims and intentions, and of । long-established reliance on. techniques of con-| spiracy and subversion. Accordingly, ths basic SoViet objectives continue to be consolidation and expansion of their otn sphere of poner and the eVentual domination of the non-communist world.
b. Soviet strategy has been flexible and Will probably continue so, allowing for retreats and delays a.s Well as advances. The various ’•peace gestures” SO far haVe cost the Soviets very little in actual ccncessions and could be merely designed to divide the West by raising false hcpes and seeking to make the United States appear unyielding. It is possible, hoWever, that the USSR, for internal and Other reasons, may desire a settlement of specific issues or a relaxation of tensions and military preparations for a substantial pariod. * Thus far, there are nO conVincing signs Of readiness tO make important concessions to this end.
h. a. Thc capability of the USSR to attack the United States with atomic weapOns has been continuously growing and Will be materially enhanced by hydrogen weapons. The USSR has sufficient bombs and aircrafts using one-way missions, toI inflict serious damage on the United States, I especially by surprise attack. The USSR seen /may have the capability of dealing a crippling iblow to our industrial base and our continued ability to prosecute a war. Effective defense could reduce the likelihood and intensity of a hostile attack but not eliminate the chance of a crippling blow.
b.	The USSR not; de Votes about one-sixth of its gross national product to military outlays and is expected to continue this leyel. It has and wilt, continue to haVe large conventional military forces capable of aggress5.on against countries of the free world. Within tha next two years, the Soviet bloo is not expected tO increase the size Of its forces, but Will strengthen them With improved equipment and training and the larger atomic stockpile.

c.	The SoViet bloc now has the capability of strong defense against air attack on critical targets Within the USSR under favorable weather •
I conditions, and is likely to continue to ’ strengthen its all-weather air defenses.
I 5. The Decent uprisings in East Germany and the unrest in other European satellites evidence the failure of the SoViets fully to subjugate these peoples or to destroy their desire for freedom; the dependence of those satellite goVernments on Soviet armed forces; and the relative unreliability of satellite armed forces (especially if popular resistance in the satellites should increase). These events necessarily have placed internal and psychological strains upon the Soviet leadership. Nevertheless, the ability of the USSR to exercise effectiVe control over, and to exploit the resources of, the European satellites _ has not been appreciably reduced and is not likely . to be so long as the USSR maintains
adequate military forces in the area. .
b.	The detachment of any major European satellite from the SoViet bloc does not now appear feasible except by SOViet acquiescence or by war. Such a detachment would not decisiVely affect the SoViet military capability either in deliVery of vzeapons of mass destruction or in cOnventional forces, but would be a considerable blow to Soviet prestige and would impair in some degree SoViet conventional military capabilities in Europe.
c.	The Chinese Communist regime is firmly in control and is unlikely to be shaken in the foreseeable future by domestic forces or riVal
• regimes, short of the occurrence of a major War. The alliance between the regimes of Communist China and the USSR is based on common ideology . and current community of interests. With the death of Stalin and the Korean truce, Communist China may tend more to emphasize its own

military manpower to the SoViet bloc.
6.	a. The USSR does not seem likely deliberately to launch a general War against the United States during the period covered by	.
current estimates (through mid-1955). The	y
uncertain prospects for Soviet Victory in a general war, the change in leadership, satellite unrest, and the U, Se capability to retaliate massively, make Such a course improbable.
Similarly} an attack on NATO countries or other areas which would be almost certain to bring on general War in view of U. S, commitments or intentions Would be unlikely. The SoViets Will not, hoy,'ever, be deterred by fear of general war from taking the measures they consider necessary to counter Western actions Which they vievz as a serious threat to their security.
b€ When both the USSR anil the United States reach a stage of atomicplenty and ample means of deliVery. each will have the probable capacity to inflict critical damage on	.
the other, but is not likely to bo able tO prevent major atomic retaliations. This could create a stalemate, With both sides reluctant to initiate general warfare5 although if the SoViets believed that initial surprise held the prospect of destroying tho capacity for retaliation, they might be tempted into attacking.
c.	Although SoViet fear of atomic reaction	✓
should still inhibit local aggression, increasing SOViet atomic capability may tend to diminish the deterrent effect of U„ So atomic power against peripheral Soviet aggression. It may also sharpen the reaction of the USSR to What it considers proVocatiVe acts of the United States, If. either side should miscalculate the strength of the other’s reaction, such local conflicts could groW into general War, eVen though neither seeks nor desires it. To avoid thiss it Will in general be desirable for the United States tO make clear to the USSR the kind of actions Which Will be almost certain to lead to this result, recognizing, hovever, that as genera.!

7.	Ths USSR Will continue tc rely heavily on tactics of diVision and subversion to Weaken ths free world alliances and Will to resist the Soviet pover. Using both the .fear of atomic warfare and the hope of. peace 5 such political warfare will seek tO exploit differences among members of the free WOinld, neutralist attitudes, and anti^colonial and nationalist sent!-merits' in underdeVeloped areas. For these purposes, communist parties and other ccoperating elements Will ba u&ed to manipulate opinion and control- goVernments whereyer possible. This aspect Of the SoViet threat is likely to continue indefinitely and to grow in intensity.
8.	OVer time, chan; s in the outloOk and policies of the leadership of the USSR may result from such factors as the slackening of revolutionary zeal, the growth of Vested managerial and bureaucratic interests, and popular pressures for consumption goods. Such changes, combined With the growing strength of the free world and the failure to break its cohesion9 and pOSsible aggravatiOn Of weaknesses Within the SOViet blcc threugh U, S. or allied action Or other*-wise, might induce a willingness to negotiate. The Soviet leadership might find it desirable and even essential to reach agreements acceptable tO ths United States and its allies, vithnut necessarily abandoning its basic hostility to the nen-Soviet world.

b.	Certain other countries, such as IndoChina or Formosa, are of such strategic importance to the United States that an attack on them probably would compal the United States to react with military force either locally at .the point of attack or generally against tha ■military poWer of the aggressor.

The chances for such . disarmament would perhaps be improved by agree« ments on other conflicts either beforehand or at x	the same time, or by possible realization by the
SoViets, in time, that armament limitation will serve their ovn interests and security.

b.	In Western Europe the build-up of military strength and the progress of economic recovery has, at least partially, remedied a.situation of glaring weakness in a vital area. NATO and associated forces are now sufficient to make aggressive action in Europe costly for the USSR and to create a greater feeling of confidence and security among the Western European peoples. HowsVer, even though significant progress has been made in building up these forces, the military strength in Western Europe is presently not sufficient to prevent a full-scale Soviet attack from oVerrunning Western Europe. Even With the availability of those German forces presently planned Within the frame*" Work of EDC, present rates of defense spending by European Nations and present rates of U. S. Military Assistance certainly could not be expected te prcduce forces adequate to preVent the initial .loss cf a considerable portion Of the territory of Western Europe in thc eVent of a full-scale SoViet attack. Therefore, since U. S. Military Assistance muat eventually be reduced, it is essential that the Western European states, including West Germany, build and maintain maximum cfeasible defensiVe strength. The major deterrent tO aggression against Western Europa is the manifest determination of the United States to use its atomic capability and massive’retaliatory
pstriking power if the area is attacked. How-eVer f> the presence of U. S. forces in Western Europe makes a contribution other than military to the strength and cohesion of the free World coalition.
c.	In the Far East, the military strength < ■	of the ccalition now rests largely on U. S.
military power plus that of France in Indochina, the UK in Malaya and Hong Kong, and the in-
'	digeaous forces of the Republic of Korea, Viet-
nam, and Nationalist China. Any material increase Will require the revival of the economic and military strength Of Japan.

16. V/hile the coalitonn is founded on common interest and remains basically sound, 'certain factors tend to weaken its cohesion and to slow down the necessary build-up of strength.
। a. Soma of these factors are inherent in thc nature of a coalition led by one strong ’ power. The economic and military recovery by ■ our NATO allies from their lot; point of a few years ago, and the reViVal of Germany and Japan, has giVen them a greater sense of independence from U. S. guidance and direction. Specific sources of irritation are trade with the SoViet bloc, the level of the defense effort, use of bases and other facilities, and the prospect of discontinuance of U, S. economic aid Without a corresponding change in U. S. trade policies.
• b. The coalition also suffers from certain other Weaknesses and dilemmas. A major weakness is the instability of the gOVernments of certain NATO partners, such as Italy and France. The colonial issue in Asia and Africa, for example, has not only weakened our European allies but has left those areas in a state of ferment Which weakens the whole fx*ee World. Efforts by the United States to encourage orderly settlements tend to leave both sides dissatisfied and to create friction within the alliance. Age-old issues such as divide France and Germany, or Italy and Yugoslavia, still impede creation of a solid basis of cooperation against the SoViet threat.	.
c.	Moreover, allied opinion, especially in Europc, has become less Willing to follow U. S. leadership. Many Europeans fear that American policies, particularly in the Far East, may involVe Europe in general War, or . will indefinitely prolong cold-war tensions.
Many consider U. S. attitudes toward the SoViets as too rigid and unyielding and, at the same time, as unstable; holding risks ranging from ' preventive war and "liberation” to Withdrawal ; into isolation. Many consider that these * policies fail to reflect the perspective and confidence expected in the leadership of a great nation, and reflect too great a preoccupation With anti-communism. Important

sectOrs Of allied opinion are also concerned oVer deVelopments within the United States which seem tc them inconsistent With our assumed role of leader in the cause cf freedom. These allied attitudes materially impair cooperation and, if not Overcome, could imperil the coalition.
d.	Fear of What a genaral war will mean fcr them is deeply rooted and Widespread among our
• t allies. They tend tO see the actual danger of SoViet aggression as less imminent than the United States dees, and some haVe a fatalistic . feeling that if it is coming they vzill not be able to do much about it. In the NATO countries, many have serious doubts Whether the defense requirements can be met Without intolerable political and ecOnomic strains. Certain of our allies fear the rearmament of Garmany and Japan on any large scale, and in Germany and Ja«.pan themselves strong currents of opinion oppose it as unnecessary or dangerous. Moreover, in certain ccuntries, particularly France and Italy, graye domestic problems haVe called into question not only the authority of the goVernments, but. also the basic foreign policies and alignments Which they have followed. All these factors lead tO allied pressure in faVOr of new major efforts to negotiate With the USSR, as the Only hepe of ending the present tenSion, fear and frustration. This pressure has increased With recent "peace gestures” of the naw SoViet leadership, which has made every endeaVor to exploit it. Whether these hopes are illusory or well-founded, they must
\ be taken into consideration by the United States.
The Uncommitted Areac of the World
17.	Despite the Soviet threat, many nations and societies outside the SOViet blcc} mostly in the underdeveloped areas, are so unsure cf their national interests, cr so preoccupied with other pressing problems, that they are presently unwilling to align themselves actively With the United States and its allies. A3.though largely undeveloped5 their vast manpOwer, their essential raw materials and their potential for growth are such that their abserptiOn within the SoViet system would greatly, perhaps decisively, alter the world balance cf power to evr detriment. Conversely, their orderly development into more stable and responsible nations, able and willing to participate in defense of the .free World, can increasingly add to its strength.

29.	a. The national security programs of the United States rest upon the manpower to operate them, the economy to produce the material for them, and the financial resources to pay for them.
b.	The qualified manpower annually coming of military age is adequate to carry out our . .	existing military programs. HoveVer, the con-
tinuing development of more complicated Weapons, machines, and deVices used by the military
. .	greatly increases the need for military man-
"	power possessed of higher skills, and for
their better utilization, and emphasizes the
■	need for expanded technical training and re-
tention of technically trained personnel.
c.	Any considerable increase in the need for military manpower Would require consideration of:

In doing so, to aVoid seriously weakening the Uc S, economy or undermining our fundamental Values and institutions.
Nature of the_ Soviet,,Threat
32o.	a. With increasing atomic, power. the SoViets haVe a mounting capability of inflicting Very serious and possibly crippling damage on the United States. The USSR will also continue to haVe large military forces capable of aggressiVe action against countries of the free v/orld.
Present estimates are, hovzever, that the USSR Will not deliberately initiate general war during the next seVeral years, although gen-	•
oral War might result from miscalculation. In _ the absence of general war, a prolonged period of tension may ensue, during which each side increases its armaments, reaches atomic plenty and seeks to improve its relative power position.
b. In any case, the Soviets Will continue to seek to diVide ana Weaken the free world coalition, to absorb or Win the allegiance of the presently tmcomm.itted areas of the World, and to isolate the United States, using cold war tactics and the communist apparatus. Their capacity for political Warfare against the United States as well as its allies will be enhanced by their increased atomic capability.
33« S.” A sound, strong, and growing U. S» economy is necessary to support oVer the long pull a satisfactory posture cf defense in the \ free World and a U. Se capability rapidly and effectively to change to full mobilization. The ’ United States Should not Weaken its capacity for high productivity for defense? its free institutions, and the incentives on vzhich its long-term economic growth depends.

a.	The risk of Soviet aggression Will be minimized by maintaining a strong security posture, with emphasis on adequate offensive retaliatory. strength and defensive strength. This must be based on massive atomic capability, including necessary bases; an .integrated and ef-fect.i.Ve continental defense system; ready forces of the United States and its allies suitably deployed and adequate, to deter or initially to counter aggression, and to discharge required \ initial tasks in the event of a general war; and an adequate.mobilization base; all supported by the determined spirit of the U. S. people,
b.	This strong security posture must also be supported by an effective U, S. intelligence system, an-' adequate manpower program, superior scientific research and development, a program of limited defense mobilization, reasonable
•	internal security, and an informed American
people.
.	c. Such a strong security posture is es-
. ■	sential to counter the SoViet divisive tactics
and hold together the coalition. If our allies „	were uncertain about our ability or will to
counter Soviet aggression, they Would be strongly tempted to adopt a neutralist posi-

• d. To enhance the capacity of free World nations for self-support and defense, and to reduce progressively their need for Uc So aid, the United States should assist in stimulating international trade, freer access to markets and ra.W materials, and the healthy growth of underdeveloped areas.

economy is essential to the security and stability of the free World, In the interest cf both the United States'and its allies, it is vital that the support of defense expenditures should not
,	seriously impair the basic soundness of the U. S.
economy by undermining incentives or by inflation.
b.	The United States must, however, meet the necessary costs of the policies essential for its security. The actual leVel of such costs cannot be estimated until further study, but should be kept to the minimum consistent with the carrying out of these policies.
c.	Barring basic change in the world situation, the Federal Government should continue to make a determined effort to bring its total annual expenditures into balance, or into substantial balance with its total annul revenues and should maintain over-all credit and fiscal policies designed to assist in stabilizing the economy.
d.	Every effort should be made to eliminate waste, duplication, and unnecessary OVerhead in tho Federal GoVernment, and to minimize Federal expenditures for programs that are not essential to the national, security.
e.	The United States should seek to maintain a higher and expanding rate of economic activity at relatively stable price levels.	.
f.	The economic potential of private enterprise should be maximized by minimizing ■ ’	governmental controls and regulations, and by
,	encouraging private enterprise to deVelop

c.	The willingness of the SoViet leadership to negotiate acceptable settlements, without necessarily abandoning hostility to the non-SoVlet world,may tend to increase OVer time, if the United States and its allies deVelop and increase their own strength, determination and cohesion, maintain retaliatory power sufficient to insure unacceptable damage to the SoViet system should the USSR resort to general War, and prove that the free World can prosper despite SoViet pressures, or if for any reason SoViet stability and influence are reduced.

Laniel asks me to assure you and the President that Ho Chi Minh interview Will not (repeat not), of itself, and certainly not (repeat not) pending full consultation at Bermuda, be pcrrcittcd to affect in any way Indochina policy which he has followed since he became Primo Minister. Hc .and Vidal consider intcrvicw 98 pcrccnt propaganda and recognize that it has already had great effect both in Franco and Indochina and will make continuation of their policy considerably more difficult. Laniel is nevertheless confident thnt hc can keep his governments support without going further in direction of negotiations than he did in his November 24 statement (Embassy’s telegram 20^9, November 29). Hcdid not (repeat not), speculate ns to wheat situation might bo under another govt mment in January. Navarre has reported belief that in six months hc should bo able to achieve major improvement in militmy situation, including particularly cleaning up south. I reminded them of very long timc which had elapsed between first hint and actual opening of Korean truce negotiations and of importance to any eventual negotiations of first obtaining best possible military position.
As indicative of pressure hcrc Vidal subsequently told me that President Au Idol had summoned Inuicl at 3:00 this morning and told him to consult representatives of three. Associated States immediately with view to seeking earliest possible opening of negotiations with representatives of Ho Chi Minh. Lanielhad flatly refused and said that he had no (repeat no), intention of changing his policy, at least until he had consulted US and UK at Bcrmuda and then Associated States.
Despitc Daniels unquestioned sinceri ty on this, his November 21; statemcnt left considcrcble latitude for negotiations and we , must remember both thc very heavy pressure which the Ho interview will unquestionably stimulate and the fact that Laniel government must constitutionally resign in mid-January,

\3o With rospoct to thc Ground Forces, I again wish to omphsoiso tho following point:.
Formulation of allocations of equipment based upon tho regular tables of equipnont of tho Anorican Army (which are known to be inuufficlont in Indochina) will bring about tho reduction of tho nv ’bcr of units for which activation uao anticipated<> It will bring about ths neglect of all thc territorial ground installations for organic units, not authorized in tho tables of equipment® Those ground installations aro, however, essential to the implanted units in viou of their Mission of "pacification”® It will bring about a handicap to tho Ground Forccs in tho dual mission thoy havo to ac-complinh: destruction of tho robots1 Battle Corps and "pacification"o

■ ASSUMPTIONS1
For both a. and b. above:
1.	No Chinese Communist intervention in force in Indochina had taken place.
2.	Commitment of US forces had been publicly requested by the French and Vietnamese governments.
3.	At the time of the US commitment French Union forces still retained essentially their present position in the Tonkin Delta.
4.	Communist
would have
China and the USSR prior knowledge of the
US intent to commit its forces in Indochina.
5.	Following the US commitment, there would be a phased withdrawal of French forces from Indochina.
6.	The US will warn the Chinese Com-munists that if they openly inter-vene2 in the fighting in Indochina, the US will not limit its military action to Indochina. '
ESTIMATE
1. We believe that the Communists would assume that the purpose of committing US forces in Indochina was the decisive defeat of the Viet Minh. Consequently, we believe that Communist reactions to such a US commit-mcnt would be substantially the same whether
it were designed to dcfcat the Viet Minh with US forces (Problem a.) or eventually with US-trained Vietnam forces (Problem b.).
‘The Problem and the Assumptions have been provided to the Intelligence community as a basis for the estimate.
’For the purposes of this estimate, open interven-tion Is defined as the commitment of substantial Chinese Communist combat forces, under any gulse.
ln the Event of a Pending US Commitment 2. We do not believe that Communist China, upon learning of a forthcoming commitment by the US, would immediately intervene open-ly with substantial forces in Indochina. The acceptance by Communist China of an armi-sticc in Korea, its policics to date with respect • to Indochina, and its present emphasis on

domestic problems seem to indicate a desire at this time to avoid open intervention in the Indochina war or expansion of thc conflict to Communist China. US warnings against Chi-nese Communist intervention in force 3 proba-bly would have a strong deterrent efl'ect. Moreover, the political advantage to be gained by portraying the US as an “aggressor” would probably appear both to Communist China and thc USSR to outweigh the military advan-tage of moving large Chinese Communist forces into Indochina before the arrival of US forces.
3.	In addition, Communist leadership would probably estimate that they would have time to take a number of steps which, without a serious risk of expanding the war to China, might deter a US military commitment or seri-ously impair its effectiveness. Such steps might incIude:
a.	Increasing logistic and rear area support to the Viet Minh.
b.	Covertly committing Chinese troops to operate as “Viet Minh guerrillas.”
c.	Encouraging intensified Viet Minh guer-rilla and sabotage operations in Indochina, particularly in and around the Tonkin Delta, designed to inflict such damage on the French Union position as to increase the difficulties of the US operation.
d.	Building up Chinese Communist strength in south China, including Hainan.
e.	Seeking by diplomatic and propaganda means in thc UN and elsewhere to forestall US action, to gain the support of non-Communist countries, and to exploit differences between the US and its allies over preparations for this operation.
•Such warnings would reinforce the warning al-ready given by Secretary of State Dulles, in his American Legion Speech at St. Louis, 2 Septem-bcr 1.953:
“Communist China has been and now is train-ing, equipping and supplying the Communist forces in Indochina. There is the risk that, as
. in Korea, Red China might send its own army Into Indochina. The Chinese Communfst re-gime should realize that such a second aggres-sion could not occur without grave conse-quenees which might not be confined in Indo-china. I say this soberly in the Interest of peace and in the hope of preventing another aggressor miscalculation."
f.	Concluding a defense pact with the Viet Minh.
Although, in response to a US military com-mi tment in Indochina, the Communists might threaten to renew hostilities in Korea, we be-lieve that they would not actually take such action as they probably estimate that re-newed aggression in Korea would result in expanding the conflict to Communist China itself.
Actual US Commitment
4.	In the initial stages of an actual US mili-tary commitment, the Communists might not feel compeHed to intervene openly in force immediately. They would recognize the difficulties which the US forces would face in oper-ating in the Indochina climate and terrain. They would also realize that thc xenophobia of the indigenous population of Indochina might be effectively exploited to thc disadvan-tage of US forces by Communist propaganda; the Chinese Communists would therefore pre-fer that thc US rather than themselves be confronted with this antiforeign attitude. They might estimate that, with increased aid from Communist China, the Viet Minh forces, by employing harassing and infiltrating tactics and avoiding major engagements, could make any US advance at the least slow and difficult. It is probable, therefore, that the Chinese Communists would initially follow a cautious military policy while they assessed the scale, nature, and probable success of the US action, the effect of such action on Vietnamese na-tional morale and military capabilities, the subsequent military and political moves of the French, the temper of US opinion, the reactions of US allies and the neutralist states, and the position of the UN. Even at this early stage, however, the Chinese Communists would probably take strong actions short of open intervention in an effort to prevent thc US from destroying the Viet Minh armed forces.4
'The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State, believes that the timing of the Com-munlst reaction to the commitment of US forces in Indochina cannot be estimated with any de-gree of assurance. He therefore believes that a decision by .the Communists to follow a cautious policy in the initial stages of the US action should be presented as a possibility, rather than
• as a probability.

5.	In addition to the steps outlined in paragraph 3 above, thc Chinese Communists, at this earIy stage of US commitment, would probably provide an increased number of military advisors, possibly including commanders for major Viet Minh units. Moreover, Peiping might covertly furnish limited air support for Viet Minh ground forces, but would be unlikely to undertake air operations which it esti-mated'would provoke US retaliation against Communist China itself other than retaliation ■ against those airfields from which such air attacks werc launched.
6.	If the leaders of Communist China and the USSR came to bclieve that a protracted stalemate in Indochina was likely, they would probably not openly commit Chinese Communist ground, naval, or air forces to an intervention in force in Indochina, nor would they renew hostilities in Korea or commit new acts of armed aggression elsewhere in the Far East. Peiping and Moscow would probably believe that a long and indecisive war in Indochina could be exploited politically and that, in time, US and Vietnamese will to fight might be worn down.
7.	If at any time, however, the leaders of Communist China and the USSR canto to believe that a decisive defeat of the Viet Minh armed forces was likely, they would be faced with the decision whether Communist China should intervene openly in force in order to avert this development.
8.	The following considerations might induce the Communists to decide in favor of open intervention in force:
a.	Dccisivc defeat, of the Viet Minh armed forces would be a grave blow to Communist prestige throughout the world and would seriously diminish prospects for the expansion of Communism in Asia.
b.	A US military commitment in Indochina might form part of a larger plan, possibly involving, in the minds of thc Communists, thc resurgence of Chinese Nationalist strength, aimed at the destruction of the Chinese Communist regime. In any case, decisive defeat of the Viet Minh armed forces would bring US power to the borders of Chlna.
c.	Whatever the initial intention, succcss-ful US military action in Indochina might encourage the US to increase pressure on other points of the Communist periphery.
d.	Many observers, particularly in thc Asian neutralist states, would consider the US in thc wrong in Indochina and would condone Clii-nese Communist intervention as a move to “liberate Indochina from American imperialism.” These sentiments could be effectively exploited by Communist propaganda.
e.	The US, despite its warnings, might not retaliate strongly against Communist China, bccause it would fear that such retaliation would alienate its NATO allies, result in wider military deployment of US forccs, cause Pciping to invoke the Sino-Soviet treaty, and thereby increase the danger of general war.
f.	By intervening openly in force the Chinese Communists might be able to'prevent in-definitcly both the successful accomplishment of the ITS mission and the disengagement of substantial US forces from IndcchinS.
9.	On the other hand, thc following considerations might deter the Communists from deciding to intervene openly in force:
a.	It- would be more important to concentrate upon domestic problems including strengthening of Communist China’s economy.
b.	There would be a grave risk of US reprisals against Communist China and possibly of gcneral war,
c.	Indochina is remote from the LTSSR and the centers of power in Communist China. Accordingly, thc establishment of a strong US position in Indochina would not constitute, to the same degree as in Korea, a threat, to Chinese Communist and Soviet power in the Fat-Easi. •
d.	Short of actual intervention, the Chinese Communists could acquire a position of strength by reinforcing and rehabilitating the military facilities on Hainan. This position would dominate the Gulf of Tonkin, and pose a distinct threat to sea-air lines of communications of US forces in Indochina and to rear bases.

e.	The loss in prestige involved in the de-feat of the Viet Minh armed forces could in part be offset by depicting the Viet Minh as an indigenous liberation movement. Moreover, the Viet Minh Government and its armed forces could be preserved on Chinese soil where they could exercise constant military and political pressure on the .forces of the. US and the Associated States.
f.	The military and political nature of the Indochina war is such that even if the US defeated the Viet Minh field forces, guerrilla action could probably be continued indefinite-ly and preclude the establishment of complete non-Communist control over that area.
g.	Under such circumstances, the US might have to maintain a military commitment in Indochina for years to come. Heavy US corn-mitments in Indochina over the long run might cause concern to US allies and might create divergences between the US and neu-tralist states.
10.	The Director of Central Intelligence and the Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, believe that the Communist reaction to commitment of US forces in Indochina would largely depend upon US posture prior to, and at the same time of, such commitment. If the US posture made manifest to the Communists that US naval and air retaliatory power would be fully applied to Communist China, then Pciping and Moscow would seek to avoid courses of action which would bring about such retaliation. In_such circumstances, the chances are better than even that the Chinese. Communists would not openly intervene in Indochina, even if they believed that failure to intervene would mean the defeat at that time of the Viet Minh field forces in Indochina. Therefore the Director of Central Intelligence and the Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, believe that in weighing the arguments set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 Chinese Communist leaders, in such circumstances, would estimate that it was more advantageous to them to support a guerrilla action in Indochina and tie down large US forces in such a war, than to risk US retaliatory action against China itself which open intervention would involve. However, the Communists would al-most certainly continue to support the rem-
nants of the Viet Minh, including re-equipping ' these remnant forces on the Chinese side of thc border and possibly augmenting them with Chinese "volunteers’’ so that Viet Minh resistance could be continued indefinitely. Moreover, they would pursue their objectives in the rest of Southeast Asia by all means short of open military intervention.
11.	The Special Assistant, Intelligence, De-partment of State, thc Director of Naval Intel-ligence, the Assistant Chief of Stall, G-2, Intelligence, Department of the Army, and thc Director of Intelligence, USAF, believe that the condition of “decisive defeat of the field forces of the Vict Minh” prescribed for con-sidering this problem would necessarily result in such a serious setback to Communist pres-tige, security, and expansionism as to lead to the following conclusions. In weighing the arguments presented in paragraphs 8 and 9, the Communist leaders in both Peiping and Moscow would probably give greatest consideration to: (a) the loss of prestige, the threat to Bloc security, and the setback to Communist expansionism in Southeast Asia involved in a decisive defeat of the Viet Minh armed forces and, (b) the risk of direct US action against Communist China. To the Communists, the consequences of the decisive defeat of the Vict Minh armed forccs would be both certain and far reaching. In appraising the possible nature and scale of direct US action against the China mainland, the Communists would weigh any US warn-ings of probable consequences of intervention, the temper of US and free world opinion, and the probable US desire not to expand a local action. It is unlikely that the Communists’ ' appraisal would lead them to the conviction that the US reaction to their intervention in Indochina would take the form of extensive and intense warfare against Communist China. In any case, their overriding sus-picion of the ultimate motive of US forces in strength on or near the borders of Communist China would strongly influence their courses of action. Thus, the thought foremost in their minds would most probably be that failure to dislodge US military forccs from the Chinese border would lead to increasing chal-lenges to Communist power elsewhere.

therefore believe that thc chances are prob-.ably better than even' that the'Cdmmunists and that the
