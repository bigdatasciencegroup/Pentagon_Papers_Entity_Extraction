50.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend steps which the U. S. might take to assist in achieving success of the Navarre Plan. Among these steps are: a renewed emphasis by France on support of the Navarre Plan; an assignment of additional specialists to MAAG, Indochina; an increase in unconventional warfare activities; a re-examination of current national strategy; and an interim revision of French KATO commitments. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 15 January 1954........................................
51.	The President approves the statement of policy in NSC 177, ' "United States Objectives and Courses of Action with Respect to Southeast Asia," which views the loss of Indochina as having "most serious repercussions on U.S. and free world interests....'1 (NSC 177 was renumbered as NSC 5405) NSC 5405, 16 January 1954................................
52.	Senator Stennis informs Secretary Wilson that the U. S. should stop short of sending troops or airmen to Indochina. "I do not think we can at all afford to take chances on becoming participants in Indochina." Stennis letter to Secretary of Defense, 29 January 1954....................
53-	The President's Special Committee decides to recommend action on certain urgent French requests for twnety-two B-26 aircraft and two hundred Air Force mechanics for Indochina, and to await-General 0'Daniel’s return before deciding on other requests. It is generally agreed that the importance to the U.S. of winning in Indochina could, lead to intervention by U.S. air and naval forces -- but "not ground forces." ISA Memorandum for the Record, 30 January 1954....................................................
54.	The President approves, and the CJCS notifies France of U. S. transfer to Indochina of ten B-26 type aircraft and. two--hundred USAF mechanics. This brings to twenty-two the total of B-2o aircraft slated for delivery to Indochina. Admiral Radford (Anderson) Memorandum to Genera] Valluy, 30 January 1954.....................................
55-	General 0'Daniel reports on General Navarre’s lack of enthusiasm on having a U. S. "liaison officer" and his
. disinterest in U. S. participation in psychological warfare. O'Daniel recommends that a small Joint Staff be approved, additional funds to STEM be approved, and the employment of liaison officers be approved. He comments that Dien Bien Phu can withstand any kind of Viet Minh attack, but would be untenable to a force that had several battalions of artillery with air observation.

The JCS express concern over developments in the status of the MAAG Chief to Indochina relative to a considerable increase in personnel and scope of training responsibilities. The French feel that "it should be clearly under-. stood that neither O'Daniel nor MAAG-was to have any powers, advisory or otherwise" in planning operations or training the national armies. The JCS feels a demotion of O’Daniel in deference to Navarre is detrimental to U. S. prestige. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 5 March 1954...............................................

62.	Admiral Radford shares doubts of other JCS members on the adequacy of measures taken by General Navarre at Dien Bien , Phu. General Ely predicts the outcome at Dien Bien Phu as "50-50" and emphasizes the great political importance of the battle. Radford is "gravely fearful" that French measures will be inadequate, the consequences could lead to loss of Southeast Asia, and to avoid this, the U. S. must be "prepared to act promptly and in force" to a belated French request for intervention. See Annex B to Document 63, page ?77. JCS Memorandum for the President,

63.	General Ely, Chairman of tile French Chiefs of Staff, is "unsympathetic" to the JCS view to expand MAAG, Indochina to assist in training Vietnamese. Ely feels it would encroach on French responsibilities, would'affect "prestige" and shows lack of confidence in French leadership.

64.	The U. S. reiterates to the U. K. the following assumed- . position: (1) that Britain supports our agreement to discuss Indochina at Geneva provided Fremce would not turn over the area to the Communists; and (2) "we shall not, however, be disposed to give Communist China what it wants from us merely' to buy its promises of future good behavior." Dulles 5090 to London, 1 April 1954................ 291
65.	The U. S. proposes a coalition of U. S., France, Associated States, U. K., Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and
the Philippines, which would fight in Indochina as an alternative to French Union surrender and as a position of strength going to Geneva. Dulles 3476 to Paris, 3 April 1954................................................ 1	293

68.	NSC Action Ko. 1O74-A considers the problem of determining the circumstances, conditions, and extent to which the U.S.
, should commit its resources to save Indochina. The problem involves foul' issues: (1) the prospect of loss of Indochina; (2) the risks, requirements, and consequences of intervention; (3) desirability and fom of U. S. inter- • vention; and (4) the timing and circumstances of inter-	. ■
vention. NSC Action lOyh-A, 5 April 1954........................ 298
69.	The U. S. Army position on intervention in Indochina cites . the military disadvantages of such action. Specifically, the Army views are that air and naval forces alone cannot assure victory; that atomic weapons do not reduce the number of ground troops required; that at least seven U. S. divisions with air and naval support are required to win • if the French withdraw and the Chinese do not intervene; and that the equivalent of twelve U. S. divisions are re-quircd if the Chinese intervene. Army Position on NSC Action No. 1O74-A (undated)..........................................33’2
70.	The President’s Special Committee studies the problem to	•
secure the defeat of Communism and establish a "Western oriented complex" in Southeast Asia without resort to	.
overt combat operations by U. S. forces. The report recotnmends implementation of courses of action previously recommended by the JCS (i.e., augment the French Air Force, assign CIA officials to Indochina, and allocate additional funds to Indochina); and that selective political, military, and psychological steps be taken as a matter of priority (i.e., expand MAAG, expand use of U.S. covert assets in unconventional warfare field, develop foreign information campaign, etc.).

71.	The President’s Special Committee submits recommendations concerning longer range policy and courses of action for possible future contingencies in Southeast Asia not covered, by NSC 5405. It is recommended that the U. S. accept nothing short of military victory, oppose a nego-
•	tiated settlement at Geneva, pressure the Associated
States to continue the War with U. S. support even if
• . negotiations succeed, and seek participation of other nations. Regardless of the outcome of current operations in Indochina, the U. S. in all prudence should develop a regional defense posture incorporating all thd Southeast Asian states.

"U. S. is doing everything possible....to prepare public, Congressional, and constitutional basis for united action in Indochina." However, such action is considered "impossible" except on a coalition basis with British Commonwealth participation.

France feels that the time for formulating coalitions has passed as the fate of Indochina will be decided.in the next ten days at Dien Bien Phu. Dillon (Paris) 3729 to Dulles, •5 April 1954................................................. 360
The National Security Council receives recommendations of the Planning Board on NSC Action 1074-A. The Board recommends that the U. S. intervene if necessary but continue to pressure the French and to support a regional defense grouping in Southeast Asia with maximum Asian participation. The NSC also receives an assessment of risks in	.
intervention and alternative policies. NSC 192d Meeting .	’
(Item 1), 6 April 1954........................................ 361
Eden.feels the seriousness of the French military situation is exaggerated — "French cannot lose the war between	.•
now and the coming of the rainy season however badly they may conduct it." London 4382 to Dulles, 6 April 1954.......... 3°°
Dulles emphasizes that unless a new clement is interjected into Indochina situation, such as an ad hoc coalition of nations prepared, to fight, the French will "sell-out" at Geneva. The U. K., Australia, and New Zealand attitude is the key to "united action" and it is believed, that Red China would not intervene. Dulles 163 to Canberra, 6 April 1954.................................................. 367
The MaIbney mission, which reviewed the Indochina cost study with the U. S. Country Team in Saigon, concludes that "it is not possible...to arrive at any reasonable estimate of cost" to the U. S. of materials for the Indochina war. The "crash requirements" and the French impression (from visiting U. S. officials) that all requests will be granted has kept the 1DAP program in a "constant state of flux."

Should Communist China intervene in Indochina with combat aircraft, the.Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that talks should be initiated to provide for implementation of military actions as outlined in NSC 5405. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 8 April 1954................. 378 .

79« It is noted by the NSC Planning Board that france has had the loan of U. S. carrier "Belleau Wood" for nearly a year without use in the Indochina war. Further, the French "urgent requests" for U. S. aircraft appear contradictory in light of1 the sale of "Ouragon" jets to India and use of the "Belleau Wood" as a "delivery wagon." General Bonesteel Memorandum for Robert Cutler, Presidential Assistant,
10 April 1954......................•.........................   380
80.	In view of the NSC actions on 6 April (192d Meeting)and subsequent Presidential approval, the Secretary of Defense directs the JCS to "promptly prepare the military plans" for the contingency of intervention at Dien Bien Phu. He also notes that the Presidential directed the State Department to concentrate its efforts prior to Geneva on organizing a regional grouping for the defense of Southeast Asia. Secretary of Defense Memorandum to the Secretaries and JCS, 15 April 1954.....................................................   382
81.	The Department of Defense indicates concern over the lack of U. S. policy and pressures the State Department to come up with a U. S. position for the Indochina" phase of the Geneva Conference. The Defense version of a draft position recommends a positive and definite stance that U. S. objectives in Southeast Asia not be compromised and that if France does not accept this position the U. S. should not participate at Geneva. Defense Foreign Military Affairs Letter to U. Alexis Johnson, ’Coordinator of	•

85.	Dulles and Eden exchange frank end heated words over the British pressuring France for a cease-fire. The U. S. indicates that the tripartite position is poor, i.e., . •	not "very impressive or cohesive" and that "the other
side" was worried — but not about Britain. The U. S.
is also concerned over the affects on NATO, EDC and the entire defense structure in Europe. DULTE 13, 27 April 1954........................................................    395
86.	Dulles makes an estimate of rapidly moving developments: (1) when Dien Bien Phu falls, the French Government will change, probably to the left, committed to liquidate China. A withdrawal of forces to defensible enclaves under U.S. protection with subsequent U.S. training of native armies is considered. Open intervention at this point would be answered by Chinese intervention, (2) U.K.
•	attitude is one of increasing weakness, (3) "the decline
of France, the great weakness of Italy, and the considerable weakness of England create a situation where...we must be prepared to take the leadership...." DULTE 21, 29 April 1954..............................•..................  397
87.	In the event of a cease-fire in Indochina, the JCS	•
recommend that shipment of U. S. military aid under MDAF be immediately suspended and the entire program of aid to Indochina be re-examined. JCS Memorandum
for the Secretary of Defense, .30 April 1954................... 399
88.	The Intelligence Advisory Committee concludes that the fall of Dien Bien Phu would have far-reaching and adverse repercussions, but would not signal the collapse of the French Union political and military situation in Indochina, nor would it substantially alter relative military capabilities of French and Viet Minh forces. The French Union could retain control of the cities though there would be a serious decline in the Vietnamese will to continue the war.

89.	Major General Thomas J. H. Trapnell, former Chief of MAAG, Indochina comments in his debriefing on the French situation in Indochina. His comments cover in detail the strategic position of Indochina, the government and its prosecution of the war, the performance of MDAP sup. ported forces, the objectives of the opposing forces, ■ the organization and tactics of both the French and
Viet Minh forces. In Trapnell's view, few of the aims of the Navarre concept ate progressing satisfactorily. "Dien Bien Phu is not only another Na San, but a grave

tactical and strategic error." On the political aspects of the war, Trapnell feels that "a strictly military solution to the war in Indochina is not possible...It is doubtful if the ordinary people understand the issues at stake between the rebel and Associated States objectives." The solution in Indochina requires a strong French assault on the Viet Minh, training of National armies, a defensive alliance of Asian nations, and a guarantee of the Associated States borders. Trapnell recommends a U.S. training mission for Indochina, and concludes that victory in Indochina is international rather than local and essentially political as well as military. Major General Trapnell Debriefing,
3 May 1954..........................5......................... 406
90.	Indochina is the only nation that has the highest MDAP priority and thus has precedence over every other nation for allocation of .critical military equipment. The JCS have completed a plan for military intervention in Indochina and, as well, planned for resumption of hostilities in Korea. CINCPAC has directed that other plans be prepared, i.e., blockade of China coast, evacuation of French forces from Tonkin, etc. Joint Su'osidiary Plans Memorandum for OCB, 5 May 1954............................... 421
91.	General Smith reviews the French proposal which has been sent to the Cabinet for approval. France proposes a cease-fire take place when "international" control machinery, based on Daniel’s 5 March conditions, is in place. Regular troops would be regrouped into delimited areas and all other forces disarmed. France assumes that the Russians would propose a follow-on political settlement (coalition) end immediate elections. SECTO 106, 5 May 1954......................................................... 423
92.	The NSC<195th Meeting considers Secretary Dulles pessimistic report on Geneva to the President: (1) there is no responsible French Government to deal with, (2) the British reject the "regional grouping," (3) the British want secret talks on Southeast Asia, (4) the expected communist proposal is for foreign troop withdrawal and elections, (5) and the U.K. wants a settlement based on partition. ESC 195th Meeting, 6 May 1954........................... 425
93« Dulles briefs Congressional leaders on the Geneva Conference and reviews the weaknesses of Britain’s position. Congress members comments are adverse. Dulles states three conclusions: (1) U.S. should not intervene mili-
_ tarily, (2) U.S. must push rapidly for a Southeast Asia
' community, (3) and the U.S. should, not "write off" the
British and French in spite of their weakness in Asia.	•

94. The JCS forward their views on negotiations with respect to Indochina to the Secretary of Defense for transmittal to the Department of State in regard to SECTO 106. The JCS feel that, based on the Korean experience, and as a minimum, the U.S. should not "associate itself with any French proposal directed toward a cease-fire ‘in advance of a. satisfactory political settlement." JCS Memorandum to Secretary of Defense, 7 May 1954...............................
95• President Eisenhower makes it clear that the preconditions for U.S. intervention in Indochina are that the "U.S. would never intervene alone, that the indigenous people must invite intervention, and that there must be regional or collective action. The NSC action of the meeting on 5 April as pertains to paragraph l.b. of the record (organizing a regional grouping) is approved by the President. Memorandum by R.

96.	May 8 - July 21: Geneva Conference on Indochina. The 1st Plenary Session convenes on 8 May and hears proposals by France and the Viet Minh for cessation of hostilities and participation in the conference. ’(Excerpts) The 'delegates to the conference are from Great Britain and the USSR (joint chairmen), France, the United States, Communist China, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and the Viet Minh regime. (Final agreements are signed on July 20 and 21, and the main provisions concerning Vietnam are that (1.) Vietnam is to be partitioned along the 17th parallel into North and South Vietnam, (2) regulations are imposed on foreign military bases and personnel End on increased armaments, (3) countrywide elections, leading to the reunification of North and South Vietnam, are to be held by July..20, 1956, and (4) an International Control Commission (ICC) is to be established to supervise the implementation of the agreements. The United States and Vietnam are not signatories to the agreements. The United States issues a unilateral declaration stating that it (1) "will refrain from the threat or the use of force to disturb" the Geneva agreements, (2) "would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the aforesaid agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security," and (3) "shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections, supervised by the UN to insure that they are conducted fairly."’) Excerpts from 1st Plenary Session of the Geneva Conference, 3 May 1954..............................

97.	The Defense member of the NSC Planning Board indicates the options available to the U.S. with regard to the . Geneva results. General Bonesteel suggests that the increased risks associated with pressuring France to continue the war and possible U.S. intervention to stop the communist advance can "more surely and safely be accepted • now than ever again." On the other hand, a compromise at Geneva would lead to communist subversion at a late date and U.S. involvement then might be inhibited by an increased Soviet nuclear capability. "Asia could thus be lost." General Bonesteel Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 9 May 1954................................................ 442
98.	The draft instructions for the Geneva Delegation, which have been approved by the President are sent to the Defense Department for comment. According to the instructions, the U.S. is "an interested nation which, however, is neither a belligerent nor a principal in the negotiation." State Department Letter to R. B.

100.	The United States "posture" at Geneva is interpretcd as "to cheer the players" rather than "to pitch." The draft instructions to the Geneva delegation imply a "profound point" -- will the U.S. admit diplomatic defeat and cease to use the conference toward its ends if the conference appears to go against the U.S.? General Bonesteel Memorandum for Deputy Secretary of DefensM 10 May 1954................................................ 449
101.	The President approves informing the French of his conditions for U.S. intervention in Indochina. Even though premature, the decision to internationalize the war must be made. President Eisenhower would ask Congressional authority to commit U.S. forces provided: (1) there was a French request, (2) that other nations would be requested and would accept, (3) that the UN would be notified, (4) that France guarantees independence in the French Union to the Associated States, including the option to withdraw at any time, (5) that France would not withdraw its forces after the intervention, and (6) that an agreed on structure for united action is reached.

103.	Secretary Dulles forwards the basic instructions approved by the President for the head of the U.S. Delegation to Geneva. "The United States is not prepared to give its express or implied approval to any cease-fire, armistice, or other settlement...." which would, subvert the local governments, impair territorial integrity, or jeopardize forces of the French Union.

104.	A proposal tabled at the Planning Board meeting on
13 May 1954, suggests that "the U.S. is endeavoring to avoid the loss of Indochina and to resolve the colonialism problem by the creation of a regional grouping." General Bonesteel Memorandum to NSC, 13 May 1954................................................ 460
105.	Lani el and Schuman appear well pleased with the U.S.
position, especially that U.K. participation is no longer a prerequisite to U.S. intervention. The one	.
serious objection to Eisenhower's conditions, however, is that "France publicly accord to the Associated States the right of withdrawal from the French Union at any time." Unless some way can be found around this, "the French will never ask for outside assis-	_
tance." Paris 4383 to Dulles, 14 May 1954..................... 462
t
106.	In referring to the French objection to Eisenhower’s conditions for intervention, Dulles indicates the U.S. might be flexible but "there cannot be any equivocation on the'completeness of independence if we are to get the Philippines and Thailand to associate themselves." Without them the whole arrangement would collapse and the U.S. is not prepared to intervene "as part of a white Western coalition which is shunned by all Asian states." Dulles 4094 (TEDUL 73) to Paris, 15 May 1954............... 465
107.	The "right of withdrawal" from the French Union is unacceptable to France because it reflects on French honor and questions the concept of the French Union. It is proposed that existence of a powerful Vietnamese National Army would clarify the independence status to other Asian states and therefore the U.S. should assume "primary responsibility for the training and equipping of a Vietnamese National Army.*" Dillon 4402 to Dulles,

The JCS recommend against a "Korea-type" defense of Southeast Asia as unsound. Accordingly, the U.S. "should adopt the concept of offensive actions against the ’military power of the aggressor,' (in this instance, Communist China) rather than local reaction to the attack. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 May 1954....................................... 4dO
General Smith cannot understand why the JCS down-graded U.S. military representation on the five-	i

The JCS point out their belief that, from the U.S. point of view with reference to the Far East,"Indochina is devoid of decisive military objectives and allocation of more than token U.S. armed forces in Indochina would be a serious diversion of limited U.S. capabilities." '

115-	The white House views the JCS position on intervention in Indochina as not involving any new policy issue relative to NSC 5405- However, a pencilled Secretary of Defense marginal note indicates that the White House "misses the point" -- the JCS was considering the "regional grouping" and others in the grouping, i.e., U.K. may object to NSC 5405 policy. Hence the JCS is warning "not to get involved in such a grouping" unless all parties accept direct action. White House Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 26 May 1954......................... 494

Ely emphasizes particular points to Trapnell and Dillon: (1) Ely was not in accord with 0’Daniel's proposal to reorganize the Vietnamese army on a divisional basis, (2) 0'Daniel's operational war plan was unrealistic, (3) the increasing frequency of American criticism of French conduct of the war was not appreciated, (4) Ely was regrouping his forces for defense of the Delta, and (5) one or two U.S. Marine divisions could assure	.

Both the dangers of partition and impossibility of armistice supervision in Tndochina are recognized. "There is very little that the Defense Department can do to influence the negotiations, since a political decision has been made that the U.S. will continue to participate" even though partition will ultimately result in loss of Indochina to communism.

121.	There is no misunderstanding between U.S. and France if U.S. policy on a Chinese intervention would be "judged under the circumstances of the moment." Dillon cites • three courses of action open to the U.S. in such an event: (1) President will request Congress to act, (2) President would request authority to use forces, or (3) U.S. would act only as part of a collective action.

123.	Disagreement exists that the U.S. and France have "now reached accord in principal on the political side" on conditions for U.S. participation in Indochina. The U.S. needs a precise statement of France's commitments _	to meet the preconditions for intervention. Dulles 4421

Dulles feels that it is of "overriding importance" to push on with action on Thailand's appeal to the United Nations Security Council, TOSEC 368, 7 June 1954............... 533
The U.S. ..will seek firm views of others once the "French authoritively tell us they want to internationalize the Indochina war." Further, when France decides to request U.S. intervention, the U.S. must have the opportunity to make its own decision based on prevailing circumstances. "We cannot grant the French an indefinite option on us without regard to intervening deterioration." TEDUL 175, 8 June 1954..................................................   540
Because of Thailand's strong feeling the scope of appeal	.
should not be limited to Thailand. The Thai government has a negative attitude on limiting the scope and they object to Czechoslovakia or other Soviet satellite membership on the Peace Observation Commission (POC).

Bidault replies to a conversation reported in DULTE 156 (not printed here) in which "agreement in principle" with the U.S. had been reached. No major differences are noted, however, French military believe any JCS war plan would show the necessity of at least one Marine division for the Delta. General Valluy's ’conversationsat the . Pentagon are seen as most crucial. "Thus if we want French military assistance... in. Southeast Asia...it is vital, tJCS...approve a joint war plan justifying the
use of Marines." Paris 4766 to Dulles, 9 June 1954............. 544

133.	"General Ely has twice in my presence stated that his keenest desire is for the United States to enter this war." The purpose of General Valluy's statement (war assessment) is either to bring the U.S. and five other powers into the conflict or to prepare an "excuse before history" for an armistice. Saigon 2714 to Dulles, 10 June 1954....................................................     552
134.	The French military feel that a Tonkin decision will rest on U.S. intentions. The French are reluctant to request "internationalization" which would result in new talks and provoke new "hopes." The U.S., on the other hand, •	does not want to consider a U.S. training mission separate
from the "overall operational plan" on the assumption the conditions are fulfilled for U.S. participation in Indochina. Murphy (Acting SecState) 4503 to Paris, 10 June 1954........................................................... 553
135.	The French impression is that even after all conditions are met, the chances of U.S. participation are "nil." With this attitude it is only a matter of time until the French ccme to terms with the Viet Minh. The result would be disastrous to French public opinion and the "U.S. would be blamed" for having failed in the crisis. Therefore, it is recommended that the French be informed • that "the President is no longer prepared to request military intervention" even if France fulfills all conditions. France should strive for an armistice and thus avoid a ..military disaster. A few months delay in communist takeover in Indochina is not commensurate with "possible collapse of the defense of Western Europe." Paris 4341 to Dulles, 14 June 1954................................... 555

the date of expiry of ouf option is fast running out." TEDUL 197, 14 June 1954...........■............................ 558
137.	Secretary Dulles emphasizes that events have shown that predictions he has made all along on the lack bf any real French desire for U.S. intervention but "as a card to play at Geneva."

165.	President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles indicate firmly to President Mendes-France the rationale behind not sending Dulles or General Smith back to Geneva.

I.	In response to the adion taken by the Na+ionaI Seourity CoundI (NSC) on 8 January 1954 on MSC 177, the Joint Chiefs of Staff reoommend for your Consideration the adions shown hereafter, Appendix "B" of whioh was prepared in Consultation with the Centra I Intelligenoe Agenoy (CIA), to assist in aohieving the suCCess of the Navarre PI an.
2.	The aotions are Considered to be feasibIe within the framework of existing nations I poIicies and wiI I not invoIve the overt use of U.S. forCes in Combat. However, in view of the continuing Changes in the military situation in Indochina, together with ihelr infIuenoe on existing nationaI poIitiCo-miIitary poIides and Commitments in other areas, the aotions shouId be reviewed and re-evaIuated on a Continuing basis.

Discussion: The FrenCh government is under strong and inoreasing domestio pressure to reduoe the FrenCh miIitary commitment in IndoChina. FrenCh nationaI sensitivity Continues—partiCuIarIy upon points of prestige. AIthough General Navarre has adopted many of the reCommendations of Lieutenant GeneraI John W. O'Daniel, USA, other reCommendations pertaining to training, tactics, strategy, and Iogistios have not yet been fulIy impIemenied. In some Cases the reasons for this laok of Cooperation may be poIitiCaI in nature, and therefore beyond GeneraI Navarre’s oontroI. In summary,, a renewed effort to obtain fuII support of the Navarre PIan and U.S. measures to support it, induding those hereafter reCommended, is essentia I.
W ApproaCh the FrenCh with a proposaI to organize a voIun-teer air group Composed of personnel from various anti-Communist nations or groups to serve with the FrenCh Union forCes in Indoohina as outlined in Appendix "A."
DisCussion: This examination was directed by the President at the NSC meeting of 8 January 1954. WhiIe the President emphasized partid pat ion by U.S. voIunteer personne! he a I so mentioned the ino I us ion of other nations Is. Sinoe this is a definitive means by whiCh the FrenCh can inCrease the Indoohinese air effort as desired by them and thereby inCrease their over-all air CapabiIlty this step is militar-iIy desirabIe. Its feasibiIity is Iimi+ed onIy by the provision of suffioient U.S. funds.
£. Assign additions I teChnioa! spedaIis+s to MAAG, I ndo-China, in aCoordanoe with the reCommendations of the November O'Daniel report, so as to maximize teChniCaI assistanoe to the FrenCh Union forCes.
DisCussion: Additional techniCal advisory personneI are needed for MAAG, IndoChina, to provide guidanoe and training to the Frenoh.
p. ConviriCe the Frenoh miIitary authorities that it is imperative to inCrease unConventionaI warfare activities as suggested in Appendix "B," the subs+anoe of whiCh is a broad gen-eraI Conoept, for the use of guerriIIas and Can be used as the basis for disCussions between General O'Daniel and authorities in Indoohina in order to appropriately influenoe the FrenCh.
Discussion: .The present French unConventionaI warfare effort in IndoChina is Considered to be reIativeIy ineffec-+ i ve.

e. Re-examine current national strategy with respect to Indochina, taking advantage of any unifying forces existing in Southeast Asia as a whole in opposition to the spread of Soviet Communism, and treating Southeast Asia as a unit with due regard to the long term objectives of the U.S. and France in the area. For further discussion, see Appendix "C."
Discussion: The Soviet Communist campaign in Southeast Asia is waged on a regional and coordinated scale, rather than separate attacks on individual countries. By forming new coalitions of western oriented countries, certain opportunities can be expected to open up which will directly support operations in Indochina.
P. Increase the pace and scope of the U.S. information program, and the U.S. advisory activities in furtherance of the French and Associated States military psychological warfare effort in accordance with the recommendations of the senior U.S. officers on the ground. (See Appendix "D"). Consideration should be given to both unilateral action and action in conjunction with colonial French military and civil authorities, as well as indigenous leaders of Southeast Asia. The objectives should be to increase:
(1)	The willingness of the pcople of France and the U.S. to support the prosecution of the war.
(2)	The anti-Communist attitudes and active participation of the native populations.
(3)	The morale of the French forces in Indochina.
i
Discussion: To secure the maximum benefits of our program of assistance to Indochina and, simultaneously, Southeast Asia by the cumulative and cooperative efforts of all propaganda media at the disposal of the Allies.
£. To rendcr maximum and expeditious assistance in providing materiel and training to the French and Associated States Forces engaged in the Indochina war, the Services should be directed to accomplish (1) and (4) below and authorized to accomplish (2) and (3) below:
(1)	Expedite shipment of undelivered items on FY 50-54 Programs in accordance with priority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for deliveries of MDAP.	*
(2)	Make changes in current programs as requested by Chief, MAAG, Indochina, and make deliveries against such changes and, if deemed necessary, without prior reference to or approval of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
214
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

(3)	Increase monetary value of FY 54 MDA Programs for Indochina, as may be necessary and feasible to provide additional materiel and/or training requested by Chief, MAAG, Indochina.
(4)	Undertake the implementation of these instructions through such organizations and by such procedures as are considered necessary to insure prompt and effective response to valid requests for assistance..
Discussion: To date, restrictive criteria and procedures have seriously handicapped the administration of MDAP assistance in the support of the effort in Indochina. MDAP assistance is normally used to support a training and re-equipment program. In Indochina, however, such equipment is being used to support an active campaign. The purpose of the above is to free the Services of all restrictive criteria other than final legal limitation of available funds in order that prompt and effective response may be achieved in meeting all valid requests received from Chief, MAAG, Indochina.
R. Give consideration to interim revision of French NATO commitments in Europe in ordcr to allow provision of additional French air personnel to Indochina.
Discussion: Shortage of air personnel has been one major factor in prolonging the war. A reappraisal of French NATO commitments should be considered with a view toward releasing additional French air personnel for Indochina.
i.	Insure that personnel assigned to MAAG, Indochina, are qualified, to advise the French Union forces on U.S. tactics and techniques.
Discussion: This would provide the benefit of U.S. battle experience for use in Indochina.
T- Consideration should be given at Governmental level to the proposition of declarations as follows:
(1)	By France: A declaration of intention to prosecute the war in Indochina to a successful conclusion and looking toward the more complete independence of the Associated States of Indochina.
215
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
(2)	By the United States: A declaration to the effect that positive action will be taken to prevent the conquest of Indochina by aggression originating outside of Indochina.
Discussion: A declaration of intent, as outlined above, would in gencral raise the morale of all peoples in South-
east Asia and in particular would increase the determina-
tion of the Indochinese to fight the war to a successful conclusion.

2. The danger of* an overt military attack against Southeast Asia is inherent in the existence of a hostile and aggre.SS5.VG CemmUnist China. The use of U.

3» HOWever, overt Chinese Communist attack on. any part of Southeast Aaia is less probable than continued comraunist efforts to achieve domination through armed rebellion or subVersion. By far the most urgent threat to Southeast Asia arises from the Strong possibility that eVen Without overt Chinese Communist intervention the situation in Indochina may deteriorate anew as a result of weakening of the resOlve of France and tha Associated States of Indochina to continue to oppose the Viet Minh rebellion, the military strength.of Which is increased by virtue of aid furnished >
by the Chinese Communist and SoViet regimes. Barring overt Chinese Comunist intervention or further serious detsriora*’ t5-on in Indochina, the outlOok in Burma, Thailand, and Malaya offers opportunities for some improvement in internal stability and in the control of indigenous communist forces.

5* Since 1951 the United States has greatly increased all forms of assistance to the French in Indochina, particularly military aid, and has consulted contiuous.ly with France With a View to assuring effect!Ve use of this aid. Partly as a result of these efforts, French resumption of the initiative . under ths 'ManielMIavarrO Plan” has checked at least temper-’ _• arily deterioration of the French will to continue the struggle. Concurrently the French have moved tovard perfecting the independence of the Associated States Within the French Union. In September 1953 hhe United States decided to extend an additional 3385 milliOn in aid, in return for a number of strong French assurances., including a commitment . f that the French Would vigorously carry ferward the "Laniel-Navarre Plan”, With the object Of eliminating regular enemy forces in Indochinaj and cn the understanding that if the ’’LanielvJIavarre Plan" Were not executed, the United States would retain the right to terminate this additional z	.

Honorable Charles E. Wilson
Secretary of Defense
Washington, D» Co
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have boon impressed for some time that we have been steadily moving closer and closer to participation in the uar in Irzlo-Ohinae I am not objecting to any announced policy thus f:r, but a decision must soon bo mode as to how far we shall go, I foul that you will be highly influential in formulating this important poli.cyo	'	.
It seems to mo that t;o should certainly stop short of sending our troops or airmen to this area, either for participation in the conflict or as instmctors© As altrays, when we send onegroup, ve shall have to send another to protect the first and we shall thus bo fully involved in a short time© ‘
With consideration of our confirmed promises and assumed obligations in Europe, in the Pacific area, in Korea and elsaahcro, and With consideration of cur homo defenses, I do not think ua can at all afford to take chances on becoming participants in Indo-Chinn,	.
' Further, I have understood that the Air Force has a special request to send twenty-five to fifty civilian airplane mechanics to Indo-Chiha* It seems to me that almost the sama reasons apply in this instancco Franco has a great abundance of such mechanics, I an sure, as I saw many French mechanics last Soptember at our military installation at Chateauroux engaged in overhauling jet engines.
I appreciate the fine contribution your arc making ,.o our national Welfare as Secretary of Defense and as a menibcr of the Security Council,, I shall appreciatc your consideration of this important, far-reaching question.
With best wishes, I am

INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS I
MEMORADLM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting of President’s Special Committee or. Indochina, 29 January 1954
1.	The Special Cci-mitteo i.et in Mr* Kyes1 office at 3:30 p.m.
29 January 1954-	.
2.	The first matter discussed was the disposition of urgent French requests for additional U.S. assistance. The Under Secretary of State, General W. B. Smith, mentioned, that there has as yet been no reply to Prime Minister Daniel’s letter to President Eisenhower on this subject. It was necessary to answer this substantively as soon as possible.
.	3. Admiral Radford, said he had been in touch with General Ely,
French Chief qf Staff, through General Valluy. Ten B-2> aircraft are on the way to Indochina this weok. These would contribute to filling too French request for aircraft to bring two B-2o squadrons up to a strength of 25 operational aircraft each. However, an additional 12 are reefed, to fill the full requircment because a total of 22 are needed (12 to fill the annual attrition plus 10 to fill the additional French request). There was some discussion on the seeming differences in requests reaching Washington via Paris and those.coming through the MAAG. Subsequently in the meetirg it was agreed that the French should be informed, that the U.S. would act only on requests which had beer approved by General O'D.tnicl after General 0'Daniel was set up in Indochina.
z
4.	Admiral Radford indicated that to fill the entire requirement for 22 B-2j's on an urgent basis would mean taking sone of the;;, from U.S. operational squadrons in the Far East, but this could bo clone. The aircraft would not all have "zero" maintenance time on them.
5.	As to the additional French request for 25 B-2o’s to equip a third squadron, it was decided, tilat final decision to furnish them should await the return of General O'Daniel. However, the Air Force has been, alerted, that they may leave to co furnished on short notice.
6.	As to the provision of a small "dilipible", it was decided to in-fom the Frer.ch that this could, not be fui’itisnec.

7.	Regarding the French request for hCO mechar.ics trained, in the maintenance of B-20 ard C-4? aircraft, there was cor.sic.era.blo discussion. Admiral Radford said he had inferred General Ely, through Conoral Valluy, . that the U.S. does not celieve the French have exhausted all efforts to got French civilian me.intenauce crows. He suggested, the French try to find the..: through "Air Francs.” Hr. Kyes mentioned the possibility of obtaining French persor.nd from their eight aircraft factories or from the big Chateauroux naiiterance base whore the U.S. employed French mechanics. General Smith inquired about the possibility of lowering French NATO co: a tit; tents to enable transfer of French military L:ecne.nics. Admiral Redford said Gor.eral Valluy had infort-ed him the Frer.ch Staff have cc.refully considered the idea but the French Air Force does not have enough military mechanics trained, in B-2o or C-47 rn.iuteiawce to fill the requirement. Therefore, there would be such a delay while their military mechanics were being trained on these aircraft that the urgent recuiveaeut could not be met. Kc had also said tilat the c tnloynont of French civilian mechanics presented a difficult problem in security clearance.
8.	General Smith recommended that the U.S. send 200 U.S. Air Force •» mechanics to HAAG, Indochina, and toll .the French to provide the rest. Admiral Radford, said this could be done and that the Air Force is, somewhat reluctantly, making plains to this end. He had let the French know that if American mechanics were sent they must be used only on air be.ses which werc entirely secure from capture. General Smith wonderc-cl, in light of additional French requests, if the Committee should not consider sending the full 403 mechanics.	,
9« Mr. Kyss questioned if sending 200 military mechanics would rot so coa-lit the U.S. to support the French that we must be prepared eventually for complete intervention, including use of U.S. combat forces. General Smith said he did rot thirl: this would result - we were sending matntenar.ee forces not ground forces. Ke felt, however, that the importance of winning in Indochina was so great that if worst came to ths worst ho personally would favolyintervewtioh with U.S. air and naval forces - not ground forces. Admiral Rad.ford agreed.. Mr. Kyes felt this consideration 3tas so i mportant that it should be put to the highest level. Ths President himselt should decide. General Smith agreed. Mr. Allan Dulles wondered if our preoccupation with helping io win the battle at Dien Dien Ph.u was so great ti-at we were not going to bargain with the French as ire supplied their most u-t nt needs. Hr. Kyes said this was an aspect of the question he was raising. Admiral Radford read, from a cable just received, fro-* General C’D-.riel which indicated. General Navarre had been r.oit cordial to General G’Danie?. at their meeting and h?.d indicated, he was pleased. with the concept of U.S. liaison officers 'being assignee, to his general headquarters aacl to the training ccu-rmd. General irrarre and General 0’Daniel agreed, to try to work out a -nwimu-i'of collaboration at the military level.
10.	later in the meeting, Mr- rAllen Dulles raised, the question as tq sreoin.g the CAP ni'.cts the French.. l—d once rerueoted. It vas	t-'. >t

help in training. It was agreed that General O'Daniel should probably .be first assigned. as Chief of 1-AAG and that, for this reason, General Dabney's departure for Tndochi::a should be temporarily held up. General Dabney should., however, go to Indochina to assist General 0'Daniel by heading up the present HAAG functions. Admiral Davis was requested to assure that General Dabney did not depart until further instructions were given.	.
14.	There was some discussion, initiated by 10. Kyes, about trays by which t?.e French Foreign Izagion in Indochina might-bo augmented.. He felt that if the C-oraan aid French Goveratcents would facilitate it, considerable lur.mers of Gcrtans night be enlisted to increase the Legion. Mr. Kyes mentioned, several other general courses of action he thought should, be further considered by the Special Co—nittae and then suggested that General Erskine read his yanor on the subject of Indochina. Mr. Kyes i made it plain he considered, this paper only a point of departure for ■ further work by the Special Committee. General Erskine then read the paper, copies of which were given to the members of the Special Committee.
15* Admiral Radford said he thought, in general, that the paper covered many important fields but he had one or two reservations. He felt, with regard to the recommendation on regional coordination, that CIIICPAC was, and should be, the man to head up regional coordination of the MAAGs. Mr. Kyes re it era. ted that the paper was only a point of departure and said he felt the basic trouble, in trying to help in Indochina was the attitude of the French Government. Mr. Allan Dulles said the French do not want us to become too involved in the conduct of operations in Indochina because they want to keep one foot on the negotiations stool
16.	/Admiral Radford said he felt the paper was too restrictive in that it was premised on U.S. action short of the contribution of U.S. combat forces. He said that the U.S. could not afford to let the Viet Minh take the Tonkin Delta. If this were lost, Indochina would be lost and the rest of Southeast Asia would fall. The psychological imp et of such a loss would, be unacceptable to the U.S. Indochina must have ths highest possible priority in U.S. attention. He suggested. the paper, when redrafted, saoilld. have two parts, one based on no interventi 1 tri th combat forces and. a second part indicating what should be done to prepare against the contingency where U.S. combat forces would be needed. General Smith was generally agreeable to this approach.
17.	It was agreed not to use the COD facilities to support the Special Co:—-ttee, but instead. to set up a working group of representatives of the principals of'the Specici Committee to revise General Erskine’s paper by the middle of the tree’:, 31 January - 6 February.

19.	At the close of the meeting, General Smith inquired as to what was being done to speed up the delivery of spare parts for B-2o’s and C-ll9’s. He was informed. that necessary action had been taken.
20.	Nr. Allan Dulles inquired if .an uncor.ventic.’al warfare officer, v specifically Colonel Lansdale, could not be added to the group of five
. liaison officers to which General Navarre had agreed. Admiral Ralfovcl thought this might be done and at any rate Colonel Lansdale could imediately be attached, to the i-IAAG, but he •.rendered if it would, not be best for Colonel Lansdale to await General 0'Daniel's return be.forc going to Indochina. In this vetf, Colonel Lansdale could help the working group in its revision of General Erskine’s paper. This was agreeable to Mr. Allan Dulles.

SUBJECT: Report of U.S. Special Mission to Indochina ■	.	_
TO:	The Joint Chiefs of Staff
(Thru Commander-in-Chief, Pacific)	. •
. « / k	1. The attached report of my visit to Indochina covers the results
i ‘	,.	.
accomplished, action taken, and recommendations. The outstanding points are covered herein.
2.	During this visit I talked with General Navarre and other senior French officials, as well as officials of the Vietnamese government. All conversations were conducted in a spirit of frankness, with a free exchange ; of views and information.
3.	During my stay in Indochina I had two conferences with General
Navarre, in which we discussed the purpose of my visit and means and methods by 'which I could be of assistance to him. Relativc to establishing myself in Indochina as a liaison officer to him, he emphasized that he did not ■	■	t
desire U.S. over t participation at this level for political reasons but / • -that he would not objcct to periodic visits by me and my staff. Wc agreed i
on my visiting Saigon at about six weeks’ intervals. Navarre said we could try this out and discuss the matter further at my next visit.
; . z . • • • ।
;	4. In the field of psychological warfare, he was not particular!
interested in U.S. participation. On the other hand, the Vietnamese are amenable to it.
>	General Navarre stated that while he felt some concern over the
present situation, he sees no reason for changing his original plans for a fall offensive. The continued development of the Vietnamese forces is
I	,
t making possible the recovery of more units that should give him a
« . *
preponderance of forces with which to strike the enemy.

10.

15.	Naval amphibious assault units (Dinassau) are active in their assigned areas. A review of their small craft requirements is now underway, and will be the subject of another report. Meanwhile, training of new assault units is progressing.
16.	Vietnamese personnel are now considered by the French Navy to be capable of handling all small craft and, with some French supervision, larger ones. Accordingly, recuit and NCO training at NBA TRANG has been stepped up, and more Vietnamese officers are being sent to France for technical training.
17.	with U.S. programmed support, the F.U. Navy has been fully committed to operations that strain to the utmost their personnel involved. They are employing sound tactics and appear well lead in the r field.
18.	A requirement for additional maintenance and logistic support exists if the operational capabilities of the FAF in Indochina are to be maintained or increased. The arrival in Indochina on 5 February 1954 of USAF maintenance personnel will largely satisfy the requirement. No recommendation as tp additional personnel needs will be made until the work of this group can be evaluated.

14.	On February 2 and 3, I went by U.S. aircraft to Hanoi and from there by French C-47, a commercial chartered airlift plane, to Dien Bien Phu, arriving there at 1400. I was met by Colonel de Castres, CO of troops at Dien Bien Phu and was briefed by him and taken on a tour of battle positions. There are twelve French Union Battalions in the area, supported by what I consider sufficient air, armor, and artillery. The defenses lie in a valley and are sitting across the road intersection which joins there. Hills rising as high as 1000 feet or more surround the area at a distance of 3000 to 5000 yards. The dcfenses are heavily wired-in in with barbed wire, bunkers have been built and a good job of construction of fortifications is being done. Dugouts and bunkers are topped with timber and dirt.
. I had the impression that wet weather would cause much trouble through crumbling walls and leaking roofs. The defense area is twelve kilometers long and six kilometers wide. I feel that it can withstand any kind of an attack that the Viet Minh are capable of launching. However, a force with two or three battalions of medium artillery with air observation could make the area untenable. The enemy does not seem to have this capability' at present. The morale of the troops is high; they are confident that they can stop any attack. I believe that if 1 were charged with the defer e of the area, I would have been tempted to have utilized the high ground surrounding the area, rather than the low ground, and when I asked abou' this, the commander said that fields of fire were better where they were. I re-% turned to Hanoi arriving there at 1820 after a flight of one hour and

twenty minutes.

15.	I called at General Cogny’s Headquarters and had a profitable talk with him. He is a fine officer and is sound in his thinking. He is greatly concerned over having to send so much of his mobile reserve from the Delta area. He stated that the enemy has increased infiltration in the southern part of the Delta and that the 320th Viet Minh Division, as well as other units are involved. At the present time, Cogny reports twenty regular Viet Minh battalions in the Delta area, plus several individual companies. I feel that this infiltration will no doubt continue until Navarre has more troops to continue the clearing of the Delta or adopts a plan to wire in the Delta with tactical wire, covering it with fire, and then conducts a deliberate campaign to eliminate all _ enemy. I expressed these ideas to Cogny. He was non-committal but was . interested when I attempted to show him by a sketch how I thought fencing in could be done.	•
16.	I also talked with Cogny’s Deputy. He expressed the idea that the political war had to be won before thc military. I told him that I did not agree at all with such a concept and that the military had to be won first. I am sure that Cogny is of the same opinion that I am. Cogny is anxious to stay in Indochina until the war is won, although he has been there now for more than thirty months. Navarre has high regard for Cogny and no doubt Cogny will stay. I certainly hope so.	*
17.	The impression I have gained as a result of my visit to Indochina is that the French are anxious to get on with and win the war; that the military definitely want to stay until the war is brought to a successful conclusion. The French are sadly lacking in known-how in many fields,

including planning and maintenance matters. They are proud and sensitive to criticism. They need help. A step in the right direction has been made in removing obstacles standing in the way of furnishing necessary supplies; in establishing closer liaison with Navarre and in supporting the maintenance effort by sending additional U.S. maintenance personnel to Indochina. I believe that with careful handling, we can implement many of our ideas as to the conduct of the war strategically and in training matters. The machinery is in motion and my desire is to follow through in every way possible. Navarre stated that he intended to follow his plan in the conduct of the war by continuing the recovery of
battalions, forming regiments and divisions, and by launching an all-out offensive in the Fall. The Vietnamese army is making progress mainly the sound action of Secretary Defense Quat.

Visit of Lieutenant General John W. 0’Daniel to Vietnamese Defense Minister, 1 February 1954 at Saigon.
I called on the Minister of National Defense of Vietnam, Dr. Pham Huy Quat, accompanied by the Deputy Chief of Mission who served as interpreter.
Dr. Quat told me that the plan for augmentation of the Vietnamese national forces had been approved by the High Military Committee at its meeting on January 18. This called for an increase of 66 battalions in 1954, plus 16 specialized companies. However, Dr. Quat had proposed a new system of accelerating the increase of the Vietnamese National Army. This consisted in drawing on the local militia as the initial base for recruitment to the light battalions, and the light battalions, in turn, would serve as the base for filling out the regular battalions. Dr. Quat felt that, by the adoption of his system, it would be possible to decrease the present training cycle of four months to only two months. He said that if his system were adopted (and stated that it had already received the approval of Bao Dai) he could raise 130,000 additional troops in the current calcndar year.
"	i
The Minister of National Defense said that one of his great pro' lems was that of cadres. There simply were not enought officers of field grade to go round. He had an absolute ceiling limitation of 800 Fre ch officers for the Vietnamese National Army, and a large proportion of these were employed in training activities. If, by chance, he could secure Anerican officers as instructors, this would liberate an equivalent number of French officers for combat service.

Ti SIL-.'
However, Dr. Quat added in strictest confidence that when last in Paris he had discussed this problem with Marshal Juin. The Marshal asked why the Vietnamese had not found it possible to find officers "elsewhere." Quat at that time had made a request of Defense Minister Pleven for French reserve officers, promising the pay and accoutrement of active officers in the line plus an insurance policy. However, the French replied that their reserves were very scarce in number and that most of the ex-officer personnel were now in civil life.
I inquired whether, if it met with general agreement, it would be possible to pay American reserve officers, should they seek employment in the Vietnamese National forces, at the rate of salary they had received when serving in American uniform. I likewise inquired if retired Anerican colonels who were qualified to serve as Generals of Division could be given division command, rank and pay. The Defense Minister thought that, if the principle were accepted, means of payment and rank could be worked out.
Dr. Quat said, again in terms of strictest confidence, that he had received permission from Bao Dai to elaborate plans for development of a national militia. -He said the matter was a delicate one, as it had not met with complete French acquiescence, and he requested that the matter be discussed with the French. However, his studies of how to improve the militia were almost completed, and he thought that soon His Majesty would authorize him to approach the Chief of MAAG, the American Ambassador, or the reporting officer with the request for American aid to arm, train, and equip a Vietnamese.National Militia.
I queried the Minister as to what progress had been made in psychological warfare, stressing his belief that competence in this field was "half the battle" in such a war as that which prevails in Indochina.

Dr. Quat described in detail the present psychological warfare activities undertaken in "Operation Atlanta" in the three provinces extending between Nhatrang and Hue. He said that not only were GAMO teams close behind the expeditionary force, but that a new technique was being tried for the first time in Vietnam. Hitherto the French Union and Vietnamese forces had been content to overwhelm an area and then leave it relatively empty, with the result that the Viet Minh returned to territories officially listed as "pacified." Now, however, two new systems were being tried. The first was in the treatment of villages in the line of allied advance. Instead of following the old system of obliteration, three categories of villages were recognized. The first was the village which offered all-
' out resistance. This was subject to all-out attack and was wiped out, either by aerial bombardment or land assault. The sccond class of village was one which sho-wed sporadic resistance, and this was encircled by Vietnamese troops and called upon to surrender. Following capitulation, the inhabitants were divided into three sub-categories: those who were clearly Viet Minh and who were used for battle intelligence before being made prisoners; those who were merely suspect and who wcre placed in conccntration camps where, by means of psychological warfare, they might be induced to come over to the Vietnamese side; and those who were clearly the mass of the people - peasants who were promptly given work, paid in good Vietnamese piasters, and set free, although still kept under surveillance. The third type of village was that which offered no resistance whatever, but on the contrary, welcomed liberation from the advancing French and Vietnamese forces. These people were given immediate assistance and an opportunity to work with prompt payment. The Minister felt that the outcome of this

TpD QTpPtf i v » v> _ ; a A 1 experiment in the three provinces which had been entrusted largely to Vietnamese hands would be of utmost importance in developing future guidance in the realm of psychological warfare.
In response to my question, Dr. Ouat likewise indicated that his Ministry was preparing plans for training in guerrilla warfare. He was interested in the suggestion, although it did not apply' specifically to Vietnam, that in the present conflict in middle Laos prompt action in bringing Laotian guerrillas, backed up by regular battalions, to confront the Viet Minh who had invaded that area might be successful in preventing the Viet Minh from settling down in these remote jungles and mountains and so establishing themselves that their eradication would prove a time-• consuming and difficult problem.
The over-all impression given by Minister Quat was one of quiet selfconfidence in his ability to get on with the war and to succeed in his program, provided that he had sufficient backing from the French High Command and if an increased amount of American aid, both in officer training instructors and in arms for his proposed militia, were forthcoming.
Acknowledgment for this dctailed report of my meeting is made to z

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
WASHINGTON 25, D. D.
1 March 1954
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Consideration of the ROK Offer to Send a Division to Indochina
1.	In two mcssages, C-66980 dated 2 February 1954 (DA IN 36799) and KCG 2-4 dated 5 February 1954 (DA IN 37583), CINCFE has reported President Rhee’s proposal, subject to United States concurrence, to offer a Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) division to assist the Government of Laos in resisting the Viet Minh invasion of that country. In discussing this matter with General Hull on 5 February 1954, President Rhee stated that he did not' wish to make any move which would be embarrassing to the United States Government and that he would do whatever the United States Government desired him to do in this case. He felt that early action should be taken if any reinforcements are to be sent to Indochina, as the situation there appeared to him to be quite critical. He stated that, in his opinion, whatever decision is taken should be taken quickly.
2.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the implications of this problem, and submit herewith their views in the premises. * »
3.	Provided the withdrawal of a ROKA division from the United Nations forces in Korea for transfer to Indochina did not bring about a general movement on the part of our United Nations Allies to reduce their contingents in Korea, such a withdrawal would be acceptable from the standpoint of the	.
military situation in Korea.
4.	The augmentation of the French Union forces in lndo-china by one ROKA division would not, of itself, increase their military capability vis-a-vis the Viet Minh to a degree likely to be decisive.
5.	In addition to the purely military considerations, there are involved a number of important political and psychological factors having military implications which should be carefully weighed in evaluating the over-all

TOP SECRET
effects which the introduction of a ROKA division into Indochina might have. Since the substance of President Rhee's offer has now been publicized, certain psychological benefits have probably already been realized. The political factors involved cannot be finally evaluated unless and until the reactions of our Allies in Korea are determined.
6.	President Rhee does not have at his command the resources required to initiate and subsequently to support his proposed project. The French Government has repeatedly indicated that it is unable to increase above the present level its contribution to the Indochina conflict. Therefore, the material support of the project would inevitably devolve upon the United States. It follows that no matter how President Rhee’s offer is presented, and no matter what the proclaimed attitude of the United States Government might be, the sponsorship of the project would be generally ascribed to the United States in the eyes of the world.
7.	It is not possible to predict with any degree of dependability what the reaction of Communist China would be to the introduction of a ROKA division into Indochina, while a decision on the part of Communist China to intervene overtly in Indochina is more likely to be governed by other considerations, the entry of ROK forces into the lndochinese conflict might precipitate overt intervention by the Chinese Communists. In view of publicly announced United States policy, i.e., that open Red Chinese aggression in Indochina would have "... grave consequences which might not be confined to Indochina." (See paragraph 4, Annex "A" to NSC 5405), implementation of President Rhee’s offer could have grave military implications involving United States armed forces.
8.	A direct and exclusive offer of a ROKA division to Laos would probably be regarded by the governments of the other Associ lted States and of France as an affront, and could cause serious embarrassment in the matter of command relationships. Furthermore, should the forces invading Laos bc withdrawn by the Communists as was done in the previous instance, the employment of a ROKA division solely in Laos could develop into unprofitable garrison duty even though it freed other forces for active operations elsewhere in Indochina. Therefore, if President Rhee’s offer is to be formally made, it should be addressed individually and simultaneously to the governments of France, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam with the stipulation
. that the ROKA division would be made available to the Commander of the French Union forces in Indochina for employment subject only to the condition that the integrity of the division be maintained.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
9.	In addition to the foregoing, it is considered that the transfer of a ROKA division to Indochina would be attended by the following advantages and disadvantages having military implications:
Advantages
p. It would augment the present "foreign forces" of 192,000 French metropolitan and colonial troops by about 15,000 men. This would enhance the capability of the French to implement the Navarre Plan for offensive operations designed eventually to achieve a military victory, and could furnish to the French Union forces the new impetus required to accomplish this objective;
b. It could create a situation that would make it more difficult for the French to withdraw from Indochina or to negotiate a settlement with the Viet Minh of a nature prejudicial to the future freedom of the Associated States. A rejection of the offer by the French would tend to place increased onus on them to bring the Indochinese conflict to a successful military conclusion with the forces now available or planned;
p. It would represent a concrete step in fostering unity of action by anti-Communist Asiatic forces in countering Communist aggression in Asia, with immense psychological gain to the Free world;
d. It would open the way for a well-trained, battle-experienced ROKA division, by exhibiting a high standard of performance in combat, to inspire and stimulate the Vietnamese forces to greater efforts;
p... If a ROKA division performed wcll in Indochina, it would serve as a demonstration of the effectiveness of United States training methods in Korea, and might speed the adoption of comparable training methods in Indochina;
।	Disadvantages
f. It would provide President Rhee with an opportunity to exploit the situation to his own ulterior purposes. It might bc his hope that the transfer of a ROKA division to Indochina would lead to a renewal of hostilities in Korea;
p. The burden of moving and providing logistic support for the ROKA division would most certainly devolve, directly or indirectly, on the United.States. This would impose additional responsibilities, commitments, and costs on the United States Government and on the United States military
261
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
departments. The arrangements for furnishing logistic support to the ROKA division would undoubtedly involve numerous difficulties;
R. It would add to the complications and difficulties of French command relations in Indochina.
T. It would be difficult to explain and justify to the American public the transfer of a ROKA division to Indochina while still requiring the retention of United States ground forces in Korea. In all probability, serious criticism by the American public would ensue;
j.	The governments allied with us in Korea would experience similar difficulties, and this would impose additional strains upon our relations with our Allies in Korea;
k.	The situation would, in all likelihood, be widely exploited by Soviet bloc propaganda as a case of United States employment of hapless oriental puppets for the benefit of the white imperialists;
!• A ROKA division committed in Indochina would be fighting a type of warfare entirely new to it, under conditions of climate and terrain completely foreign to its previous experience, and without the accustomed United States advisors at hand. It would lack the incentive of fighting in the defense of its homeland. If under these conditions the performance of the division were poor or indifferent, the reputation of United States training methods would suffer accordingly;
tn. The language barrier would be a considerable obstacle.
10.	In the light of all of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that, from a military point of view and having due regard for the principal political and psychological factors having military implications, the transfer of a ROKA division to Indochina at this time would not be in the best interests of the United States. Therefore the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that while President Rhee should be commended by our Government for his determination to combat communist aggression in Asia even outside the borders of Korea, he should be told that we do not consider that the transfer of a ROKA division to Indochina at this time would be in the best interests of the Free world and therefore that we request he not make a formal offer to the Laotian Government.

THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.
5 March 1954
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
SUBJECT: Reappraisal of General O’Daniel's Status with Respect to Indochina
1.	Subsequent to decisions made at levels abovc the Department of Defense concerning enlargement of Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), Indochina, and appointment of a new chief thereof, information has been received which points to the need for a reappraisal of the matters involved.
2.	A recent message from the United States Ambassador to Indochina, states that General Navarre informed the Ambassador that Navarre's "very willing acceptance of General O'Daniel [USA] was predicated on the understand- • ing that the latter’s functions were limited to military assistance," that "any good ideas the General or any [U.S.] officers might produce would be put into effect wherever practicable [but that] it should be clearly understood that neither O’Daniel nor MAAG was to have any powers, advisory or otherwise, in the conduct and planning of operations, or in the training of national armies and cadres."
3.	Information available to the Joint Chiefs of Staff relative to plans of the United States Government indicates that a very considerable increase in MAAG, Indochina, personnel and in the scope of its training responsibilities is contemplated. Recent messages from the U.S. Ambassador to Indochina and the U.S. Embassy, Paris, make it apparent that General Navarre would be strongly opposed to granting increased training responsibility and authority. From this it appears that the Chief, MAAG, Indochina, will not have authority, primarily the authority of command supervision, to accompany the proposed greatly increased responsibility of the MAAG. without this capabiity to exercise command supervision, no training program can be assured of success. In the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this places a completely different complexion on the entire matter of General 0'Daniel's appointment as Chief, MAAG, Indochina.

4.	Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that it is more essential than ever, in the interests of the United States, that this basic issue of authority commensurate with responsibility be satisfactorily resolved in advance on a governmental level and in a manner acceptable to the United States.
5.	Inasmuch as this basic matter requires reconsideration, we believe that the question of the rank proposed for Lieutenant General O'Daniel, USA, as Chief, MAAG, Indochina, should be reconsidered. The Joint Chiefs of Staff hold it to be distinctly detrimental to the prestige of the United States Military Services in general,.and to the United States Army in particular to demote a distinguished senior United States Army officer already well and widely known in that region. The repercussions of such action in the Orient are well known.
6.	In light of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommcnd that:
p. The basic issue of increased responsibility of MAAG, Indochina, with respect to training be satisfactorily resolved on a governmental level, and in a manner acceptable to the United States.
b. The despatch of General O'Daniel co Indochina, and his demotion both be held in abeyance until the training issue is satisfactorily settled.

WASHINGTON 25, D. C.
12 March 1954
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Preparation of Department of Defense Views Regarding Negotiations on Indochina for the Forthcoming Geneva Conference
1.	This memorandum is in response to your mcmorandum dated 5 March 1954, subject as above.
2.	In their consideration of this problem, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed UNITED STATES OBJECTIVES AND COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA (NSC 5405), in the light of developments since that policy was approved on 16 January 1954, and they are of the opinion that, from the military point of view, the statement of policy set forth therein remains entirely valid. The Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirm their views concerning the strategic importance of Indochina to the security interests of the United States and the Free world in general, as reflected in NSC 5405. They are firmly of the belief that the loss of Indochina to the Communists would constitute a political and military setback of the most serious consequences.
’ 3. with respect to the possible course of action enumerated in paragraph 2 of your memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submit the following views:
p. Maintenance of the status quo. In the absence of a very substantial improvement in the French Union military situation, which could best be accomplished by the aggressive prosecution of military operations, it is highly improbable that Communist agreement could be obtained to a negotiated settlement which would be consistent with basic United States objectives in Southeast Asia. Therefore, continuation of the fighting with the objective of seeking a military victory appears as the only alternative to acceptance of a

compromise se.tt1ement based upon one or more of the possible other courses of action upon which the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been specifically requested in your memorandum.
b. Imposition of a cease-fire. The acceptance of a cease-fire in advance of a satisfactory settlement would, in all probability, lead to a political stalemate attended by’ a concurrent and irretrievable deterioration of the Franco-Vietnamese military position. (See paragraph 27 of NSC 5405.)
p. Establishment of a coalition government. The acceptance of a settlement based upon the establishment of a coalition government in one or more of the Associated States would open the way for the ultimate seizure of control by the Communists under conditions which might preclude timely and effectivc external assistance in the prevention of such seizure. (See subparagraph 26P of NSC 5405.)	.
C. Partition of the country. The acceptance of a partitioning of one or more of the Associated States would represent at least a partial victory for the Viet Minh, and would constitute recognition of a Communist territorial expansion achieved through force of amis. Any partition acceptable to the Communists would in all likelihood include the Tonkin Delta area which is acknowledged to be the keystone of the defense of mainland Southeast Asia, since in friendly hands it cuts off the most favorable routes for any massive southward advance towards central and southern Indochina and Thailand. (See paragraph 4 of NSC 5405.) A partitioning involving Vietnam and Laos in the vicinity of the 16th Parallel, as has been suggested (See State cable from London, No. 3802, dated 4 March 1954), would cede to Communist control approximately half of Indochina, its people and its resources, for exploitation in the interests of further Communist aggression; specifically, it would extend the Communist dominated area to the borders of Thailand, thereby enhancing the opportunities for Communist infiltration and eventual subversion of that country. Any cession of Indochinese territory to the Communists would constitute a retrogressive step in the Containment Policy, and would invite similar Communist tactics against other countries of Southeas't Asia.

e. Self-determination through free elections. Such factors as the prevalence of illiteracy, the lack of suitable educational media, and the absence of adequate communications in the outlying areas would render the holding of a truly representative plebiscite of doubtful feasibility. The Communists, by virtue of their superior capability in the field of propaganda, could readily pervert the issue as being a choice between national independence and French Colonial rule. Furthermore, it would be militarily infeasible to prevent widespread intimidation of voters by Communist partisans, while it is obviously impossible to make a dependable forecast as to the outcome of a free election, current intelligence leads the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the belief that a settlement based upon free elections would be attended by almost certain loss of the Associated States to Communist control.
4.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that any negotiated settlement which would involve substantial concessions to the Communists on the part of the Governments of France and the Associated States, such as in p and d above, would be generally regarded by Asian peoples as a Communist victory, and would cast widespread doubt on thc ability of anti-Communist forces ultimately to stem the tide of Communist control in the Far East. Any such settlement would, in all probability, lead to the loss of Indochina to the Communists and deal a damaging blow to the national will of other countries of the Far East to oppose Communism.
5.	Should Indochina be lost to the Communists, and in the absence of immediate and effective counteraction on the part of the western Powers which would of necessity be on a much’greater scale than that which could be decisive in Indochina, the conquest of the remainder of Southeast Asia would inevitably follow. Thereafter, longer term results involving the gravest threats to fundamental United States security interests in the Far East and even to the stability and security of Europe could be expected to ensue. (See paragraph 1 of NSC 5405.)
6.	Orientation of Japan toward the West is the keystone of United States policy in the Far East. In the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the loss of Southeast Asia to Communism would, through economic and political pressures, drive Japan into an accommodation with the Communist Bloc. The communization of Japan would be the probable ultimate result.

7.	The rice, tin, rubber, and oil of Southeast Asia and the industrial capacity of Japan are the essential elements which Red China needs to build a monolithic military structure far more formidable than that of Japan prior to World War II. If this complex of military power is permitted to develop to its full potential, it
would ultimately control the entire western and South-
western Pacific region and would threaten South Asia and the Middle East.
8.	Both the United States and France have invested heavily of their resources toward the winning of the struggle in Indochina. Since 1950 the United States has contributed in excess of 1.6 billion dollars in providing logistic support. France is reported to have expanded, during the period 1946-1953, the equivalent of some 4.2
billion dollars. This investment, in addition to the
heavy casualties sustained by the French and Victnamese, will have been fruitless for the anti-Communist cause, and indeed may redound in part to the immediate benefit of the cnetny, if control of a portion of Indochina should now be ceded to the Communists. While the additional commitment of resources required to achieve decisive results in Indochina might be considerable, nevertheless this additional effort would be far less than that which would be required to stem the tide of Communist advance once it had gained momentum in its progress into Southeast Asia.
9.	If, despite all United States efforts to the con-
trary, the French Government elects to accept a negotiated settlement which, in the opinion of the United States,
would fail to provide reasonably adequate assurance of the future political and territorial integrity of Indochina, it is considered that the United States should decline to associate itself with such a settlement, thereby preserving freedom of action to pursue directly with the governments of the Associated States and with other allies (notably the United Kingdom) ways and means of continuing the struggle against the Viet Minh in Indochina without participation of the French. The advantages of so doing would, from the military point of view, outweigh the advantage of maintaining political unity of action with the French in regard to Indochina.
10.	It is recommended that the foregoing views be conveyed to the Department of State for consideration in connection with the formulation of a United States position on the Indochine problem for the forthcoming Conference and for any
269
O ™ r-.

conversation with the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and, if deemed advisable, with the governments of the Associated States preliminary to the conference. In this connection, attention is particularly requested to paragraphs 25 and 26 of NSC 5405; it is considered to be of the utmost importance that the French Government be urged not to abandon the aggressive prosecution of military operations until a satisfactory settlement has been achieved.
11.	It is further recommended that, in order to be prepared for possible contingencies which might arise incident to the Geneva Conference, the National Security Council considers now the extent to which the United States would be willing to commit its resources in support of the Associated States in the effort to prevent the loss of Indochina to the Communists either:
_a. In concert with the French; or
P. In the event the French clect to withdraw, in concert with other allies or, if necessary, unilaterally.
12.	In order to assure ample opportunity for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to present their views on these matters, it is requested that the Military Services be represented on the Department of Defense working team which, in coordination with the Department of State, will consider all U.S. position papers pertaining to the Geneva discussions on Indochina.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE, ESC
SUBJECT: Military Implications of the U. S. Position on Indochina in Gene Vet
1.	The attached analysis and recoinmendations concerning the U. S. position in Geneva hare been deVeloped by a Subcommittee consisting of representatiVes of the Department of Defense, JOS, State, and CIA.
2.	This paper reflects the conclusions of the Department of Defense and the JCS and has been collaborated With the State Department represcntatiVea who have reserVed their position thereon.
3.	In brief, this paper concludes that from the point of view of the U. S. strategic position in Asia, and indeed throughout the world, no solution to the Indochina problem short of Victory is acceptable. It recommends that this be ■the basis for the U. S. negotiating position prior to and at the Geneva Conference.
4.	It also notes that, aside from the improvement of the present military situation in Indochinas none Of the courses of action considered provide a satisfactory solution to-the Indochina War.
5.	The paper notes that the implications of this position arc such as to merit consideration by the NSC and the President.
6.	I recommend that the Special Committee note and approVe this report and forward it with the official Department of State Views to the NSC.

I.	PROBLEM
To develop a U. S. position With reference to the GeneVa Conference as it relates to Indochina, encompassing the military implications of certain alternatives Which might arise in connection With that conference. •
II• HAJOR CONSIDERATIONS
A. The Department of Defense and the JCS have reviewed NSC $h05 in the light of doVelcp-ents since that policy was approVca from a military point Of View and in the light of certain possible courses of action as they affect the Geneva Conference. These are:
1.	Maintenance of the status quo in Indochina.
2.	Imposition of a cease-fire in Indochina, 3. Establishment of.a coalition gOVernment.
h. Partition of the country.	'
5. Self-determination through free elections.
13. The Department of Defense and the JCS haoe also considered the impact of the possible future status of Indochina . on the remainder of Southeast Asia and Japan and have considered the effect Which any substantial concessions to the Communists on the part Of France and the Associated States would have with respect to Asian peoples as a v/hole and U. S. objectiVOS in Europe.
•	f
C.	Indochina is the area in Which the Communist_and non-Communist worlds confront one another actiVely on the field of battle. -The loss of this battle by Whatever means would haVe the most serious repercussions on U. S. and fre-world interests, not only in Asia but in Europe and elsewhere.
D.	French withdrawal or defeat in Indochina, would have most serious consequences on the French position in the World; the free World position in Asia; and in the U, S. on the domestic attitude vis-a-Vis the French. It would, furthermore, constitute a de facto failure on the part cf France to abide by its commitment in U. N. to repel aggression.	•	_	. .’
E.	Unless the free world maintains its position in Indocliina. j the Co—munists will bo in a position to exploit

• what Will be Widely regarded in Asia as a Communist victory. Should Indochina be lost to the Communists, and in the absence of immediate and effective counteraction by the freo world (Which Would of nsceayity be on a much greater scale than that required to be decisive in Indochina), the conquest of the remainder of Southeast Asia Would ineVitably folloW. Thereafter, longer term results, probably forcing Japan into an accommodation with the Communist bloc$ and threatening the stability and security of Europe, could be ’ expected to ensue.
F.	As a measure of U. S. participation in the IndoChinese War i-t is noted that the U. S. has since 1950 programmed in excess of s?2,L billion dollars in support of the French-Associated States operations in Indochina# France is estimated to have expended during tho period l9a-6-l953 the equiVaient Of sOme SpA billion. This investment, in addition to the heavy casualties sustained by the French and Victna-ngse5 to say nothing of the great moral and political involvement Of the- U. S. and French, Will haue been fruitless for the anti-Communist cause if control of all or a portion of Indochina should noW be ceded tc the . Communists.
III.	FACTS BEARIriG ON THE PROBLEM
A.	NSC 5hO5> approved January 16, l95’-r, states U. S. policy With respect to Tndochina«
B.	The French desire for peace in indochina almost at any cost represents our greatest Vulnerability in the GeneVa talks.	•
IV.	DISCUSSION
For the Views of the JCS see Tab A.
V.	CONCLUSIONS
A.	Lons of Indochina, to the Communists would constitute a political and military setback Of the most serious consequences and would almost certainly lead to the ultimate Communist domination of all of Southeast Asia.
B.	The U. S. pclicy and objectives with respect to Southeast Asia as ref .leetOd in NSC 5105 remain entirely valid in the light of deVelopments since that policy was approved,
C,	With respect to possible alternative courses of action enumerated in paragraph- lit above, the Department of Defense has reached the following .conclusions:

The Special Committee recognizes moreover that certain supplementn.ry and alternatiVe courses of action designed to ensure a favorable resolution of the situation in Indochina merit consideration by the NSC.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT'S SPECIAL. COMMITTEE ON IN DO-CHINA;
SUBJECT: Discussions with Gcncral Paul Ely.
• . * . ...
1.	During the pcriod 20-24 March I conducted a scries cf discussions with Gcncral Ely, Chairman of thc French Chicfs of Staff, on the situation in Indo-China. I am setting forth hcfcin a summary report of thcsc discussions with particular relation to those itcms which were includcd in Phase A report submitted by thc Spccial Committee.
2.	Gcncral Ely rcqucstcd urgent action for the United Statcs to effect early dclivcry of various items of material that had previously been requested through thc MAAG-Indo-China, These requests were all met to thc satisfaction of General Ely with exccption of:
a,	14 C-47 airCraft which arc in critical supply and were not in thc urgent category.
b.	20 hclicopters and 80 additional U.S. maintenance per-sonncl. An alternative solution is now bcing worked out through routine channels.	*	.

3.	In connection with thc foregoing is the solution that was cvolved e	•
to meet thc French request for 25 additional B-26 aircraft for a third squadron, There is no doubt that French capabilitics for maintenance and aircraft utilization fall far short of acccptablc standards and that thc supply of additional aircraft alone is not thc remedy to inadequate air power in Indo-China. However, in view of the importance of thc morale factor »
at thc prcscnt time in relation to thc struggle for Dien Dien Phu, it was agrccd, and the President has approved, to lend thc Frcnch these aircraft. Certain conditions were imposcd which Gcricral Ely accepted:
a. A .special inspection team headed by an Air Force Gcncral Officcr would procccd to Indo-China iinmcdiatcly to examinc French maintenance, supply problems, and utilization of U.S. aircraft furnished thc French. A report will be madc to thc Secretary of Defensc
with a copy being given to Gcncral Navarre.
. b, Thc aircraft will be returned to thc U.S. Air Force at thc end of thc current fighting season about the end of May, or earlier if required for servicc in Korea, Decision as to permanent ac-ccptancc and support of thc third F>-26 squadron will be madc after thc report of thc special examination (para 3 a abovc) has bcen analyzed,

*
Air.Force to supply- additional aviation mcchanics to Indo-China and to
replace our 200 U.S, Air Forcc mcchanics along thc following lincs:
a.	Thc tour of duty of 2.00 French mechanics due for carly return to France is being cxtcndcd two months. This .will permit the opcration of thc 25 additional B-26s without need for more U.S. personnel. 15 Air crews now in training in France and North Africa arc bcing sent by air to Indo-China.
b.	Fifty mechanics are bcing sent from France within thc next month and beginning 1 June, one hundred additional per
• month will bc sent to a total of 450,
c.	Thc 100 U.S, Air Force mechanics can be relcased
"within 8 days of 15 June”,
5,	General Ely raised thc question of obtaining authorization to usc t
thc C-119 transports to drop napalm at Dien Bien Phu. Although thc U.S.
doos not cxpcct spectacular results, this was approvcd on condition:
a.	No U.S. crews were Involved.
b,	Thc French high command requested the diversion of this
air lift capability to meet the cmergcncy situation at Dien Blcn Phu.

6.	I presented to Gcncral Ely our views in regard to expanding the ) MAAG to assist the .French in training thc Vietnamese, indicating to him thc importance which we attach to this action, first, to obtain better re-«
sults, secondly to release Frcnch officers for cornbat scrvicc. Gcncral •	. J
Ely was most unsympathetic to any encroachment on French responsibilities or significant expansion of the MAAG. The reasons given rekited to French ’’prestige”, possible lack of confidence in French leadership by thc Vietnamese, "thc political situation in France” etc, The only commitments I was able to get from General Ely were;
a.	He would urge Gcncral Navarre to be most sympathetic
• to the advice given by the officcrs reccntly assigned to MAAG
(such as Colonel Rosson).
b.	He would request General Navarre to discuss thc utilization of U.S. staff officcrs with Gcncral O’Daniel ’’on thc spot in a broad, understanding and comprehensive manner”. 1 would make
a similar request, of Gcncral G’Danicl. ✓
c.	He would make some informal soundings in Paris on the
subject of increased U.S. participation in training and would com-
municate further with me - informally - through Gcncral Valluy.
I conclude that thc Frcnch are disposed firmly to resist any delegation
of training responsibilities to the U.S, MAAG.	.

7,	Much thc same attitude was manifested by Gcncral Ely in regard to U.S. operations in thc fields of psychological, clandestinc and guerrilla warfare. No commitment was obtained except that Gcncral Ely would discuss thc matter .with Mr. Allen Dulles (which hc did).
8.	General Ely submitted h fcquest in writing, copy attached as .Enclosure "A”, as to what action thc U.S. would lake if aircraft bascd in China intervened in Indo-China. I exchanged thc following agreed minute ' with him on this matter:	.
I
■	"In respect to Gcncral Ely’s memorandum of ?.3 March 1954,
it was decided that it was advisable that military authorities push , thcir planning work as far as possible so that there would bc no time wasted when and if our governments decided to oppose enemy air intcrvcntion over Indo-China if it took place; and to check all planning arrangements airCady made under previous agreements
* , , . . .
• between CINGFAC and the CING Indo-China and send instructions to thosc authorities to this effect."
<	4
9. Thc particular situation at Dien F>ien 1 hu was discussed in detail, ■' <
Gcncral Ely indicated that thc chance for success was, in his estimate, ”50-50”. He discounted any possibility of sending forces ovcrland to re-licve the Frcnch Garrison. Hc recognized thc great political and psychological importance of the outcome both in Indo-China and in France but considercd that Dicn Bien Phu, cvcn if lost, would bc a military victory

for thc French because of thc cost to the Viet Minh and thc relatively	$	,
greater loss to thc Viet Minh combat forces. Politically and psychologically the loss of Dicn Dicn Phu would bc a very serious setback to thc French *	1
Union causc, and might cause unpredictable repercussions both in France
and Indo-China.	•
.	10. In regard to the gcncral situation in Indo-China Gcncral Ely’s
vlcws were essentially as follows. Thc loss of Indo-China would opcn up all of South East .Asia to ultimate Communist domination. Victory in IndoJ
China is as much a political as a military matter. The Frcnch hope to •» get agrcement with the Viet Nam in current discussions in Paris which
will implement thc July 3rd declaration and Icad to more enthusiastic cor opcration and participation in thc war by the Vietnamcsc. They hope also to get more positive lcadership from Bao Dai who, at this timc, is the only potcntial native leadcr. From the more optimistic point of view, assuming that Dicn Bien Phu was hold and native support assured, hc expected that military successes but not total military victory would bc achieved in ✓
1954-1955, following thc broad concept of the Navarre Plan and within
presently programmed rcsourccs. Ultirnatc victory will requirc thc creation of a strong indigenous army, extending operations to thc north and west, manning and defending thc Chinese frontier and thc commitment of resources greatly in excess of those which Francc alonc can supply. Ue envisages sonic sort of a coalition or regional security arrangement by thc
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3

1	1.1 raised with Gcncral Ely thc question of promoting Gcncral .	•	I
Navarre in order that General O’Danicl might retain his rank of Lt, General
without embarrassment to Navarre. Gcncral Ely made no commitment,
pointing out that rank in thc Frcnch Army resulted front a Cabinet action depending upon scniority. He indicated that thc Cabinet might possibly consider a promotion for Gcncral Navarre if Dicn mien Fhu was held.
12	, General Ely made quite a point of cxplaining in "great frankness" actions on the part of the United States which were causes of friction.
Those mentioned specifically were:
a.	Americans actcd cis if the United States sought to control
• and operate everything of importance; that this was particularly truc at lower levels and in connection with FCA opcrations.
b.	The Unitcd States 'appcars to have an invading nature as thcy undertake everything in such grcat numbers of pcoplc.
c.	Frcnch think that McCarthyism is prevalent in thc U.S.
and actually is akin to Hitlerism.
d,	Americans do not appreciate the difficulties under whic’
the Frcnch must operate as a result of two devastating wars.
c. Many Amcricans appear to favor Germany ovcr France.

I endcnvorcd to sct the record straight on cach of these particulars, and stressed thc fact that Americans were growing very impatient with France over its lack of action on the EDG and German rearmament and Frcnch tendencies to overemphasize their prestige and sensitivxtics.
13.	General Ely indicated that the leaders of thc prcscnt Frcnch Govcrnment were fully aware of the importance of denying Indo-China to the Communists and thc prevention of Communist domination of South East Asia, He stated that they would take a strong position at thc Geneva Conference but, inasmuch as France could make no concessions to Com-rnunist China, thcy looked to thc United States for assistance as the United States could contribute action that thc Communist Chinese sought, i.c., recognition and re luxation of trade controls.

14,	During thc course of the discussions General Ely stressed that, I	from the military standpoint, ond of the major deficiencies in Indo-China
was offensive air power, I took this opportunity to pose thc proposition of incorporating an air component within the framework of the Forcign Legion or alternatively forming an International Volunteer Air Group for operations in Indo-China.

undertaken by thc Frcnch will prove to bc inadequate and initiated Loo Into to prevent a progrcssive deterioration of thc situation in Indo-China.

’MEMORANDUM FOR: ADMIRAL ARTHUR W. RADFORD • Chairman, Joint Chicfs of Staff
FROM: GENERAL PAUL. ELY
Thc absence of enemy air has bccn a characteristic of the military
situation in lndoc)iina since the beginning of operations. Therefore, an enemy air intervention would carry gravc consequences.
On thc other hand, the lack of jcltablc airfields in Victrninh controlled areas leads to thc conclusion that any intcrvention by modcrn air-• . *
crafts would start from Chinese territory,
’ •
Without prejudging decisions of a gcncral nature which our govcrn-ments could take in the cvent of an air aggression starting from China, it seems to me it will bc of somc use to study thc best way of limiting the cffccts that such an attack might havc on thc French Air Force units and on the Corps Expcditionnaire even if it were carried out by aircra v of a doubtful nationality; this last assumption has not bccn made so far.

MEMORANDUM FOR HIE PRESIOEM 1’
SUHJEGT: Discussions with Gcncral Ely relative to thc situation in Indo-China.
1.	During thc period 10-24 March I conducted a scries of discussions with General Ely, Chairman of the Frcnch Chiefs of Staff, on thc situation in Indo-China. In addition, General Ely confcrrcd with the Sccretary of Statc, Sccrctary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of CIA and the U.S. Military Representative to NATO.
2.	General Ely rcqucstcd urgent action to make carly delivery of various items of material that had previously bccn rcqucstcd through the MAAG Indo-Chiha, These were all arranged to thc satisfaction of General Ely except for 14 3-47 transport aircraft which are in critical supply and did.not come in thc urgent category. Noteworthy is thc supply of 25 additional b-26s for a third squadron which will b,c furnished immcdiatcly on a temporary loan basis. A rcccnt requcst for 10 helicopters and 80 additional U.S, rnaintenancc pcrsonnel was discussed and he was informed that it was not possiblc to grant thc requcst at this time.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 201 I
3.	General Ely made no significant concessions in response to suggestions which would improve thc situation in Indo-China. He explained Frcnch difficulties involving domcstic problems and maintenancc of prestigc as basic rcasons for his non-concurrcncc. He agrecd to explorc informally the possibility of accepting limited U.S. assistance in training the Vietnam-esc, but is generally in opposition,
4.	Gcncral Ely submitted a requcst in writing as to what action thc
U.S, would takc if aircraft based in China intervened in Indo-China. No
— •
commitment was made. Th’c matter is being referrcd to thc Secrctary of
State
5.	Gcncral Ely affirmed thc gravity of the situation at Dicn Hicn Phu stating the outcome as 50-50, and emphasized thc great importance of that
battlc from thc political and psychological standpoint. In this I am in full
accord but sharc the doubts of othcr members of thc Joint Chiefs of Staff
as to the adequacy of thc mcasures being taken by Gcncral Navarre. He was givcn .approval to use C-119 transport aircraft to drop Napalm pro-
vided no U.S..crews wcrc involved

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
.	6. Gcncral Ely expressed the view that military succcsscs but not
total .military victory were to bc expectcd in 1954-1955, with the prcscntly programmed resources in pursuance of thc Navarre PJan, He considers
the problem in Indo-China to be political as well as military. Ultimatc victory will require thc independence of the Associated Statcs, dcvclop-rnent of a strong indigenous army, manning and defending thc Chinesc frontier and commitment of resources greatly in cxccss of thosc which France can supply. He cnvisagcs some sort of coalition by thc nations of S. E', Asia.
7. As a result of thc foregoing confercnccs I am gravely fcarful that thc measures being taken by thc French will prove to bc inadequate and
initiated too late to prevent n progressive deterioration of the situation.
Thc consequences can well lead to thc loss of all of S. E, Asia to Com-
munist domination, .lf this is to be avoided, I consider that the U.S. must
bc pre parcel to act promptly and in force possibly to a frantic and bclatcd ✓
requcst by thc French for U.S,, intervention.

With above in mind and following Secretary’s talk With Makins Which will be reported to you, you should sec Eden and reiterate to him our position along following lines;
1, We clearly understood from Bidau.lt at Berlin that our agreement to discuss Indochina at Gonova was on condition Franco would not agree to any arrangement which would directly or indirectly result turnover area to Communists. We presume British because of vital security interests in area as well as their role in free world would solidly support this position.
2* Our views on any spccrfal position for Communist China at Geneva have already been made clear (DEPTEL 1^32‘iupeated Paris as 3340).
3,	Our basic position on Communist China in contained in Secretary’s March 29 speech of which you should give copy to Eden if you have not already, particularly emphasizing eighth paragraph from end in which is contained following sentence; ”Wo shall not however be disposed to give Communist China what it wants from us-merely to buy its promisos of future good behavior." ✓
4.	Insofar as development US posit5.cn is concerned, our preliminary vicars on substance and proccdurc contained numbered paragraphs 1 and 2 DEPTEL 3401 to Faris (repeated London 5067, Saigon lSMj) and these views should also bc conveyfed Eden.

The first issue turns on whether the French Union can and Will prevent the loss of Indochina and vzhat further actions; if any, the United States can take to bolster or assist the French efforts Some of these c_uestions Were covered by the Report of the Special Committee Of March 17? 1951-. Others are matters of continuous intelligence estimates. At the present time there is clearly a possibility that a trend in the direc-ticn Of the -loss of Indochina to Communist control may become irreversible over the next year in the absence oi greater U»3.	’
participation9 There is not, however, any certainty that the French hate as yet reached the point of being Willing to accept a Settlement Which is unacceptable to U.S. interests or to cease their military effortse Moreoter, regardless of the outcome of the fight at Dienbienphu; there is no indication that a military decision in Indochina is imminent.

Withdraw, and French Willingness to cooperate in phasing out

in such opposition, U. S. interVention in Indochina would in effect be precluded. If, after a French decision to withdraw, the Associated States should appeal for U.

2,	The immediate objective of U, S, military interVen-

However, Whether Or not the action can-be limited to ■ • . • Indochina once U. S. forces and prestige haVe been commltted, disengagement will not be possible short of Victory.

On balance, the French would prefer to find a solution Of thc Indochina problem which did not involve U. S. military participation, although such solution might in. our opinion risk the ultimate loss cf Indochina. In the event of U. S, military participation the French could be expected to attempt progressively to shift the military burden of the war to the l
United States, either by withdrawing their forces or failing ■ to make good attrition.
20. Associated States Reaction: The Associated States Would not be interested in U.

Nationalist China and the Republic of Korea would welcome U, S. interVention in Indochina, since both would hope that this would lead to general war between the Uniteci Statesand Communist China. President Rhee, in particular, might be tempted to believe that his chances of inVolVing the United States in a renewal of Korean hostilities Were greatly enhanced. Thailand, if assured Of U. S. guarantees • of adequate permanence would probably permit the use of Thai territory and facilities. The Philippines Would support U.

*	POSITION ON NSC'ACTION NO. 1074-A
1. There are important military disadvantages to intervention in Indochina under the assumptions set forth in NSC Action No. 1074-a.
.	2. A military victory in Indochina cannot be assured by U.S.
intervention with air and naval forces alone.
3.	The use o f atomic weapons in Indochina‘would not reduce the number of ground forces required to achieve a military victory
■	in Indochina.
4.	It is estimated that seven U.S. divisions or their equivalent, with appropriate naval and air support, would be required to win a victory in Indochina if the French withdraw and the Chinese ■	Communists do not intervene. However, U.S. military intervention
must take into consideration the capability of the Chinese Communists to intervene.
5.	It is estimated that the equival ent of 12 U.S. divisions would be required to win a victory in Indochina, if the French withdraw and the Chinese Communist intervene.
6.	The equivalent of 7 U.S. divisions would be required to win a victory in Indochina if the French remain and the Chinese Communi st s i ntervene.
7.	Requirements for air and naval support for ground force .operations are:
,	1
a.	Five hundred fighter-bomber sorties per day exclusive of interdiction and counter-air operations.
b.	An airlift capability of a one division drop.
c.	A division amphibious lift. • ■
8.	One U.S. airborne regimental combat team can be placed in Indochina in 5 days, on e additional division in 24 days, and the remaining divisions in the following 120 days. This could be accomplished partially be reducing U.S. ground strenght in the Far East with the remaining units coming from the general reserve in the
•	United States. Consequently, the U.S. ability to meet its NATO
commitment would be seriously effected for a considerable period.
The time required to place a total of 12 divisions in Indochina would depend upon the industrial and personnel mobilization measures taken by the government.

I - IPS. PPOrilo
To set forth a program of action without resort to overt combat operations by U.Sc forces, designed to: (a) secure thc military defeat of Communist forces «•
in Indo-Chinay and (b) establish a western oriented complex in Southeast Asia »
incorporating Indo-China, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines 6	.
II - MAJCR CONSIDERATIONS	• •
(A) Indo-China is considered the keystone of the arch of Southeast Asi?., and the Indo-Chinese peninsula must not be permitted to fall under Communist domination, This requires the defeat in Indo-China of military and quasi-military Communist forces and tho development of conditions conducive to successful resistance to any Communist actions to dominate the area. Measures taken in
Indo-China, however, must be in consonance with U.S, and allied action taken in thc Far East and Southeast Asia to defeat Communist efforts to extend their control of tho areas
.(B) Feasible actions to provide for the immediate U.S, assistance requested by the French for operations in the Dien Bien Pha-.Central Laos sector have been taken0 The measures recommended herein will hardly affcct the immediate tactical situation in those areas (which, while serious; is not as critical as public pronouncements suggest). They are designed to effect a general improve-. ment in the over-all situation in Indc-China, which is such that afd actions

•.‘LkOJer.	JI
must be considered a matter of urgency to bc implemented without delay, They are also designed to achieve the desired results in Indo-China without overt involvement by U.S. coribat forces &	’	.	.
(C)	The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Central Intelligence’ Agency have developed a program of support for the Navarre Plan in Indo*China3 This plan consi.ders certain basic immediate requirements for continued U.Se support for Franco-’Vietnmesc operations and some of these recommendations have been implemented, The remaining actions have been incorporated hereunder in paragraph III (A)o However, there is implicit in many of these proposals a requir-em-nt for a stronger French political and military effort as well as more effective support for Vietnamese participation, The alternative to more precise and extensive action by the French and Vietnamese, as proposed by the U.S., appears to be a continued stalemate or debacle in Indo-China.
(D)	It would appear that France cannot ’-.dthm'aw her forces 'from Indo-
China without serious deterioration of her position as a world power,
(E)	The key to the success of military operations continues to be the generation of well-trained/ properly lad indigenous forces effectively employed in combat operations against the Communist forces in Viet Minh, The eventual goal must be the development of homogeneous indigenous units with a native officer corpse In this the French have had, for whatever reason, insufficient success. Such success will ultimately be dependent upon the inspiration of the local population to fight for their own freedom from Communist domination and the willingness of the French both to take the measures to stimulate that inspiration and to more fully utilize the native potential. At the same tine, French sensitivities with respect to their sacrifices, responsibilities, and capabilities tust bc respected, as we persuade and assist them to correct existing defici-enciss.

(F)	The UcSc objective in Indo-China should be centralized UVS» control and coordination of all UeSa military, military aid, and "unconventional werfare" (vhich includes psychological warfare, guerrilla warfare, and certain aspects of pacification operations) mechanisms in Indo.Cb.ina,
(G)	There is in Indo-China, or programmed for Indo-China (and anticipating continued U4S« assistance) a sufficient amount of equipment and supplies and a potential manpower., pool sufficient eventually to defeat the Communists decisively if properly utilised and maintained and if the situation continues to permit this manpower to be converted into military effectivenessc In their own report the French have acknowledged that U0S0 aid in many areas has exceeded French capacity to absorb it0
(H)	Measures advocated by the, U?S, must be so characterised by determination. strength, confidence, and justice that they serve to enhance the support •	4
of all Asians who seek freedom, both from Communist domination and western colonization3 Asians must be convinced that they ’.-ill have a far better future with the Free t’orld than under Communism and th.it there is not to be reinstitution of cclonialismo
(I)	Thc Communists in Indo-China, Southeast Asia, China, and Moscow must bc made aware that "the United States, France, and tho free governments of the Far East are united, steadfast, and capable of accomplishing their aimsc

III *- FACTS HEARING ON THE PROBLEM	.	. •
; -
_Ao Southeast Asia comprises some l?O milJJ.on people in an area just emerging from the colonial eras Standards of living and of literacy are very low. With the exception of Viet Nam, military forces are inconsiderablee Thc number and quality of lenders, administrators^ and technicians is far below mini.mum requirements5 The prospects of political or economic stability daring this generation are dim, except in thc Philippines and perhaps in Thailand^
Bo The peoples of Southeast Asia arc accustomed to the rule of the many • ✓ . by the very few at the level of their central government. Their principal national political vitality expresses itself as "anti-colonialism" and the termination of all foreign domination rather than in a desire for political democracy or for the political liberties upon which the Western concept of the world ideological struggle is based#
Co Southeast Asia is a part of and ethnically associated with tho Asian continent, principally China, China today is the base of international . Communism in the Far East. With the exception of Australia, to which Southeast Asian states are not ideologically oriented, anti-Communist bases are very distant. Certain of them are associated with colonialism in the minds of the • ’ . . .
people of Southeast Asia, Western influence^ both m Southeast Asia and in Korea,, has not been effective in preventing the spread of Communism. This results in increased vulnerability of some Southeast Asian countries to Communist intluences.

Ds Nationalism that expresses itself in Asia as anti-colonialism, if properly guided, is also a potential weapon against Communist imperalisrn At thc present time, however, some Asins tend to regard "Western colonialism" as more evil and pressing than the possible future- threat of Communist impsrElisin.
Eo Economically, the countries of Southeast Asia vary in their products and market?:. Many major export products of the are?, (rubber, tin, copra., etc,) are absorbed by the West. However; rice production is a natter of pan-Asian concern as is oil production,	'	.
Ft Southeast Asxa as a region is less homogeneous than the Atlantic Community or the American Republics in the factors making for real regional consistency and strength.. There arc major ethnic and religious differences as well as traditional emnitiess There is no sense of a common danger as regards C ommuni st impofml i sm„ . ’ * •
G-. Current developments^ including military operations in the Associated States and the forthcoming Geneva Conference, will have a major influence on future U.S. policy throughout Southeast Asia.

IV " CONCLUSIONS	.
.	Ac The Special Committee considers that these factors reinforce the
necessity of assuring that Indo-China remain in the non-Communist bloc, and believes that defeat of the Viet Minh in Indo-China is essential if tho spread of Communist influence in Southeast Asia is to be halted,

n '	• (3) It be the UESs position in event of failure of (2) above to
initiate immediate steps with the governments of thc Associated States aimed toward the continuation of the war in Indo--China, to
•include active U.Se participation and without French support should that be necessaryo
(4) Regardless of whether or not tho U,S. is successful in obtaining French support for the active U.S, participation called for in (3) above, every effort should be made to underbake this active participation’in concert with other interested nations 5
Be The Special Committee also considers that all possible political and economic pressure on France must be exerted as the obvious initial course of action to reinforce the. French will to continue operatings in Indo-Ch.ina3 The Special Committee recognises that this course of action will jeopardize the existing French Cabinet; may be unpopular among the French public, and may bc considered as endangering present U4S0 policy with respect to EDC» Thc Committee nevertheless considers that the free world strategic position, not only in Southeast Asia but in Europe and the Middle East as well, is such as to require the most extraordinary efforts to prevent Communist domination of Southeast Asiae The Committee considers that firm and resolute action now in this regard may well be thc key to a solution of thc entire problem posed by France n the free world community of nations.
Ce In order to make the maximum contribution to free world strengvn in

Southeast Asia, and regardless of the outcome of military operations currently in progress in Indo-China, the U,S. should, in all prudence, take the following courses of action in addition to those set forth in NSC 5409 and in Part I of the Special Committee report:

appears that, in any case, considorablo time may elapse before an effective organization may be developed. However, it doos appear that a preliminary survey should bo made by the individual appointed by thc President for the development of this project. For initiation of this preliminary phase it is believed that the procedure outlined in the following paragraphs should be undertaken.
2.	The President should appoint an individual of international standing as a special and personal representative of the President. Such
an appointment, during the preliminary phase, should not be limited to any specific assignment. This individual should not be 'classified as a "roving Ambassador" but he should have ambassadoral rank.
3.	Having appointed this individual, thc President should immediately
and publicly request this special representative to undertake a survey of Southeast Asia for the purpose of making a detailed report on con-
ditions and problems directly to the President. This report to form t
basis for further development of the regional arrangement among Southeast Asian States.	'	.

Thereafter, he should probably also go to Korea and Japan. It is not thought that the special represen-tativa should go to Bu—pa oxcopt upon receipt of a specific invitation from tho Burmese government,
6.	Thc special representative should enter into any discussions with tho governments of Southeast Asia through the respective Ambassadors and any arrangements made with those governments should be consumated by the Ambassadors or by tho government itself,
7.	It should ba the publicly announced mission of the special representative to undertake a fact-finding mission. He should not himself

8, On the contrary, the special representative should act only as a catalytic agent and should offer to assist in the solution of problem areas by appropriate intercession in the U.S. For this purpose, • ■ '
the special repfosentatife should initially be based in the U.S. although for his initial survcv he may wish to establish an advance headquarters with a small staff in some appropriate Southeast Asian country.

seek an expansion of bilateral and multilateral agreements between the several Southeast Asian states such as those already established between Cambodia and Laos and between Thailand and Viet Nam.

of economic or cultural agreomants; defense arrangements should initially

,IUi	ITEM 1 (For Consideration)
POSSIBLE U, S. INTERVENTION IN INDO-CHINA (NSC Action 1074-p)
PROBLEM
1.	To consider and make recommendations • to the President on appropriate action regarding Indo-China and on the need for U.S. military intervention.
SUMMARY
2.	The paper consists of a brief report from the Planning Board and an annex which analyzes alternative forms of U.S. intervention. The annex is summarized in TAB At t
3.	The report states there are four issues to be decided by the Council. These are:
p. will Indo-China be lost unless the U.S, commits combat forces?
This involves several specific questions:
(1)	Is the military situation critical? (The report says not
•	yet but that it is deteriorating.)
(2)	Are the French likely to negotiate an unsatisfactory settlement at Geneva unless the U.S. is prepared to intervene? (The report says this is uncertain.)
(3)	Have we exhausted all practicable political and diplomatic measures to encourage the French to live up to their commitments? (The report says the U.S. should make a maximum diplomatic effort to cause the French and Associated States to continue to fight to a successful conclusion.)
U. What are the risks, requirements, and consequences of alternative forms of U.S. military intervention? ■
(See the annex or TAB A - The alternatives, to be valid, involve assumptions: either the French and Associated States both will invite U.S. military intervention or the Associated States will issue the invitation alone if thc French intend to withdraw. The annex also discusses the question of use of nuclear weapons.)
p. Should the U.S, intervene rather than losc Indo-China and if so on which alternative? ---------------------
.	(The risks of intervention are high, but the loss of Indo-China
would result probably in, at least, the loss of South East Asia. A regional grouping (Altern. B) would bring Asian allies to help fight and thus be good, although it would require time and a need to give defense commitments and assurances that intervention is not intended to overthrow

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
Communist China. A UN action is not desirable. Unilateral intervention (Alterns. A or C) might be politically difficult at home and abroad.) d. when and under what circumstances should thc decision to intervene be taken and carried into effect?
(The report says - par. 7-p, page 7 - "on balance, it appears that the U.S. should now reach a decision whether or not to intervene with combat forces, if that is necessary to save Indo-China from Communist control and, tentatively, the form and condition of such intervention." Thc real issue, however, in light of the French request for urgent help at Dien Bien Phu, is that the Council must decide whether it is essential to intervene now with little or no time to (1) work out arrangements with the French (including acceptance of conditions, command arrangements, etc.), (2) condition public and Congressional opinion - intervention may involve our drafting men for Indo-China where the French have never yet sent a conscript - and (3) try to prepare a regional type arrangement. Decision to act later may take care of these difficulties but might come too late to save Dien Bien Phu.)
COMMENTS
4.	In reaching any decision the Council should affirmatively decide that regardless of the numbers or types of U.S, military forces initially involved once the U.S, physically intervenes we must be prcparcd to expend whatever resources are necessary to secure victory. Involved are increased risks of Chinese Communist intervention or general war, steps to prepare the U.S. to meet these increased risks, and reversal of plans to reduce the size of U.S. armed forces.
5.	The views of the Service Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be available at the Armed Forces Policy Council meeting at 11:30 a.m., 6 April.
6.	[An associated problem is that the U.S. has accepted an invitation to meet with the French on 12 April 1954 to exchange views on Indo-China, preparatory to the Geneva Conference. It is important that the U.S. representation at this meeting be at a high level (at least Mr. Robertson), with Department of Defense representation.]
RECOMMENDATIONS
7.	It is recommended that you:	i
p. Agree that the U.S. must intervene if necessary to avoid the loss of Indo-China, but advocate that no steps be left untaken to get tl French to achieve a successful conclusion of the war on their own.
b.	Support Alternative B (regional grouping with maximum Asian participation) as the best of the alternatives for intervention, subject to discussion in the AFPC.
c.	Base your decision as to whether immediate intervention at Dien Bien-Phu should be approved on the results of discussion in the AFPC.

SUMMARY OF PLANNING BOARD ANNEX TO ITS REPORT ENTITLED, "NSC ACTION NO, 1074-a"
1.	Problem: To assess risks, requirements, and consequences of alternate forms of US military intervention in Indochina. The objective of intervention is, in the absence of overt Chinese Communist intervention, destruction of organized Viet Minh forces by military action.
2.	Nuclear weapons: Nuclear weapons will be available for use as required by the tactical situation and as approved by the President. Estimated force requirements contained in this paper are based on assumption of such availability.
3.	Alternative A: Commitment of US forces in concert with thc French.
a. Military requirements: Assuming military situation is approximately as at present, US military requirements would be:
(1)	Ground Forces: None, provided that French Union forces afford adequate security for the forces in Indochina.
(2)	Naval Forces:	1 Carrier Task Group, plus additional support-
ing units.
(3)	Air Forces: 1 fighter wing, 1 light bomber wing, 1 troop carrier, 1 tactical control squadron, 1 tactical reconnaissance squadron.
•	b. Logistic requirements; Case I can be logistically supported without
particular difficulty. As the training of Indigenous forces is crucial to the success of this operation, the US must be prepared to support a training program for 330,000 Indigenous troops, an increase of 100,000 over present forces.
c.	Political aspects: The French would prefer a solution which did not involve US military participation, but would not seriously oppose same. The Associated States would welcome US intervention if given appropriate security guarantees. The Free World would generally support this action.
d.	Free World reaction to US tactical use of nuclear weapons: Our Allies would probably disapprove if nuclear weapons were used without their being consulted, but if consulted would generally approve their use tactically.
✓
e.	Soviet bloc reaction: Generally Soviet reaction would be the same as though the US were assuming unilateral responsibility. The chances < e about even that in this situation Communist China would decide upon overt intervention rather than accept the defeat of Viet Minh. If US use of nuclear weapons should lead to impending Viet Minh defeat, chances are better than even that the Chinese Communist would not openly intervene.
f.	Foreign aid considerations; Military assistance would continue at approximately current rates: i.e., FY-54, $800 million; FY-55, $1130 million. Economic assistance would be substantially increased over present rate of $25 million per year.	•
4.	Alternative B: In concert with the French and others.
a.	Military requirements: Same as in Case 1, although allied air or naval forces might substitute for US forces.

J Ui
b.	Political aspects: While it might be possible to secure UN action for armed assistance to the Associated States, It would be difficult to stave off pressure for a negotiated settlement or UN mediation. It would be possible to develop a regional grouping with maximum Asian participation if it were clear that the US had decided to commit forces to the area. France would prefer a regional grouping to UN sponsored assistance. The Associated States would prefer UN sponsored assistance. The Free. World reaction would be somewhat more favorable to action as a part of a regional grouping than to US unilateral action.
c.	Reaction to US use of nuclear weapons: Same as Case I.
d.	Soviet bloc, reaction: Even though the US was participating as one of a regional group, the chances of overt Chinese Communist aggression would remain substantial.
e.	Foreign aid considerations: Expenditures would probably be greater than in Case .1 because the US would be called upon to support the forces of the additional participating states.
5.	Alternative C: US acting in concert with others or alone.
a.	Military requirements: Assuming no serious deterioration in the military situation prior to US take-over from the French of responsibility for military operations:
(1)	Ground Forces: Indigenous forces of 330,000; 6 Infantry and 1 Airborne Division of US or Allied troops, plus 275,000 support personnel.
(2)	Air Forces: 1 Fighter Wing, 1 Light Bomber wing, 1 Troop Carrier (Wing), 2 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons, 1 Fighter Bomber Wing and 1 Tactical Control Squadron.
(3)	Naval Forces: 1 Carrier Task Group, plus additional mining and support units.
b.	Logistic implications: Case III can bc supported without major logistical implications provided production schedules are maintained at approximately Korean War levels.
>
c.	Impact on US military programs: As this course would involve accepting an increased calculated risk of war with Communist China or cr general war, it would require a reversal of present policy planning to _e-duce the size of the US armed forces.
d.	Political aspects: French disassociation would enhance support for UN action or for a regional grouping. It would also end France's role as a major power. Most of the Free world would support- US intervention.
e.	Soviet bloc reaction: Same as in Case II.
f.	Foreign aid considerations: Same as in Case II, although savings in the US contribution for the support of French forces in Indochina would partially offset the greatly increased cost of US forces taking their place.

The basic decision confronting the United States in Southeast Asia is whether to cut our losses in that area and to gradually withdraw our commitments with the least possible loss of prestige or to implement fully the provisions of a policy calculated to guarantee the retention of the arca in the free world provided the U.S. is willing to take the full range of measures which are necessary to make its stated policy effective. If the U.S. is not willing to do the latter it may consider two possible alternatives to Communist control.
2.	Japanese Alternative. Recognizing the lack of decisive U.S. military objectives in Southeast Asia, the apathy of the indigenous people toward Communist encroachment, the improbability of any realistic Indian reaction to responsibility for Southeast Asia, to this end:
a.	assure the Japanese Government of U.S. willingness to acquiesce in a Japanese sphere of influence in Southeast Asia provided they will cooperate in preventing Communist control of the remainder of Southeast Asia by accelerating their rearmament program sufficiently to assume responsibilities there;
b.	divert a considerable proportion of MDAP funds programmed for Indochina to an offshore procurement program for Japan for the production of ground force weapons for Japanese and other free Asian forces;
c.	encourage maximum Japanese participation in organizations and programs designed to stimulate the economic growth of Southeast Asia.
3.	Indian Alternative. Recognizing the proximity of the Colombo powers in this region, stimulate, with U.S. support, Indian interest in and responsibility toward Southeast Asia, to this end:
a.	assure the Indian Government of U.S. willingness to support an Indian area of moral influence in Southeast Asia, provided they will act to prevent Communist control of the remainder of Indochina;
b.	utilize the Colombo economic development organization to stimulate the economic growth of Southeast Asia;
c.	utilize to the maximum Indian officials in assisting and advising the indigenous governments.

'	costs of certain regional militia units in Associated States military	_
m	budgets of which the first installment is estimated at $8 million and	t
(5) the additional costs of pacification of areas liberated by operation "Atlants" estimated at 200 million piasters ($5«7 million). These developments plus adjustments such as changes in force goals and con, sumption and initial provisioning requirements where known should be incorporated in. the cost study. However, it should be made clear that in revising the cost study based on tho known factors these areas more or less, tend to increase tha estimate. It is estimated that there are many unlcnpun areas that would, if known, in all probability reduce tha estimate considerably. With these revisions, the report of DC7E should be accepted as the best possible estimate of cost of tho Indochina, military operations until such time as the French and HAAG Saigon can provide improved experience factors and costs. From an overall standpoint, it should ba noted that HAAG Saigon has no basis for determining tho costs of the FY 1954 and FY 1955 UDA Program at this time. The MAAG feels that until such time as thc Frcnch inform them of future plans it is impossible to develop a. costing of the FY 1954 end FY 1955 Indochina operations. Thus, any estimates contained in thc. FY 1955 Budget and. Congressional presentations are illustrative only and in no way reflect what the costs for FY 1955 will bo.
GENERAT, RECO.-MEfDATIONS AND COHMERTS: The MAAG must ba given authority to review requisitions along tho line indicated in this report in order that they may no longer merely act as a transmission agency for French requisitions.
•	' When and if the French provide the required logistical data, the MAAG
must mako somo fundemental changes internally, designed to establish a system of supply control which will be geared toward thc screening of requirements. This vzill necessitate apeouar integration of the present record system with tho needs of the scroaning and review process, z
There is no question that requirements of the French and Associated States must be met, but the problem is one of providing sufficient equipment of the right type needed to support the military mission. Otherwise, both funds and effort will bo dissipated and the military mission weakened by providing equipment in excess of requirements or not of a. type that can be utilized. For example, 2094 rocket launchers 3.5" have been delivered along with 66,000 rounds of ammunition, and an additional 190,000 rounds programmed, vrbich tha French do not want or use. Without close liaison with the French in the planning and logistical phases, which will enable the HAAG to have an understanding of future operations, assets, and requirements, there will be continuous problems of an unbalanced supply situation and inadequate data for US logistical and funding planning.
•	An improved system of inspection of end use of MDAP equipment must
be developed. At prasent the MAAG is permitted 30 inspections of units a month. The MAAG must give 60 days notice of proposed units to be inspocted, which necessitates assuming that specific units will ba non-operational and at a given location 60 days in advance. Even when the schedule is approved by.the French, units to be inspected are made oparational without notifications to the ’L’,lG, who, upon arriving at the sits find thgt inspections cannot be accomplished because the unit was made operational. More fracdom" of choice of units to be inspected
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
■	must be worked out with the French. Because ths $385 million dollar
program includes pay and subsistence of forces of the Associated States, this problem of inspection becomes an even more acute area, since it is proposed that those units will to visited by the MAAG at least once a year to follow up on its implementation.
• The major reasons for the lack of program information and logistical back, up material within the HAAG are more or less a direct result of the following:	'	.	.
'	c
The MAAG membars have, in the past, been expected to be experts in ' relation to requirements for supplies and equipment to logistically support a war for which they have no part in the planning or execution. Not only do thay have no part in tha planning but the plans, i.f any, which are prepared by the French are not made Jmov:n to the HAAG for tha most part until after execution or on a crash basis. It is believed that the MAAG has made a valiant attempt based on the limited information provided then to screen and evaluate the requests for supplies and materiel in order to provide the necessary requirements to support the war. Due to the very limited justification presented with requisitions, it has in the past been incumbent upon the MAAG to ask the French for additional information prior to recommending approval to Washington. An example of a reply from thc French is shown in (Tabs A and Al). The Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, General Navarre, forwarded a letter (Tab B) to General Trapnell, Chief of the MAAG, which resulted in a cable being > forwarded from OSD Mash to the MAAG (Tab C). As a result of the above correspondence and General Navarre's discussion of the situation here with visiting US officials who have given him the inpression that all his requests will be granted, this attitude has filtered down tltrough General. Navarre’s staff to the point that they feel that an official request for equipment or assistance from the French High Command is sufficient justification, and that their needs should not be put to question. The MAAG, as a net result, has become to a great extent a transmission agency for requisitions for supplies and equipment except in those limited areas ’.there MAAG personnel are able to extract reasonable
•	justification from the French. In many cases the MAAG has recommended
disapproval of requests and the French have gone to higher authority and gained approval. A recent dispatch from the MAAG to Headquarters USAF in connection with French requests for aircraft support is attached (Tab D) as an illustration of the difficulties under which MAAG action is taken.
The following is a brief analysis of the problem areas and recommendations. It is believed that the following reconmendations are ■	essentials if the US is to furnish logistically support for the war
in Indochina in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.
EORCERASIS: Since the completion of the 6 February 1954 DOE cost study there have been a numbcr of changes in Force Pim objectives of * the Army, Navy and Air Force. Some of the changes ware under advisement at the time of the 6 February report and in those cases where considered

Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
firm were included in the study. There are indications that further changes are being considered by the French and/or Vietnamese which have not yet been officially communicated to the HAAG. For the most part changes as of this date will increase the cost estimates over those included in the original study although they are relatively minor when, compared to the overall force levels.
The logistical implications of those frequent changes are important. For example, since rid-January 19'54 the Country Team has become aetare of three different plans for the build-up of Standard Infantry Battalions and Light (Main (>.l?.n) Battelions in the Vietnamese Army. These plans are summarised as follows:
Inf an try Battalion (Stan- Light Battalion (K.Q.) dard)(T/O Personnel:829) (T/O Personnel: 640)

_P1?n A: Officially submitted to MAAG on 25 January 1954 as basis for "logistical planning. HAAG has submitted to JCS for approval. Probably in costing study base.

support of request for ch ergo MAAG has requested official
Plan C: Learned of through informal .sources on 2 April 1954«
The equipment required by a light battalion is significantly different from that required by a standard infantry battalion. Shifts in planning of this magnitude over such short periods of time could easily result in US furnishing equipment of the wrong type for the missions of forces that will actually be activated.
Attached is table F which illustrates the utilization of assighed aircraft. As you trill note in the table of the total F-8-F aircraft assigned, only are operational or projected to be oparational at any one time. Likewise, for the E-2o, only 95/ of the total assigned aircraft are operational or projected to be operational at any one time.
RECOMEl'D.ATION: While it is recognized that a fluid situation requires changes in planning, the necessity of keeping MAAG fully and promptly informed of changes in thinking should be stressed to the French. Further, force plans and T/O’s should be stabilized to the maximum extent permitted by the military situation as soon as possible in order to permit orderly and effective logistical support.
REQUIREMENTS: The MAAG has available for the most part, tables of organization and equipment for major Army tactical, units but they are not available for most sector or static units. Were T/O—2s are
Declassified per Executive Order 13526. Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
'available initial requirements have been computed by the cost study team. The Air Force- and the Navy have T/O&Es for a limited number, of units, but the MAAG does not accept them as firm enough to bp a basis for recluil'-monts computations. The T/O-Es available represent a small segment of the total materiel requirements. Therefore, the Army, Navy, and Air Force have been accepting raqui.rernnts as stated by the French except in those cases ’there sufficient information is available to modify the requests.
Table (1) attached is a comparison of requirements and assets indicating the incomplete nature of the requirements data available to the K'.AG. For some items such as rifles, heavy machine gun, recoilless rifle, 6O.wn mortal’, all trucks, armored cars M-3, personnel carriers half track, and most signal equipment, the requirements are loss than assets, as much as 90)6 in some cases. No data is available as to the basis for the requirements for the difference between tha T/OABs and the stated assets. Similarly, it is impossible to determine whether there are additional requirements for those end itm.es where requirements exceed assets. Would all the require-meats be met if the apparent deficiency were funded? Tha MAAG is in no position to answer that question or to provide an answer as to the definitive requirements which must still be met.
KECOMNEiDATIONS: United States i-ilitary experienced logistic and planning officers be. assigned to General Navarre’s staff in an advisory capacity in order to determine logistic requirements for projected programmed operations. If it is not possible to assign US personnel to the French Staff then it is imperative that the US logistic officers be kept informed of the plannod operations in order to effectively and efficiently support those operations. Furthermore, the French and the FUAG should meet and agree on approved T/O-zEs for all units including tactical, sector and static units, and the MAAG must be advised immediately of changes or revisions to the approved T/OAEs.
INVENTORIES: No firm information is available on actual inventory positions as of any given date ana actual deliveries from IIDAP are not known in many areas. The Air Force, for example, does not have actual delivery informa*. tion on FDAP ammunition. This is due to such things as: (1) lio manifest being forwarded with shipments; (2) shipments arriving and unloading with” out knowledge of MAAG, etc. No information is available as to French contributions of end items or deliveries from off-shore procurement. The inventories ap submitted by the French for the cost study Vary as much 5'0/ plus or minus from the inventories contained in the MAAG records.
As illustrated in Table 1, the status of inventories is not firm. The table compares asset data as of 31 December 1903 available at the MAG with that presented by the French in their Paris report to DCS. There is no consistent pattern or explanation as to the variation existing etween the two sets of stated assets, -since for some itcms such as the carbine and Bham mortar the FAAG assets are double those stated by the French, while for the rifle and light machine gun, for example, the French indicate assets double those stated by the HAAG. It should be recognised that the MAAG does not provide for combat losses or for OSP and indigenous financed shipnants of end items to Indochina. This table indicates that without the complete knowledge	•	•	*

•.	of assets, the lt-AG nay approve end item requests bar cd on their Unite:! .
• - ascot data when in. reality they may be in long supply, or vics versa.
■	A further complication to the end item inventory problem ie
conteirod in tha lkroreeliun of Understanding betv/soa tho US,and tho Franck with xualation to the C3S5 million aid program to the Associated STA^cs. Tho llomorendtui permits expenditures for armaments notoriaod ciquijatont, communications equipment, and engineering equipment for the A sobiated. States cut of the 0385 million. It is ’estimated that $70 million waill bo for ustoriol, which will not ba controlled, by tho MAAG. Thus, if tho MAAG rojocts a request for 1IDAP end itom aid, thoro is nothing to prevent tho ASSOCIATod States from procuring that item out of tha S38y ttillics program. FUSTHemore, tho MAAG would havs, if tho present ctato of logistical confusion continues, no information as to the materiel on order from the $385 million or that which is stocked as a result of tho $385 million.
RE CO: ARNDAc-I OHS: Tho MAAG immediately bring thoir records un to data in relation to what equipment and supplies have actually boon shipped to Indochina unicr all programs and what is planned to bo shipped by clato. This will necessitate complete cooperation of all Dsparteent of Defense . agencies in the US and France with MAAG Saigon.	.	,
A request bo made to tho French to furnish to the HAAG all known ansois, including materiel from France, off-shore procurement and materiel ' to bo procured, from tho $385 million Associated States aid program. Thoso . stated assets, in turn, must bo reconciled with the liAAG records in order io provide a firm basis for computing futuro requirements.
COlISUMPTIOW: The latest information available) to the HAAG on actual Army consumption is contained in a French report dated April 1953 for tho calendar year 1952 vhich doos not take account of the major increased effort since that period. Ythcn consumption information is furnished to tho HAAG it is usually on a crash basis for tho purpose of justifying air lift of additional supplies. Experience has shown that the Frcnch are requesting natoriol on a crash basis when they a.ctually have sufficient quantities in their own dopots but cay it is much easier to •	have tho US air lift additional quantities than to redistribute the
• material .within Indochim?.. Thin in particularly true in the case of . ammunition. Sometime during the month of April, thc French will tn nit another list of consumption factors, but those will ba based on CY 1953 and. ’.rill not reflect tho full impact of the Navarro Plan or tho present fighting at Dicn Bien Phu.
• KSOONNEinIA?^ That tho French be requested to provide empericncad consumption rates cn all typos of equipment and supplies on a monthly recurring basis, or whatever basis is reasonable within their capability.
STOCK LEVELS - OPEPATIOFAL RESERVE: Inasmuch ae tho assets, consumption and receipts aro more or less unknoatn, it is not possible for tha NAAG to detoraine what stock levels or operational resorvus arc being maintained in depots, nor the amount of eervicoablo and reparable oquinnant in depots, or tho amount of equipment in the hands of troops. Thore are

Eowove:-?, tho ntook 1 ovals for tho bulk, of the supplies and equipment cannot bo dotoiuincd or reconciled to any cpccific levol. Tha 1Z1AG in their ccment on the cost study stated that th? Pronoh must have.at least a sin—:ao:.’.th ntoek level of supplies in the theater. However, tha NAAG was unablo to state in specific tores what actually constituted a ni::-month lovol or what constitutes any militarily satisfactory lovol for Inlobhina.
In tho army rn-nunition area, as noted in Table II, if tho current high consumption rates continue, a shortage of 60 mm mortar shells and 105 J’u howitnor shells uill occur, while present lDllP programming will result in an ovorsupnly of 30 caliber carbine cartridges, 57 riflo sheila, and 155mm howitsor shells. With available c—wn’entiem data, rough requirca-cuts can bo clovolppod to servo as a basis for logistical planning to urovent tho orach approach that has bean noobssery recently. While some conaidoration must la given to tho 1H.AG position that lacking data on the opsiv.tion?,! plans of tho Frcnch, it is impossible to state what constitutor a definitive operation?.?. level, ostinatos for planning purposes arc still ncoossary and, cm be undo based on ths availablo consu^tion data.
11100'1:1:^	Tho Frcnch should bo requcst?:! to furnish thc HAAG the
quantity and location of stock levels and operational xcnorvea currently maintained by typo of equipment and supply and what is projected.
The levels of supply required in Indochina are"dependent on the extent of logistical back-up outside tho thoator, the capabilities of tho login-tical organisation in Indochina and such other factors as transportation and oomunioation facilitios v/ithin tho theater. It is rocoumondc'-d that qualified logistical porsonnol be assigned to make a ntv.dy of tho logistical cupport situation in. Indochina in order to dotornino what lovals are required in thc thoator to support tho oporation.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject; U.S. Reaction to Chinese Communist Introduction of Air Power in Indochina
1.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed a memorandum by Department of State Representatives, dated 12 March 1954, subject as above, tabled at the 12 March 1954 State-JCS meeting. In substance, this memorandum requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to present their views on the military significance and implications of the following:
a. The appearance of, and Communist capability of maintaining and supplying, an air force using only airfields in Viet Nam or Laos in the face of French opposition.
_b. The appearance of, and Communist capability of mounting, an air force based principally on airfields in Communist China, and how large a force would be required to counter Frcnch defense capabilities.
2.	In regard to subparagraph 1 a., above, there are no indications that the Viet Minh currently possess an air force. Therefore, the appearance of combat aircraft in Minh would warrant the assumption that they were supplied by and operated from Communist China. It is estimated that the Communists, in the fac.e of current French capabilities, could not maintain and supply an air force operating exclusively from airfields in Viet Nam or Laos.
3.	In regard to subparagraph 1 _b, above, the Communists have the capability of mounting a ersious air threat to the French with an airforce based principally in South Cina. The French air defense of the Indochina area is inadequate. Consequently, a Communist air force of from 100-200 aircraft (including jet bombers) could readily overcome French air strength in the Tonkin delta and severely affect other French strengths in Indochina.	*

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. ROBERT CUTLER
SUBJECT: The Aircraft Carrier "Belleau Wood"
1.	On the 23rd of May, 1953, France requested the loan of an additional aircraft carrier for use in the Indochina theatre. They asked that the ship be turned over to them on 1 Octobrt. Accordingly, the President on 26 August, 1953, under the terms of P.L.188, 83d Congress, approved the loan of the "Belleau Wood" to France effective on or about 5 September, 1953.
2.	The US Navy actually transferred the ship to the French on 5 September, 1953, but, owing to France’s delay in supplying a full crew, she did not arrive in France until about 24 December, approximately two and one-half months later than originally scheduled.
3.	Latest reports indicate that thc "Belleau wood" was scheduled to sail
from Toulon on 7 April, 1954, to begin her first tour in the Indochina theatre. Enroute she will deliver 32 French-built "Ouragon" jet aircraft to the Indian Air Force at Bombay. It is estimated that it will take her approximately one month to make the voyage from France to Indochina with a stop at Bombay to unload the jets. Furthermore, when she arrives in the Gulf of Tonkin she will relieve the carrier "Arromanche" which will return to France. MAAG Paris points out that if the Ouragon’s were unloaded and replaced by one and possibly two available Corsair squadrons it would bc possible to keep both the "Belleau wood" and .the "Arromanche" in the Indochina combat. There is no indication, however, that the French Navy is considering such action.
4.	The French government's sale of French-built jets to India is particularly interesting. At the same time these jets were being built, we have been delivering, as a part of our military assistance program for France which at the end of FY 1953 had exceeded a total of 3.8 billion dollars, US jets to
France in order to help them meet their NATO force goals. (we have already
given them more than 700 jets.)
5.	In view of the current crisis in Indochina, the repeated frantic French requests for additional US aircraft, and the recent proposal by Pleven

that the US provide a large carrier and aircraft of types familiar to French pilots for French air strikes in support of the Dien Bien Phu battle (see attached cable) it would appear that:
p. The French will have had the "Belleau Wood" a whole year without making use of her in the fight for Indochina.
P. She is currently being used as a delivery wagon rather than as a combat vessel.
p. Despite France’s urgent need for additional fighter aircraft in NATO and in Indochina the French will manage to find time to build, sell and deliver 32 jets to India.

SUBJECT: NSC Action No. 1086-a, b and c
REFERENCE: Planning Board Report on NSC Action No. lO74-p, dated 5 April 1954
1. At its meeting on 6 April 1954, the National Security Council agreed on the following, which has been subsequently approved by the President (NSC Action No. 1086-n, b and p) :
'	a. Noted and discussed the reference report and postponed

V. Agreed that the United States should direct its efforts prior to the Geneva Conference toward:
(1)	Organizing a regional grouping, including initially thc U.S., the U.K., France, the Associated States,
•	Australia, Ncw Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines,
for the defense of Southeast Asia against Communist
' efforts by any means to gain control of the countries in this area.
(2)	Gaining British support for U.S. objectives in the Far East, in order to strengthen U.S. policies in the area.
■	(3) Pressing the French to accelerate the program for the
independence of the Associated States.	.
p. Noted the President’s view that, if agreement for the organization of the above-mentioned regional grouping could be achieved Congressional authorization for U.S. participation therein should then be requested.

2.	The action set forth in paragraph 1-p above has been referred to the Secretary of Defense and the Director, Office of Defense Mobilization for appropriate implementation and was discussed at the Armed Forces Policy Council on 15 April 1954. The action in paragraph 1-.b was referred to the Secretary of State.
3.	It is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff promptly prepare the military plans involved under paragraph 1-a above. It is further requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in close collaboration, under existing arrangements, with the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Assistant Secretaries of Defense (Supply and Logistics), (Manpower and Personnel) and (Cpmptroller), promptly develop the supply, manpower and other requirements arising from these military plans which might affect production, manpower and budgetary planning by the Department of Defense and the Office of Defense Mobilization. This military planning and the development of requirements should cover not only specific intervention in Indochina, but also any augmentations in forces or supplies required to permit the United States to maintain at present levels its present defense commitments and to be prudently prepared to face possible increased risks of (1) Chinese Communist intervention and (2) general war.	•
4.	It is further requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff report to my office on the above by 10 May 1954. If it has not been possible to complete the planning by that date, a progress report on 10 May 1954 is requested.
5.	The Assistant Secretaries of Defense (Supply and Logistics) and (Manpower and Personnel) will collaborate with the Office of Defense Mobilization, as appropriate, in the preparation of production and manpower plans based upon and required to implement the military plans.
5.	• Because of the security sensitivity of this planning, appropriate security precautions will be taken by all concerned.

Dear Alex:
This Department is becoming increasingly concerncd regarding the lack of a U.S. position in preparation for the Indochina phase of the Conference to be held at Geneva. I fully appreciate the difficulties which, up until this time, have made it very difficult to draft a position on Indochina. However, in-view of the short time remaining until thc Conference convenes at Geneva, it is essential that consideration be given to the U.S. position.
It appears to me that ample guidance is available to provide the basis for an initial draft of a U.S. Government position on Indochina for Geneva. NSC 5405 as well as reports of the Special Committee set forth, in positive terms, U.S. policy with respect to Indochina and Southeast Asia. At the meetings of the Indochina Working Group the need for a U.S. position on Indochina has been discussed at considerable length, but to date no progress has been made. In order to initiate action on a draft position, the Dcfense representatives at the working level submitted an outline of views to the State members of the Indochina working Group. A copy of this paper is attached for your information.
In view of the foregoing I strongly recommend that immediate action be taken to draft a U.S. position paper on Indochina for the Conference at Geneva. I would be glad to discuss this matter further at your convenience or at a meeting of the Assistant Secretaries.
Sincerely yours,
For the..Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA) :

United States objectives in Southeast Asia, a continuation of fighting with the objective of seeking a military victory appears as the only alternative in Indochina. (JCS memorandum, TAB A).
Conclusions
If the Communists follow the same tactics they employed at Panmunjom, they will be prepared for a long and difficult negotiation. The French will find it almost impossible to withstand presures for a weakening of their position (the Laniel proposal) and will most likely give way under these pressures. Further, the French, once engaged in a negotiation, will of necessity be required to seek every possible means of settlement.
Thc United States should not join with the French in any Indochina negotiations at Geneva unless there is prior French commitment not to accept terms leading directly or indirectly to the loss of Indochina. This commitment should be positive and definite, for it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to disassociate itself from the negotiations once they had begun. Thus, if the negotiations result in a settlement leading to the ultimate loss of Indochina, the United States would have participated in this loss.
Recommendations
It is recommended that:
a.	The United States adopt the position that it is highly improbable that the Communist agreement could be obtained to a negotiated settlement at Geneva which would be consistent with basic United States objectives in Southeast Asia;
b.	The United States position for Gencva be positive and definite that we will agree to no settlement which would in any way compromise our objectives with respect to Southeast Asia;
c.	The French Government be informed of the United States position (a and b above) at 'the earliest possible date;
d.	Concurrently with informing the French of the United States position, consideration should also be given to the following pressures to be brought on the French if circumstances dictate:
(1)	If France through one means or another countenances a Communist takeover in Indochina, it will mean far more than the end of France’s position in the Far East. Rather it will be a public ex- . hibition of France’s inability to carry on any longer as an equal member with the United States and the United Kingdom of the Big Three;
(2)	The effect of abandonment would be so severe in North Africa as to have serious repercussions not only on the French position there, but also on the nature of the relationship between France and the United States in that area;

1.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff lack verified logistical information, including the comments of the Chief, MAAG, Indochina in regard to feasibility of the aid requested by the French. This information has been requested as soon as possible.
2.	Pending receipt of such data and comments from Chief, MAAG, Indochina, which may materially alter the observations on feasibility which follow, the comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the French request are indicated below:
p. From the viewpoint of military effectiveness the proposal offers little insofar as relief of Dien Bien Phu is concerned.
P. It would appear that the psychological aspect could be satisfied by confining the operation to one field only— that at Seno.
p. The Seno airfield appears also to be the only one in which rehabilitation and preparation are feasible within anything like the timing proposed. Preparation of the two other fields included in the French requcst would require from 2 to 4 weeks and greatly increased supply, logistic and construction effort.
R. It should be pointed out that thc proposal is by no means a "one shot" affair but represents a continuing logistic supply requirement of no small proportions with a corresponding reduction of the airlift capabilities of CINCFE.

p. The matter of local defense of the fields, when operational, adds to the continuing logistic supply effort.
f.	The project, even reduced to consideration of the one field at Seno, unqucstionably involves continuing participation of U.S. military forces in active operations. The prospects of disengaging them appear remote if the fields are to remain in active operation, as the capabilities of the French to takc on the continuing supply effort are questionable. In fact, the probability of continuing and expanded participation by U.S. military personnel is high. Increased risk of U.S. personnel casualties is also involved.
g.	The question resolves itself really to whether or not we are, under the guise of a last minute effort to relieve Dien Bien Phu to commence active participation by U.S. forces in the Indochina war.
h.	with regard to the furnishing of privateer aircraft this request can be handled through regular MDAP channels, but expedited. The first ten airplanes.are now being assembled and prepared, and air delivery to Saigon will be expedited. The additional ten can be provided at a later date.
3. In summary:
p. Employment of U.S. planes and crews, and GOA and supervisory construction personnel, on missions stated, would have the following major military consequences:
(1)	Involve U.S. Armed Forces in direct participation in military operations in Indochina.
‘	•	i
(2)	Mounting scale of U.S. Armed Forces participation due to requirements for local security, and increasing demands for combat and service support for both U.S. and French forces.
(3)	Greatly increased risk of U.S. personnel casualties due to enemy action, including capture.
(4)	Some increased risk of armed intervention by Communis t Chinese forces.
b. within the approximate time limits suggested, the rehabilitation and extension of the field at Seno appears to be feasible.

p. From the military viewpoint, insofar as relief of Dien Bien Phu is concerned, the project is of little value.
T- Psychological aspects might well be satisfied by confining projects to the field at Seno only.
p. Maintaining Seno field operational would require a continuing supply effort of considerable proportions.
f. Local defense of field and any ground line of communications would have to be increased to counter Viet Minh guerrilla operations which would increase with the added importance of the airfield.
4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider* that:
p. From a military viewpoint, the proposal of the French, except for supply of naval aircraft, should be rejected.
b. If, for other than military reasons, the proposal is approved, the U.S. commitment should be limited to rehabilitation and extension of the Seno airfield.

TRE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.
30 April 1954
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Suspension of U.S. Military Aid to Indochina in Event of a Cease Fire.
1.	The possibility exists that a cease fire in Indochina may be agreed upon either at Geneva or unilaterally between the French and the Viet Minh. In that event, the Viet Minh would likely covertly extend thcir control over large areas currently held by French Union Forces and cause major defections of these forces. This would result in a quick deterioration of the entire French Union position and enable thc Viet Minh to seize large amounts of U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP) materiel and supplies. '
2.	In light of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it necessary that the United States adopt the following position reference future MDAP assistance to Indochina:
In the event of a cease fire in Indochina, the shipment of military end items under U.S. MDAP provided under the "Agreement for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina between the United States of America and Cambodia, France, Laos, and Vietnam," will immediately be suspended, except forfor such spares and associated maintenance items necessary
to the maintenance of equipment in operations. The entire question of U.S. aid to Indochina will be re-examined in the light of circumstances then existing.
3.	It is the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the "Agreement for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina between the United States of America and Cambodia, France, Laos, and Vietnam," of 23 December 1950, provides adequate legal basis for subject suspension.
4.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that you secure governmental acceptance of the position proposed in paragraph 2 above.

CONSEQUENCES WITHIN INDOCHINA OF
THE PROBLEM
PHU-
To estimate the probable consequences within Indochina during the next two or three months of the fall of Dien Bien Phu within the near future.
SCOPE
The consequences of the fall of Dien Bien Phu on the political situation in France,, and the repercussions of major decisions in France or Geneya on the situation in Indochina, are excluded from the scope of this estimate.	% *
CONCLUSIONS
1. The fall of Dien Bien Phu would have far-reaching and adverse repercussions, but it would not signal the immediate collapse of the French Union politicaI ' and military situation in Indochina. As a consequence of the fall of Dien Bien Phu, the morale of French Union forces would receive a severe blow. A crucial ■ factor in the military situation thereafter would be the reliability of native units, particularly the Vietnamese. There wouId almost certainly be increased desertions, and the possibility cannot be excluded that the native components of French Union forces might disintegrate. However, we believe that such disintegration would be unlikely during the ensuing two or three months, and that for at least this period the major part of the ■ native troops would probably remain loyal.
. 2. Assuming no such disintegration, the fall of Dien Bien Phu wouId not in itself substantially alter the relative military capabilities of French Union and Viet Minh forces in Indochina during the next ' two or three months. The French stand at Dien Bien Phu has produced certain compensatory military results. It has prevented an overrunning of Laos and has resuIted in the inflicting of casualties upon the Viet Minh comparable in number to the total French force committed at Dien Bien Phu. The bulk of Viet Minh forces released by the fall of Dien Bien Phu would probably not be able to move, regroup, and re-equip in time to be employed in new major operations during the next two or three months, although some lightly equipped infantry battalions might be macle available more rapidly .for operations in the Delta region. •

3.	Although the Viet Minh have a substantial capability to organize demonstrations and carry out sabotage and terrorist activities in the major cities of Indochina, we believe that French Union forces couId maintain control in those cities.
4.	The political cOnsequences in Indochina of the fall of Dien Bien Phu would be considerably more adverse than the strictly military consequences and would increase the tempo of deterioration in the over-all French Union position in Indochina, particularly in Vietnam. There would probably be a serious decline in
■j the Vietnamese will to continue the war [and to support the Vietnamese military i programs. However, we believe that general collapse of French and native gov’ ernmental authority during the next two
or three months would be prevented by the continued existence of organized French Union forces and the hope among Indochinese that the US might interyene in Indochina.
5.	We believe that although the fall of Dien Bien Phu would'not. immediately lead to colIapse of the French UniOn pbsi-tion in Indochina, it would accelerate the deterioration already evident in the French Union military and political position there. If this trend were not check-cd, it could bring about a collapse of the French Union pOsition during the latter half of 1954. It should be emphasized that this estimate does not consider the repercussion of major decisions in France or Geneva and elsewhere, which cculd’ have a decisive effect on the situation in Indochina.
D1SCUSS1ON
6.	We believe that thc fall of Dien Bien Phu, if it occurred as assumed in the problem, would result from: (a) French capitulation; or (b) an overwhelming of thc French cither by assault of by gradual constriction of the French position. .
' 7. If the French were to capitulate without further heavy fighting, the adverse military • and political consequences would be essentially similar in kind, though possibly of greater intensity, to those accompanying the fall of the fortress through heavy fighting. Viet Minh losses in thc event of capitulation would be less than those which would be incurred during further heavy fighting.
8.	In any event, the Viet Minh would have suffered heavy losses in the prolonged righting at Dien Bien Phu. Estimated Vict Minh casualties in thc fighting there to date are approximately 13,000; roughly 50 percent of this number have been killed or rendered perma-
nently ineffective. Although a few experienced units have been sent as reinforcements, individual replacements for the most part have consisted of partially trained personnel. As a result of the Dien Bien Phu operation, the effectiveness of the Viet Minh offensive striking force will be greatly reduced during the next two or three months. |
9.	French Union casualties at D n Bien Phu to date have been approximately 5,500. The defeat of thc force now at Dien Bien Phu would add another 11,000, thus ringin0 the total French Union losscs to roughly 17,000. At least two-thirds of these troops are exoeri-enced, professional units from Algerian colonial and foreign legion forces. Moreover, six of the thirteen parachute battalions in the French Union forces in Indochina are at Dien Bien Phu. The lo'ss of these elite French Union troops would reduce the French Union offensive striking force by approximately one-

quarter, thus markedly reducing over-all French Union capabilities for offensive opera-tions in Indochina.
. 10. As a consequence of the fall of Dien Bien Phu, the morale of the French Union forces would receive a severe blow. Their will to win would be diminished, largely because of a A' \widespread belief that military victory was no
.longer possiblc. The loss of morale would probably not bo sufficient to reduce thc effectiveness of the professional soldiers of the French Expeditionary force. However, a cru-cial factor in thc military situation thereafter would be the reliability of native units, par-ticularly the Vietnamese. There would al-most certainly be an increase in Vietnam desertions, and thc possibility cannot- be ex-cludcd that thc native components of French Union forces might disintegrate. However, we believe that such disintegration would be unlikely during the ensuing two or three months, and that for at least this period the major . . part of the native troops would probably re-
main loyal Therefore, we estimate that the • impact upon thc morale of the French Union forces would be severe, but not of such severity as to preclude their employment as an eftec-tive military force during thc next two or three months.
11.	The f?.H of Dien Bien Phu would not in itself substantially alter thc relative military capabilities of French Union and Viet Minh forces in Indochina during the next two or three months unless there were large-scale desertions from the French Union forces. The victorious Viet Minh troops at Dien Bien Phu would have suffered heavy casualties and their efficiency would be reduced. In order to bring these forccs up to full strength, the Viet Minh would probably move them from Dien Bien Phu to their main supply and training areas adjacent to the Red River delta. Prior to the rainy season, this redeployment would require at least three to four weeks. After thc full onset of the rainy season, which is unlikely before mid-May, thc movement would take be-tween two and three months to complete. We therefore- estimate that the bulk of the Viet Minh troops at Dien Bien Phu would not be available for major operations elsewhere in
Indochina during the next two or three months, although some lightly-equipped infantry battalions might be made available morc rapidly for operations in the Delta rc-gion.
12.	Although the over-all capabilities of the Viet Minh would bc reduccd as a consequence of the losses indicted upon their main striking force, Viet Minh forccs elsewhere in Indochina would have thc capability during thc rainy season to maintain and in some in-stances increase military pressure against French Union forces. In the Red River delta, they could intensify efforts to sever land com-munications between Hanoi and Haiphong, ambush French detachments, attack villages, air bases, and other installations, and lay siege to isolated French delta strong points. The scalc of Viet Minh operations in thc Delta, however, would be restricted by the adverse effects of heavy rains on maneuver-ability. Thc Viet Minh could use their force concentrated in thc Pleiku region in southern Annam to launch fairly large-scale attacks ' against French forces engaged in the “Atlante” operation. They could also use units from this force for raiding operations in the Mekong River area or to reinforce the Viet Minh battalions now in Cambodia. Com-bat operations in southern Annam, the Me-kong valley, and in Cambodia would be re-stricted by the tenuous nature of resupply of ammunition and other military equipment for these units. The Viet Minh could at the same time organize demonstrations and carry out sabotage and terrorist activities in the major cities of Indochina. The Viet Minh capability in this regard is probably sub-stantial.
13.	French Union forces, assuming no major Vietnamese defections, would have the capa-bility to maintain their present major forti-fied positions in the Delta, and elsewhere, maintain control in the major cities, prevent • the permanent severing of land communica-tions between Hanoi and Haiphong, repulse Viet Minh, attacks in southern Annam and the Mekong River area, and retain the area liberated in the “Atlante” operation. If, the Viet Minh were to undertake a major military

operation against Cambodia, the defense of Cambodia would require troops from other areas. French Union forces would retain the capability to launch limited offensive opera-tions before the full onset of the rainy season, either in the. Red River delta region or on the coast of Annam.
14.	The political consequences in Indochina of the fall of Dien Bien Pint would be con-siderably more adverse than the strictly military consequences, although thc two are in-terrelated. The defeat would increase the tempo of deterioration in the over-all French Union position in Indochina, particularly in Vietnam. The principal political consequences would be: (a) a major blow to French prestige ■ among the Indochinese, and an increased •conviction on thcir part that the French were . unable to protect them against thc Viet Minh;
(b) a serious’ decline in French and Indo-Chinese will to continue thc war, and in par-ticular a further decline in popular support . in Vietnam for Vietnamese military pro-grams; (c) exacerbation of French-Indochinese relations, partly as a result of in-creased Indochinese suspicions that thc French will “sell out” to the Viet Minh; (d) a sharp increase of “fense sitting’' among politically conscious groups previously dis-posed to support the Vietnam Government;
’ and (e) a sharp increase, particularly among Vietnamese, of covert support of the Viet Minh. However, we believe that a general collapse of French and native governmental authority during the next two or three months would be prevented by the continued existence of organized French Union forces and
thc hope that thc US might intervene in In-dochina.
15.	Thc political effect in Laos would probably be similar to that of Vietnam. However, thc Laotians would probably display a greater disposition than the Vietnamese to stand by the French and tQ continue the war effort.
16.	The political effect on Cambodia would be extremely uncertain. The internal security of Cambodia and a certain minimum stability might be maintained, but Cambodia’s vulnera-bility to future Viet Minh pressure would increase.
17.	The Viet Minh would make every effort to make political capital of their victory at Dien Bien Phu. They would concentrate on in-creasing thc sense of hopelessness in the Associated States, and would seek to convince the Indochinese that thc triumph at Dien Bien Phu signalled their imminent “deliverance”' from colonial rule by fellow countrymen. They would intensify current efforts to en-hance the status of the so-called “People’s Governments” of Laos and Cambodia.
18.	We believe that although the fall of Dien Bien Phu would not immediately Jead to collapse of the French Union position in' Indochina, it would accelerate the deterioration already evidcnt in the French Union military and political position there. If this trend were not checked, it could bring about a collapse of the French Union position during the latter half of 1954. It should be emphasized that this estimate does not consider the repercussion of major decisions in France or Geneva and elsewhere which are likely to have a decisive effect on the situation h Indochina.

INDOCHINA
The following are comments made by Major General Thomas J. H. Trapnail, Junior, former Chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) Indochina, at his debriefing, 3 May 1954.
GENERAL
The battle of Indochina is an armed revolution which is now in its eighth year. It is a savage conflict fought in a fantastic country in which the battle may be waged one day in waist-deep muddy rice paddies or later in an impenetrable mountainous jungle. The sun saps the vitality of friend and foe alike, but particularly the European soldier. Torrential monsoon rains turn the delta battleground into a vast swamp which no conventional vehicle can successfully negotiate. It is a war of many paradoxes -
where there is no popular will to win on the part of the Vietnamese.
Where the leader of the Rebels is more popular than the Vietnamese Chief of State.
where a sizeable French army is composed of relatively few Frenchmen.
where the partners of the Associated States regard each other as more dangerous than the enemy.
where a large segment of the population seeks to expel the French at any price, possibly at the cost of extinction as a new nation.
This is a war which has no easy and immediate solution, a politico-military chess game in which the players sit thousands of miles distant — in Paris, washington, Peiping, and Moscow.
STRATEGIC POSITION OF INDOCHINA
The autonomous Associated States of Indochina consist of Viet Nam, Laos, and Cambodia. They occupy a blocking position against the expansion of Chinese Communist influence along the principal routes of communication in Southeast Asia. If this area, approximately the size of the state of Texas, defects or is neutral-ized the frontiers of Burma, Thailand and Malaya would immediately be exposed and eventually the positions of Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Indonesia and the Philippines would be weakened. A state of Civil war presently exists in Indochina, which pits the Communist Viet Minh against French Union forces essentially deveoted to the ideals of freedom. Other issues, such as varieties of Nationalism, are involved as well. Moreover, a state of transition is concurrently underway in which a formerly strong Colonial power is crumbling. France is giving way to a self-determination movement by the indigenous peoples, who, while numbering more than 30 million, lack stability and security. The population of the three states is not completely compatible in matters of economics.

culture, religion, ethnic origins, philosophy or political goals. Therefore, a compromise position has been reached in which the principal state of Viet Nam, combining the former protectorates of Annam and Tonkin with the ex-colony of Cochin China, has entered into a loose state of alliance with the lesser states of Laos and Cambodia, and with France. This federation is called the French Union. The exact relationship of each autonomous state to France has as yet not been completely determined. This indecision is, moreover, complicated by natural rivalries existing among the states, even extending to political tribal groups within the states.
The topography of Indochina is varied and consists of extensive mountains, jungles, rivers, canals and major deltas. A remarkable compartmentation results. Military operations in a given area may be conducted with almost complete disregard of the situation in the adjacent compartment. While essentially the ground war presently is the dominant military activity, great potentials in amphibious, naval and air warfare by French Union Forces exist which should be exploited increasingly. Poor internal communications and 1,599 miles of coastline are factors dictating the advisability of utilizing more effectively the combat power of the combined arms.
The political situation in France and Indochina requires a complicated system of military administration. Four national armies comprise the French Union Ground Forces. The French Far East Territorial Force, numbering roughly 1 million troops, equals the combined totals of the three indigenous armies, of which only that of Viet Nam may be considered as significant. Military responsibility is being delegated to the Associated States to the degree that their state of military development and capabilities so warrant. The pentalateral agreement of 23 December 1950 is the authority for existing relationships. The United States is a signatory to this document which extends MDAP into Indochina. Significantly, the conflict in Indochina has not been "internationalized" such as in Korea. Of the French Union partners, only France is a member of the United Nations., France has specifically opposed UN intervention on the presumption that its control of the Union would eventually be weakened by UN participation. On the enemy-side, the rebel army of 300,000 troops could not be supported without the substantial aid presently provided by Red China.
GOVERNMENT OF INDOCHINA	. ’
<
The prosecution of the war against the Viet Minh in Indochina is a joint responsibility of the sovereign governments of Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos and France, under the leadership and direction of the latter. The local representative of the French Government is the Commissioner General, M. De Jean. He represents M. Marc Jacquet, French Minister of State, in charge of relations with ^he Associated States. The Ministers of the Associated States, the French commissioner General and the military Commander in Chief, Lt General Henri Navarre, prescribe the conduct of the war. Existing protocols define the degree of military control enjoyed by the Commander in Chief over the armed forces of the individual Associated States. Essentially, the French exercise operational control over all forces in strategy and tactics. Each of the Associated States maintains a Chief of Staff and a General Staff who are primarily concerned with recruiting, training, personnel actions and limited logistical activities. The long range program envisages a progressive turnover of responsibilities to the Associated States, although a requirement exists that adequate coordinating powers be vested in the hands of the French for many years to come.

Political decisions affecting military operations are reached in sessions of the high committee by representatives of.the States, France, and the Commander in Chief. Essentially military problems are resolved in a permanent military committee in which the military chiefs of the Associated States together with the Commanding General of Headquarters, Joint and Ground Forces, Far East, participate.
Although a quadruplication of facilities exist in the form of several national general staffs and territorial organizations, actually a reasonably efficient channel of command is maintained by the French. Diplomatic liaison with the States counterpart organizations is exercised wherever coordination is required. This highly complex arrangement of joint and combined staffs and pooling of national forces may be likened to a miniature NATO at war, except that by necessity, the senior and more professionally qualified partner, France, exercises the dominant role. The governmental structure of each state is more or less oriented toward support of the war against Communism and the principal portion of each State’s budget is devoted to defense expenditures. Viet Nam is the most vigorous state in this regard. Laos is cooperative to the French, but without sizeable resources of men or money. Cambodia views the entire struggle as secondary to what it considers more important, the determination of future relationships among the States themselves. In consideration of the fact that hostilities are more or less normal in the life of the Indochinese, the States may be considered as mobilized for war, although with less dislocation to private enterprise and fewer restrictions and austerity measures than would be expected by Western nations in a counterpart situation.
Both Laos and Cambodia are constitutional monarchies, while the Vietnamese respond with less solidarity to the government indirectly controlled by the Chief of State, Bao Dai, nominal descendant of the Emperors of Annam. He is potentially a capable leader but unfortunately out of favor with many extreme Nationalists and non-Communist dissidents.
The overall attitude of the population borders on indifference. The failure of friendly propaganda toward both.development of a National attitude and the fostering of patriotism is an important deficiency. The uneducated native is inclined toward himself, his family and his tribe, or stock, in that order. The Japanese-inoculated spirity of Asia for the Asiatics has been adopted by Nationalisti leaders and the intelligentsia. The peasant, whose way of life has not been changed for centuries, is mostly apathetic.
The principal targets for Communism are among the educated classes, whose immediate resentment is the domination of the French through force of arms and political and economic controls. These people, when converted to Communism, muster more effective support from the peasantry and city workers than do the French and the educated Loyalists. Communist influence is strong and its organization very complete, particularly within the large cities. The contending leaders compete with each other for recruits -- the Communists holding forth idealistic rewards reinforced by threats, and the Loyalists stressing fear of the enemy as well as other inducements, some of which approach impressment.

The effect of the Ho Chi Minh bid for a negotiated peace and the French inclination to seek a settlement has had strong repercussions among the people, particularly those who pay double taxes, and whose villages are invaded, fought over and destroyed periodically by the opposing forces.
It is natural that the Communists will support the line of negotiation since implementation of any such peace will set the stage for Communist absorption of the entire area, without fail and immediately. The Ho Demarche, and the proven ability of his field forces to threaten seriously the French Union Forces, has had a profound affect on metropolitan France as well, where a considerable portion of the population is in favor of terminating an expensive and seemingly futile war.
PERFORMANCE OF MDAP — SUPPORTED FORCES
French and ASsociated States Forces have received MDAP equipment in increasing amounts since 1950. French Union Forces conduct modern joint military operations according to professionally accepted tactics and techniques, and in accordance with doctrines approved by the U.S. Armed Services. Applications vary in consonance with difficulties imposed by terrain and the climatic environment. It has been noted that this is a war which pits a modern mechanized army against a large and well-led guerrilla force. However, the character of the Viet Minh forces has been changing during the past year. Therefore, may inefficiencies must be charged against the mechanized army since it lacks complete opportunity to utilize its capabilities fully. Since it is neither practicable nor completely desirable to meet the enemy on the basis of guerrilla versus guerrilla, the ultimate solution will require the isolation of the Viet Minh from his base of supply in Red China and then overwhelming him by materiel superiority. In any instance, a requirement for provision of quantities of MDAP equipment exists and will continue to exist for an indeterminate period. Generally, maintenance standards of MDAP equipment are below those of the U.S. Armed Services, although within well-trained units employing equipment in the intended manner, favorable comparisons may be reached. Since many of the personnel of the French Union Army begin their careers as illiterate peasants, completely unskilled, the training and indoctrination task toward better maintenance is evident. MAAG visiting teams proffer such guidance as is feasible. Specific notification of superior, as well as unsatisfactory units, are made officially to the French military authorities. Under the existing terms of reference, MAAG has no authorized direct contact with armed forces of the Associated States. A significant weakness on the part of the French is their failure to project the r system of field operations and staff planning beyond their experience in Indochina. Imagination is frequently lacking. Also evident is the fact that their limited experience in world War II has stunted their overall development in modern warfare. This is basically the reason underlying their poor staff work, logistic and ~ operational plans. In addition, the French are sensitive and touchy and loath to accept advice, we frequently encounter outdated techniques dating back, to Colonial campaigns and World war I.
Another weakness of the French Union Force is the diversity of troops employed. The French Expeditionary Corps is composed of Foreign Legion, Moroccans. Algerians, Tunisians, Songaless and a small percentage of metropolitan French

volunteers. These units are diluted nearly 59 percent by native Indochinese. The Associated States Forces are composed of varieties of native Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians. The whole effect is that of a heterogeneous force among whom even basic communication is difficult. Troops require a variety of clothe sizes and diets. They have different religious customs, folkways and mores. They vary in their capacity for different tasks and terrain. Logistically, a great problem exists in the support of such troops.
On the other hand, the Rebels are mostly Vietnamese recruited largely from the hardy stocks of Tonkin and Annam. They are a truly homogenous army whose capabilities and requirements remain more or less consistent.
The MDAP equipment furnished the French Air Force of Indochina has converted it into a modern air arm capable of performing its combat mission in a highly satisfactory manner. It is an effective offensive or defensive combat weapon, the full potential of which has not been realized.
NATIONAL MILITARY SERVICE	.
a.	French Forces: All French Army personnel in Indochina are serving in the Regular Army. The draftee in France is not required by law to serve in Indochina. However, he may volunteer for such duty. The period of service in Indochina was formerly 24 months, but due to a shortage of replacements, the period currently is extended to 27 months. French personnel receive substantial increases in pay for service in Indochina.
■ .
b.	Vietnamese Forces: The original law which drafted man for military service required all physically fit males to undergo a period of service for 60 days. Until April 1953, this law was not strictly enforced. In April, it became, with minor changes, the basis for the ordinance drafting 40,000 men for duty with Kinh Quan battalions. Personnel are inducted into the army for the duration. They are selected on the basis of their family situation. Single men are taken first. A man enlisting for the Regular Army is taken on a trial basis for one year. A t the end of one year, and if his service has proven satisfactory, he can reenlist for a period of one, two, three or four years. Recently, the draft laws have been more vigorously enforced to eliminatc draft dodging.
INTER-SERVICE BALANCE OF FORCES IN INDOCHINA
While the majority of resources are devoted to ground operations, the following factors must be considered:
a.	The enemy has no air forces or naval forces other than junks and sampans.
b.	Friendly ground forces maintain a large proportion of river squadrons and lit aviation units	*

C. Opportunities for employment of large tactical air forces and seagoing naval and amphibious forces are limited.
d.	Strategic targets are limited. Terrain and enemy skill in camouflage reduce number of tactical targets.
e.	A shortage of trained air personnel exists, with limited prospects for augmentation from metropolitan France resources.
f.	Commercial resources satisfy a considerable portion of naval and air logistical requirements.
g.	Airfield construction limits composition of air traffic to light and medium transports and propeller-driven fighters and bombers. The balance of forces is considered adequate, although recently the French Air Force, motivated by unanticipated operational requirements in Laos and Dien Bien Phu, has requested additional B-26 light bombers, an additional C-4? transport squadron, and the loan of U.S. C-119 heavy transports and maintenance personnel. Civilian CAT pilots are presently on contract to the French Air Force for logistical missions. The Army likewise has requested increased air strength in the form of helicopter companies and liaison aircraft.	_
OBJECTIVES	.
—
The missions of the opposing forces may be considered as follows:
VIET MINH - To achieve, by attritive military and political action, a negotiated settlement of the war in Indochina upon such terms as will permit either.
a.	Absolute control of a portion of Viet Nam and Laos - generally considered to be north of the 18th Parallel, or
b.	Eventual control of the majority portion, or the complete entity, of Indochina as a result of a favorable political position achieved at the peace table.
FRENCH UI-HON - To achieve, by overwhelming military pressure and political action, a cessation of hostilities upon terms favorable to the French Union which wil
a.	Restrict the influence of une League of Independent Viet Nara Party-Viet Minh, to that of a controllable minority.
b.	Permit the establishment of sound, stable, solvent and harmoni us governments within the Associated'States.
c.	Enable France to maintain its position as the dominant member of the French Union - of the Far East - with extra territorial privileges and commercial benefits.	•
Naturally, the results of the Geneva Conference may be expected to have a strong influence on future political and military objectives in Indochina for both sides.

ORGANIZATION OF THE FRENCH UNION GROUND FORCES
By the end of 1954, French Union ground forces will consist of four French and one Vietnamese infantry division and one French airborne division. The ground divisions will be formed from 13 French RCTs and 9 Vietnamese RCTs. The airborne division will be formed from 2 French ARCTs and one Vietnamese ARCT. This force, known as the Battle Corps, will be supported by 5 armored battalions, 5 reconnaissance battalions, 5 amphibious battalions and 3 medium and 1 heavy artillery battalion. This represents the striking force of the French Union Forces, not much larger than a single U.S. type Army Corps. To free this force for independent action against the Rebel strongholds, the French consider that a force of twice that size is necessary for static defense and pacification purposes. By the end of 1955, this surface defense force will reach a total of 86 standard infantry battalions, 132 light infantry battalions, 1100 suppletive companies, the equivalent of 70 artillery batteries and 36 armored car companies. All units of the French. Union Army are equipped with a percentage of MDAP material. Amounts vary according to date of activation, depot stocks, mission and replacement factors. A certain percentage of hard items, estimated at 30 percent of gross requirements, is provided by French procurement agencies and may consist of identical, items to those of MDAP, having been acquired during World war II, or through other channels by which U.S. surplus stocks were distributed after 1946. Indigenous production is practically negligible, since local industry is not developed and barely sufficient to provide maintenance for civilian requirements. A certain number of paramilitary agencies exist in this theater of operations which are not MDAP supported. These include militia, national police, plantation guards' and others. Obviously, MDAP items, mostly small arms and ammunition will find their way by devious channels into unauthorized hands.
Due to the stress of constant warfare, circumstances are such that strict control is impossible. For example, an MDAP rifle, abandoned in battle may be acquired by a Viet Minh soldier, who will forfeit the same weapon upon his death or capture by paramilitary forces.	.
LOGISTICS OF THE GROUND FORCES
In general terms the organization and operation of the technical services which furnish logistical support to the combat arms is similar to that in the United States Army. The French Forces are handicapped by a insufficient number of units and trained specialists and consequently are unable to furnish the amount and quality of support given by comparable US units. For all technical services MDA Programs have furnished the spare parts and small items necessary to carryout adequate maintenance and repair programs.

French Forces: French Forces are, for .the most part, trained prior to shipment to Indochina. Training of individual replacements is done in the units to which they are assigned. French Far East ground forces operate schools for artillery, armor, engineer and transportation for their own forces and add-itTnnally provide generous quotas for Associated States personnel. Recently, four tactical training centers have been activated for use as maneuver areas for large tactical formations and battalions rotated out of static positions.
Vietnamese Forces: There are eight training centers for recruits of the Vietnamese Army. Four are for recruits for the Regular Army and four are for personnel to be activated into Kinh Quan (light infantry) battalions and companies. On-the-job training is conducted in technical fields for selected individuals upon assignment to a unit. In addition to this training, a limited number of specialists, technical, non-commissioned and officer schools exist. A considerable number of indigenous officers and men attend French schools both in France and Indochina. Training is not up to American standards.
The Associated States training plan has an annual capacity of about 65,000. It is considered adequate to meet phased build-up requirements. By American criteria, certain training deficiencies are conspicuous, particularly in such areas as standardization of training aids, programs of instruction, troop training programs and training literature. Utilization of plant facilities with greater efficiency is a further requirement. It is apparent that the Associated States forces are developing with more stress on quantity than quality. It is hoped that American guidance will prove acceptable and valuable to the French. The use of MDAP equipment has not generated any critical training problems, however a need exists for management training to encompass stock control; organization of depots and other procedural-type activities.
ORGANIZATION OF THE FRENCH NAVAL FORCES, FAR EAST
French naval strength is approximately 10,000. The only Associated States navy is a 1,000 man Vietnamese force. Naval forces are light units composed of approximately 250 light vessels and 100 small craft. These are supported by an aircraft carrier on loan from NATO and a squadron of privateer aircraft. Command of river, operations as well as overall logistic support is the responsibility of the Cmimander, French Naval Forces ashore. Direct coordination of naval river forces with the respective Army area commands is executed at the Naval area level. Commander, French Naval Forces, afloat, controls coastal operations including surveillance, blockade, and amphibious operations. Naval Aviation, Indochina, supports the Naval mission as directed. The aircraft carrier force is under Naval administrative command although embarked aircraft operate as directed by the French Air Force area tactical commands.

SUMMARY OF THE NAVAL SITUATION
The French Union naval forces in Indochina are reasonably effective on rivers and inshore areas. They have had much experience in river landings, combating, river ambushes and intercepting junk and small boat traffic on both the ocean and inland waterways. Also, logistic support by water to all services is a constant and heavy undertaking. For guerrilla warfare along the waterways in the Red River and Mekong River deltas, they are uniquely qualified and equipped. In other more orthodox forms of naval warfare such as large amphibious operations, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft warfare, they are neither trained nor equipped, with the establishment of the Joint Amphibious Staff and the formation of an Amphibious Corps, part of this deficiency should be eliminated. Although enemy submarines and aircraft have not been a factor in this war, the possibility does exist. There is little in Indochina to combat the potential menance. Limitations and restrictions for the conduct of the war at present are basically caused by a shortage of personnel rather than a lack of equipment. In addition, concrete and positive steps have been taken in the establishing of a Vietnamese National Navy. This will perform a two-fold purpose - that of easing the serious shortage of personnel and engendering a spirit of pride in the Vietnamese people through increased responsibility and participation in the conduct of the war in their homeland.
ORGANIZATION OF THE FRENCH AIR FORCE
As of 10 April 1954, the French Air Force consisted of 98 Bearcats, organized into 4 squadrons, 16 Bearcat Photo Recon Aircraft organized as a flight, 84 B-26 light bombers, expanding to 3 squadrons, a light tactical reconnaissance flight of modified B-26 bombers, 4 transport squadrons of 114 C-47s — 65 MDAP — and liaison aircraft squadrons consisting of 8 C-45s, 12 L-2O Beavers and 8 H-19 helicopters. Additionally, 85 Army liaison aircraft -L-19s - will be delivered by 31 August. 22 C-119 packets with supporting (200) mechanics are on loan during the present emergency.
SUMMARY OF THE AIR FORCE SITUATION	.
The general, MAAG opinion is that the individual flight and ground crews are very well qualified in operating and maintaining their equipment. However, there is not enough’ of them. Shortages of MDAP supplied equipment of he major categories has not restricted or hampered the operational ability of the FAF combat squadrons and support agencies. Some of the changes in methods and procedures which MAAG believed should be placed in effect are actually beyond the capability of the FAF due primarily to the shortage of personnel and ov rail restrictions imposed on the FAF by the political and economic situation both in Indochina and in Metropolitan France.
The French are highly operationally minded, however, they do not put proper emphasis on their logistics support requirements to support their operations. In spite of the MDAP equipment and machinery received, the development of this country's self-sufficiency has been abnormally slow.	.

ORGANIZATION AND TACTICS OF THE REBEL ARMY
The Viet Minh is a well-led, veteran guerrilla army of approximately 300,000 troops organized into 6 infantry divisions, a heavy division of artillery and engineers and numerous regiments, battalions and companies. It has a regional militia component as well as its regular troops. Its equipment and tactics are those of light infantry with a tremendous capability of cross country mobility and endurance. A high command is reputed to contain Red Chinese advisors. Until the pitched battle at Dien Bion Phu, the rebels followed the strategy of hit and run with much of its maneuver dictated by political objectives. The manner in which this force deployed its battle corps into assault infantry, and, with effective artillery support, captured several highly organized and well-defended strong points, indicates a versatility not fully appreciated prior to this campaign season. Additionally, the Viet Minh arc skilled in psychological and political indoctrination and have been able to establish bases of operations behind French fortified lines, particularly in the delta. The recent capability of the Viet Minh to seize territory throughout Indochina, albeit temporarily, will have a profound effect upon the conferences at Geneva.
CONDUCT OF THE WAR -- MILITARY ASPECTS
In June 1953, General Navarre formulated a set of principles for the conduct of the war in Indochina. This was described in the O'Daniel report as the Navarre concept for successful conclusion of the war in Indochina, but it is less a formula for successfully concluding the war than a statement of short term aims, to wit:
a.	To retake the initiative immediately through the carrying out, beginning this summer, of local offensives and by pushing to the utmost commando and guerrilla actions.
b.	To take the offensive in the north beginning September 15, in order to forestall the enemy attack. To conduct the battle which will take place.during the fall and winter of 1953-54 in an offensive manner by attacking the flanks and rear of the enemy.
. c. To recover from areas not directly involved in the battle a maximum number of units. To pacify these regions progressively.
d.	To build up progressively a battle corps by grouping battalions into regiments and regiments into divisions and by giving to the units thus created

the necessary support - artillery, engineers, armor, communications - taking into account the very special character of the war in Indochina, the terrain--the enemy. To bring about a maximum of cooperation with the Air Force and the Navy.
e.	To maintain a reserve of special type units — armor, commando, light battalion, etc., for attachment to groups and divisions in accordance with terrain and mission.
f.	To continue the effort of instructing and organizing the army of the Associated States so as to give them more and more participation as well as more and more autonomy in the conduct of operations.
Note: The above was given to General O'Daniel, in writing by General Navarre on 29 June 1953 and was thereafter referred to as the Navarre concept for the successful conclusion of war in Indochina.
Few of these aims are progressing satisfactorily. The training of the National armies is woefully inefficient and the series of tactical offensive operations engaged in during 1953-54 fighting season, instead of retaking the initiative has lost it to the Viet Minh. After a rathcr encouraging beginning with the Lang Son operation, Navarre’s later operations reveal that he is fol-• lowing the same conservative defensive tactics as his predecessor, General Salan. Although Mouette was highly publicized as a successful offensive, it in fact was nothing but a reconnaissance in force with the objective of occupying a strong position and awaiting attack by the enemy in the hope of dealing him a crippling blow. The enemy refused to be taken in. The current campaign season has been dominated by the Viet Minh, and the present position of the French Union Forces is no improvement over that of last year. Dien Bien Phu is not only another Na San but a grave tactical and strategic error. The only hope for gain from the battle now raging is that the French can survive. The French have consistently postponed seizure of the initiative through failure to select and pursue vital military objectives such as the obvious enemy troop concentration depot and communications area in the foothills north of the Tonkin delta. Viet Minh leader-ship, on the other hand, has capitalized on this vacated opportunity by seizing and holding the initiative. The French battle corps, which was built up hope-fully by energetic withdrawal of implanted units, has now been dissipated into four sizeable components: (1) Dien Bien Phu -- 12 battalions -- an expensive-supplied airhead, is encircled and under heavy attack. (2) Seno-Savannakhet-Thakhek-Pakse area — 15 battalions — partially supported by air with its overland communications threatened. (3) Operation Atlanta --25 battalions --a coastline sweep north from Nha Trang, which has uncovered no appreciable enemy, and (4) the Tonkin delta — 18 battalions -- where the enemy is increasing his attacks on real’ installations and lines of communications. The lack of initiative which the French have is emphasized by the day-to-day reaction of the French to enemy moves and activity as expressed in recent requests for emergency assistance in the way of U.S. equipment and maintenance personnel.
French tactics are based primarily on defense, even though French Union Forces outnumber Viet Minh forces by almost 2 to 1, have overwhelming fire power, and upopposed air force, a balanced naval force and strategic transport capability. The barbed wire concept is exemplified by the fact that the French have established a requirement of 4000 tons of this item per month over and abovo that furnished by France. The bulk of the C-119 airlift for Dien Bien Phu supply was utilized in dropping barbed wire.

French Union forces do not as a general rule attempt to gain and maintain contact with the enemy, but rather, they wait for the Viet Minh to attack. Patrolling is the exception rather than the rule. Viet Minh regular battle corps troops have been avoided unless the French troops are well dug in behind barbed wire or have astronomical odds in their favor.
Night operations are never employed by French Union forces although the Viet Minh use such operations most successfully. French forces retire to their fortified and secured areas at nightfall, and control only the areas of their fields of fire. Night operations training should be instituted and emphasized in their training programs, and French Union forces should be as adopt and successful in such operations as the enemy. -
At present there is no evidence that the French staff is working off-detailed plans for the final offensive which General Navarre has indicated to me as Chief MAAG will occur during the next dry season, 1954-55.
Although Navarre demands that his requirement for U.S. equipment should not be challenged by this MAAG, the fact is that the small inadequate French, staff handling this function is not capable of accurately presenting requirements for Indochina, were it not for the screening which these requests undergo by MAAG, material would be wastefully supplied, and many critical and sudden shortages would occur. Many examples of this lack of planning foresight can be found in the files of this MAAG, such as requests for specialized equipment requiring specially trained operators with no companion plan to provide such operators -- request for a specific amount of ammunition in January is constitute a year, supply only to double the request in April - not because of an oversight or error but because of poor planning for the operations to occur during the intervening months.
This lack of French staff capability and to a great extent the conservative and defensive attitude of the entire theater of operations, is due in large measure to the fact that many of the officers on duty in this theater are over age in grade according to U.S. standards, and are lacking in drive and imagination. Lack of"command supervision is obvious in all echelons, the best evidence of which is the absence of command inspections and maintenance inspections of equipment of commanders. End-use inspections by members of this MAAG frequently reveal that higher commanders have never made an inspection of equipment in their subordinate units. Shortage of personnel is another contributing factor which cannot be overcome except through more extensive support from metropolitan France.

. POLITICAL ASPECTS
A strictly military solution to the war in Indochina is not possible. Military operations are too closely bound to concurrent political problems, and most of the military decisions concerning tactics and strategy have their origin in the politics of the situation here. The governments of the three Associated States are comparatively weak, and are almost as insistent upon complete autonomy from France as they are on liberation from the Communists. It is doubtful if the ordinary people understand the issues at stake between the rebel and Associated States objectives. It probably appears to them that they are being ground between the two political groups, one of which seeks to achieve autonomy by Communist methods. The other by political evolution. They are not aware of the dangers of domination by Communism nor of the'difference between democracy and the Communist People's Government as we understand it.
The French have a tremendous investment in Indochina and have made great strides in bringing the advantages of Western civilization to the people, yet the French are not wanted. Colonialism is still the chief argument against the French and with some substance. The natives are still considered as second-rate people and the French have only made concessions reluctantly and when forced to do so. There is a lack of comaraderis between the native soldier and officer and the French. Separate messes are maintained, due in some measure to the difference in dietary preference, but also due to this lack of friendly association in a common cause.
The Viet Minh, on the other hand, are fighting a clever war of attrition, without chance of a major military victory, but apparently feeling that time is working in their favor and that French and U.S. public opinion will force eventual favorable negotiation.
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS
In 1949 the French, in a search for Nationalist support against Ho Chi Minh, recognized Bao Dai, playboy scion of the ancient Annamite emperors as Chief of State of Viet Nam which was given its independence within the framework of the French Union. Bao Dai is popularly believed to be very pro-French, and most of the people have a luke-warm feeling toward the Government which they feel is not earnestly working for their complete independence from France. The French promise independence, but only reluctantly give concessions.
The key to this problem is a strong and effective Nationalist army with the support of the Populist behind it. When the people have confidence in their government and in its ability, through the Nationalist army, to give them the protection from Communist terrorism which is necessary for business and commerce, then complete victory will be in sight.

THE U.S. CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAR IN INDOCHINA
The U.S. has greatly contributed to the success of the French in holding Indochina from the beginning. In January 1951, material was rushed from the docks of Haiphong to the battlefield of Vinh Yen, then being fought under the personal direction of Marshall De Lattre himself. Since then, delivery of aid has kept pace with changing French needs, often on a crash basis, down to the present heroic defense of Dien Bien Phu. U.S. aid has consisted of budgetary support, furnishing of end items, military hardware, and of technical training teams. The magnitude and range of this contribution is shown by the following very few examples. All of these figures are as of 31 March this year.
a.	785 million dollars has been allocated for the budgetary support of the French Expeditionary Force and the Vietnamese Army. This will assist in meeting budgetary requirements for pay, food, and allowances for these troops.
b.	Under MDA Programs, a total of more than 784 millions of dollars has been programmed for the years 1950-54. Of this, more than 440 million dollars worth of military end items have been received.
c.	To date, 31 March 1954, 441 ships have delivered a total of 478 thousands of long tons of MDA equipment to Indochina.
SOLUTION
As in Korea, Iran, Malaya, and Burma, the war in Indochina is not a separate entity. It is another tentacle of the octopus, another brush fire on the periphery of the iron and bamboo curtains. The problem can only be solved completely if the masters of the Kremlin decide that Indochina should be abandoned in favor of more profitable enterprises elsewhere. However, ways and means exist to achieve a degree of success with respect to Indochina, beginning at the political level —■' specifically at the level of Chiefs of State, what is then necessary 'S as follows:
a.	An agreement must be reached with the French to deliver their strongest possible assault upon the Viet Minh as soon as possible to reduce the efficiency of that force to its lowest potential.
b.	Concurrently, the Associated States armies must be put through a training cycle designed to produce leaders and units and to develop confidence through skill and achievement. Such forces must be developed to the level of the ROK or Greek armies under American tutelage and material support for these forces must be in being and capable of replacing the French when they retire.
c.	A defensive alliance of democratic nations of the Orient must be developed to provide future stability for the Associated States. The U.S. must establish leadership in this area by relieving the French in a similar manner as was followed in relieving the British fqr the responsibility of Greece.
d.	The sovereignty and territorial borders of the Associated States must be guaranteed - under no circumstances should the country be allowed to divide on an arbitrary parallel such as in Korea.

CONCLUSION
I recommend that the Department of Defense urge that negotiations for
agreements to be initiated at the earliest time to achieve the foregoing objectives and that upon reaching an understanding with France and the Associated States, a full-scale U.S. training mission be established with the Associated States forces to achieve an effective training base by Spring of 1956. That the French overwhelm the enemy in the interim is a vital concurrent requirement, and, again, this objective must be achieved by governmental agreement, with the U.S. insisting that the French Government establish military victory as a primary objective and so instruct the field commander, who may then be relieved of his anxieties regarding casualties and indifferent political and moral support from France.
In conclusion, I reaffirm my opinion that victory in Indochina is an international rather than a local matter, and essentially political as well as military.

(SOUTHEAST ASIA):
Subject: U.S. Objectives and Courses of Action with Respect to Southeast Asia (NSC 5405)
Reference: Secretary of Defense memorandum, 4 March 1954, subject as above
In accordance with the above request from the Secretary of Defense, the following informal comments are submitted:
a.	Reference paragraph 21.
(1)	On 14 December 1953, the Secretary of Defense informed the Chief, MAAG, Indochina, that Indochina has the highest MDAP priority. It is the only nation with this priority classification and, as such, has
•	precedence over every other allied nation and the
U.S. armed forces for the allocation of equipment in short supply. Generally, military assistance equip. ment is being delivered at the scheduled rates, which are up to the capability of Indochinese forces to utilize effectively. Thailand is being furnished MDA .	equipment under a limited program. This material is
generally being delivered at the rate at which the Thailand forces can most effectively utilize it. Burma is not a recipient nation for MDAP grant aid. Initial arrangements have been made to provide Burma on a reimbursable basis, but no actual deliveries under this program have yet been made.
(2)	Major General O'Daniel has been appointed Chief, MAAG, Indochina. This was as a result of an NSC action designed to increase the influence of the United States in the prosecution of the war in Indochina, particularly training of local forces, effective command and intel-ligence arrangements, and operational planning.

b.	Reference paragraph 31.
(1)	A military plan for U.S. intervention in Indochina has been completed and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This plan has been forwarded to appropriate commanders of airfield commands for the preparation of detailed plans.
(2)	The Joint Chiefs of Staff currently have under preparation an outline plan based upon concurrent
(renewal of hostilities in Korea and intervention in Indochina by the Chinese Communists.
(3)	CINCPAC has been directed to prepare plans as follows:
(a)	Blockade of China coast.
(b)	Assistance to the British in HongKong, as desirable and feasible.
(c)	Evacuation of French Union forces from the Tonkin Delta.
(d)	Participation defensively or offensively of Chinese National forces.
(4)	CINCPAC Operation Plan No. 44-53 is a plan approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a naval blockade of Communist China.
(5)	Other CINCPAC Operation Plans have been prepared to cover the contingencies in paragraph (3) above, but have not yet been approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
' c. Although not directly part of the implementation of NSC 5405, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have under preparation the military plans directed in NSC Action No. 1086 a. These plans cover not only U.S. intervention in Indochina but also augmentations in forces and supplies required to permit the United States to maintain at present levels its present defense commitments and to be prudently prepared to face possible increased risks of (1) Chinese Communist intervention, and (2) general war.

Following is outline given this morning by Chauvel to Dennis, Allen and Achilles of proposal which Bidault last night sent to French Cabinet for authorization to make when substantive discussion of Indochina starts:
1.	Vietnam problem is purely Vietnamese with no question ' of partition, only military struggle for control of government.
2.	Situation different in Laos and Cambodia which are victims of external aggression.
3.	Under Berlin agreement, purpose of Geneva conference
is to establish peace in all three countries. To this end there should be a cease-fire guaranteed by adequate military and administrative controls under supervision. Cease-fire would take effect only when such guarantees had been embodied in armistic conventions, which might be different for each three states, and when control machinery had been established Iand was in place. Controls would be based upon Daniel's
March 5 conditions. When cease-fire occurred, regular troops would be regrouped into delimited areas and all other forces disarmed. The control machinery would be "international" and would require considerable body of personnel. •
•	4. After peace had been re-established by the cease-fire,
political and economic problems could be examined.
In discussing this draft proposal Chauvel said French assumed Russians would propose immediate cease-fire followed by political settlement based on coalition and immediate elections, which would force west into position of opposing cease-fire

cease-fire. French public desire for cease-fire was emotional and French Government could defend its proposal, even though it would in effect delay any cease-fire for long time if not indefinitely, on grounds that conditions demanded were essential for safety of troops themselves. The continued resistance at Bien Bien Phu long after public opinion had discounted its fall had conditioned French opinion to believe its loss would not mean loss of war. He did not exclude possibility of conference calling on opposing forces not to undertake new military operations during negotiations. He assumed very lengthy negotiations would be necessary to reach any armistice agreement and felt that during this period Communist uncertainty as to united action of US intervention might be increased.
Allen inquired whether at some stage in proceedings working out of armistice details might be left to combattants themselves as suggested in Colombo communique. Chauvel did not like this idea but said it might be considered. In response to question as to whether he envisaged conference turning into indefinite Panmunjom Chauvel said it might turn .	armistice negotiations over to working group and adjourn to
. reconvene when warranted.
■ In response to Achilles inquiry as to whether "international" meant "UN" supervision, Chauvel stated French had no firm position on this but subsequent discussion indicated French continue to oppose use of UN machinery as establishing precendent which would be used against them in North Africa and elsewhere and that British definitely share their point of view. Allen suggested something like peace observation commission would be preferable to UN auspices. Achilles stressed importance of insisting on UN auspices.
Chauvel said studies by French military had confirmed their impression that withdrawal of French Union Forces from Cambodia and uaos except for two bases in latter would be of definite military advantage rather than disadvantage.

ITEM 1 (For Discussion) » —
- REPORT Bl MR. DULLES OU GENEVA AI© II'lDO-CHHLA
1, Secretary Dulles, who was rather pessimistic,in reporting to the
•	President yesterday morning on the Geneva Conference, made the following
points': (a) there is no responsible "French Government with which to deal; ■ (b) the British have declined to take a position regarding a Southeast Asia' regional grouping until after the Geneva Conference; (c) the British however ■	are willing to proceed with secret talks with us regarding the political and
military scope of our plans for SEA; (d) the expected Communist proposal re Indo-China ’.rill call for evacuation of all foreign troops and elections to be supervised by a joint Vi.etminh-Viotr.a.m Commission; (c) French have no particular form of settlement in mind; UK is still thinking in terms of partition.
• 2. It is not clear hoar the NSC discussion will develop, but it secms desirable that certain questions be clarified at the meeting. They are along this line:	’	,
a.	Should the U.S. resign itself to being unable to influence any .-further the French and U.K. positions at Geneva? (i.e., is it still not
• possible to stiffen their spines by any conceivable means - Presidential talks, threats, sending Mr. Dulles back with a new mandate, etc. - so as to assure they will not accept a dangerous compromise.)
b.	is or is not the U.S. prepared to commit its combat forces in the near future, in some form of regional effort if possible, to save thc partition or loss of Indo-China? decision in principle secms necessary now. As the situation is at present we are saying we will consider this if the parliaments of Australia, Nev Zealand, etc. agree, but it is not clear whether ve mean before or after Indo-China is lost.)
c.	is the U.S. prepared to acquiesce in the clearly engineered Communist aggression in and taking over of Indo-China - with Red Chinese support - even though we evaluate this loss as very serious to the free world and even though we have the military means to redeem the situation? ' (The A-bomb)
3.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff sent you a memorandum several days ago (see TAB A) recommending that you "secure governmental acceptance" of the following position;
"In the event of a cease fire in Indochina, the shipment of military end. items under U.S. MDAP .... will, immediately be suspended, except for such spares and associated maintenance items necessary to the maintenance of equipment in operations. The entire question of U.S. aid to Indochina will be re-examined in the light of circumstances then existing."
The Office of thc .Assistant Secretary of Defense (ISA) has suggested, you forward the -aeno to the NSC se.ying you concur, hut you have not yet acted on
• the matter. You may wish to raise it durirg the discussion.

ultimately resulting in the loss of Indochina to the Communists. *

wrangle characterised by steadfast Communist adherence to an inflexible position on important issues and by repeated sub-t stantiVe concessions by the French. Moreover, experience in Korea indicates that regardless of the military and administrative controls Which might be embodied in the armistice con-
. ventions, it is certain that the Communists would flagrantly "... * evadecircumvent, and violate the agreement's to suit their ultimate purpose of subjugating all of Indochina. Even though , the Communists should agree to international control machinery, Communist practices would render it impotent, as in the caae of the Neutral Nations SuperVisory Commission in Korea.
4.	Bhsed on past performance, it is doubtful that the Com-munists would enter into a preliminary agreement to refrain from new military operations during the course of armistice negotiations. On the contrary, it is more likely that they would intensify military operations during negotiations’ in order to enhance' their negotiating position, Whereas the French would i	be under strong compulsion to avoid casualties during the

5-	The Joint Chiefs of Staff share the view of the US DEL that once armistice proposals are made the French would rapidly moVe toward acceptance of the probable Communist counterproposal of an immediate cease-fire.

6.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree that it is no longer

I tion, and that, in the absence of a settlement Which Would reasonably assure the political and territorial integrity of the Associated States, any armistice entered into Would Inevitably lead to the eVentual loss of that area to Communist control.	• .

May 7, 1954
At a meeting in the President's office this morning with Dulles, three topics were discussed:
1.	Whether the President should approve paragraph lb of the tentative Record of Action of the 5/6/54 NSC Meeting, which covers the proposed answer to the Eden proposal. The Secretary of State thought the text was correct, wilson and Radford preferred the draft message to Smith for Eden prepared yesterday by MacArthur and Captain Anderson, and cleared by the JCS, which included in the Five Power Staff Agency Thailand and the Philippines. Radford thinks that the Agency (which has hitherto been not disclosed in SEA) has really completed its military planning; that if it is enlarged by top level personnel, its actions will be necessarily open to the world; that therefore some Southeast Asian countries should be included in it, and he fears Eden's proposal as an intended delaying action.
The Presient approved the text of paragraph lb, but suggested that Smith’s reply to Eden's proposal should make clear the following:
1.	Five Power Staff Agency, alone or with other nations, is not to the United States a satisfactory substitute for a broad political coalition which will include the Southeast Asian countries which are to be defended.
2.	Five Power Staff Agency examination is acceptable to see how these nations can give military aid to the Southeast Asian countries in their cooperative defense effort.
3.	The United States will not agree to a "white man's party" to determine the problems of the Southeast Asian nations.
I was instructed to advise wilson and Radford of thc above, and have done so.
2.	. The President went over the draft of the speech which Dulles is going to make tonight, making quite a few suggestions and changes i’n text. He though additionally the speech should include some easy to understand slogans, such as "The IS will never start a war," "The US will not go to war without Congressional authority," "The US, as always, is trying tr' organize cooperative efforts to sustain the peace."
3.	with reference to the cease-fire proposal transmitted by Bidault to the French Cabinet, I read the following, as views principally of * ilitary members of the Planning Board, expressed in their yeaterday afternoon meeting: '
1.	US should not support the Bidault proposal.
2.	Reasons for this position:
a.	The mere proposal of the cease-fire at the Geneva Conference would destroy the will to fight of French forces and make fence-sitters jump to Vietminh side.

b.	the Communists would evade covertly cease-fire controls.
3.	The US should (as a last act to save Indo'China) propose to France that if the following 5 conditions are met, the US will go to . Congress for authority to intervene with combat forces:
grant of genuine freedom for Associated State
US take major responsibility for training indigenous forces
c.	US share responsibility for military planning
d.	- French forces to stay in the fight and no requirement of replacement by US forces.
(e. Action under UN auspices?)
This offer to be made known simultaneously to the other members of the proposed regional grouping (UK, Australia, NZ, Thailand, Associated States, Philippines) in order to enlist their participation.
I then summarized possible objections to making the above proposal to the French:
a.	No French Government is now competent to act in a lasting way.
b.	There is no indication France wants to "internationalize" the
conflict.
c.	The US proposal would be made without the prior assurance of a
regional grouping of SEA States, a precondition of Congress; although this point might be added as another condition to the proposal.
. d. US would be "baling out colonial France" in the eyes of the
world.
p. US cannot undertake alone to save every situation of trouble.
I concluded that some PB members felt that it had never been made clear to the French that the US was willing to ask for Congressional authority, if certain fundamental preconditions were met; that these matters had only been hinted at, and that the record of history should be clear as to the US position. Dulles was interested to know the Presi-
dent’s views, because he is talking with Ambassador Bonnet this afternoon. He indicated that he would mention these matters to Bonnet, perhaps making
a more broad hint than heretofore. He would not circulate any formal paper to Bonnet, or to anyone else.
The President referred to the proposition advanced by Governor Stassen at the April 29 Council Meeting as not having been thoroughly thought out.

He said that he had been trying to get France to "internationalize" matters for a long time, and they are not willing to do so. If it were though advisable at this time to point out to the French the essential pre-conditions to the US asking for Congressional authority to intervene, then it should also be made clear to the French as an additional precondition that the US would never intervene alone, that there must be an invitation by the indigenous people, and that there must be some kind of regional and collective action.
I understand that Dulles will decide the extent to which he cares to follow this line with Ambassador Bonnet. This discussion may afford Dulles guidance in replying to Smith's request about a US alternative to support the Bidault proposal, but there really was no decision as to the US attitude toward the cease-fire proposal itself.

Excerpts from the First Plenary Session The Geneva Conference Indochina Phase
•	May 8, 1954
The French Proposals
"....The French Government is thus confident that it has done everything in its power to put an end to the conflict. Not only has it removed all reason for this conflict to exist by recognizing fully and unreservedly the independence of Viet-Nam, Laos and Cambodia but, furthermore, the French Government has manifested for a long time its readiness and its desire of obtaining a reasonable settlement which would allow for the hostilities to be brought to an end. This is the main and primary task assigned to this Conference....
"we propose that the Conference should, first of all, declare that it adopt the principle of a general cessation of hostilities in Indochina based upon the necessary guarantees of security....
".... in agreeing upon the withdrawal of the invading forces and the restoration of the territorial integrity of those states....
"....For France there is a Viet-Nam state of which the unity, terri-torial integrity and independence must be respected.•..
"	t
"....the most just solution of the political problem can be found and finally assured only when the population is in a position to express in complete freedom its sovereign will by means of free elections. For the present moment I repeat the problem is that of bringing about a cessation of hostilities and the guaranteeing of that cessation. These guarantees, in our opinion, must be of two kinds.
"....the regular forces of the two parties would be brought together in clearly demarcated regrouping zones....the implementation of th agreement should be placed under the supervision of international commissions. ...
"....the agreement.... should be guaranteed in appropriate conui-tions by the states participating in the present Conference....
"....The French proposal is as follows:
"I. Vietnam	.

1.	All regular units to be assembled in assembly areas to be defined by the Conference on the basis of proposals . by the Commanders-in-Chief.

2.	All elements not belonging either to the army or to the police forces to be disarmed.
3.	All prisoners of war and civil internees to be released immediately.
4.	Execution of the above provisions to be supervised by international commissions.
5.	Hostilities to cease as soon as the agreement is signed. The assembly of troops and disarmament of forces as above provided to begin not later than x days (the number to be
fixed by the Conference) after the signature of the agreement....	-

3.	All prisoners of war and civil internees to be released immediately.

4.
Execution of the above provisions to be supervised by international commissions.
"III. These agreements shall be guaranteed by the States partici-
pating in the Geneva Conference. In the event of any violation thereof there shall be an immediate consultation between the guarantor States for the purpose of taking appropriate measures either individually or collectively.
"This, Mr. President, is the proposal submitted to the Conference on the responsibility of the French Delegation and by that Delegation. Thank you, sir....	.
The Viet Minh Proposals
"....In the same spirit, expressing the sentiment of the three peoples of Vietnam, Khmer, and Pathet Lao, the delegation of the
Democratic Republic of Viet Nam proposes to the conference that it
invite the official representatives of the governments of resistance of Khmer and of the government of resistance of Pathet Lao to take part in its work. We submit this proposal having in mind the following:

"....Alas, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam 'proposes to the conference that it adopt the following resolution:
"’In view of the present situation of the countries of Indochina and in the interests of the thorough and objective examination of the question of the cessation of hostilities and the reestablishment of peace in Indochina, the conference recognizes the necessity to invite the representatives of the governments of resistance of Khmer and Pathet Lao to take part in the work of the conference in regard to the question of the reestablishment of peace in Indochina.’
"Having submitted this proposal to the conference, I would ask the President of this meeting to authorize me to continue my statement when the conference has discussed the proposal that I have submitted ....

INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS
MEMORAI1DLM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
SUBJECT: Future U. S. Action Regarding Indo-China
■ •
1.	In light of the French having tabled an armistice proposal at Geneva, the United States must now decide whether:
•	a. To intervene activelv in the Indo-China war to redeem the situation.
■ - “
b.	To exercise all feasible pressure to require the French Government to avoid all compromise at Geneva and to take increased effective military and political action against the Viet Minh in Indo-China. This appears
, realistically possible only if the decision to implement a above is also
j made.	•»
c.	To adopt a passive policy toward the negotiations at Geneva while endeavoring to organize hastily a regional grouping, with U.S. participation, . to hold what remains of Southeast Asia.
: ' ‘ .
2.	Decisions a plus b offer the only sure way to stop the Communist advance. They involve substantial risk of war with Red China and increased risk of general war. However, recognizing the steadily increasing Soviet capabilities in nuclear warfare and the consequent steady diminution of the present military advantage of the U.S. over the USSR, these increased risks can more surely and
.	safely be accepted now than ever again.
3.	Decision c would be a compromise involving clear possibilities for piecemeal advancement of Communist control over the balance of free Asia despite the best efforts of the U.S. to the contrary. The likelihood of further such advancement would be- somewhat dimiuishcd if the U.S. made publicly clear that the further support by Moscow and Peiping of Communist aggression or subversion as judged by the U.S., would entail direct military action by the U.S against ' the source or sources of this support. z However, it might be months or years
* before further subversion would enable such a U.S. judgment. By then the increased Soviet nuclear capability might well inhibit the U.S. Government from implementing its announced intention. Asia could thus be lost. .
4.	Therefore, it would appear that the U.S. Government must decide whether to take the steps accessary to contain Ccmmunis-a in Asia within Red China bv intervention in Indo-China or accept the probable loss of Asia to Communist/.

The following basic instructions, which by the President, ’..’ill guide you, as head of
have been approved the United States
Delegation, in your participation in the Indochina phase of the Geneva Conference.
1.	The presence of a United States representative during the discussion at the Geneva Conference of "the problem of restoring peace in Indochina" rests on the Berlin Agreement of February 13, 1954. Under that agreement the US, UK, France and USSR agreed that the four of them plus other interested states should be invited to a conference at Geneva on April 26 "for the purpose of reaching a peaceful settlement of the Korean question" and agreed further, that "the problem of restoring peace in Indochina" would also be discussed at Geneva by the four powers represented at Berlin, and Communist China and other interested states.
2.	You will not deal with the delegates of the Chinese Communist regime, or any other regime not now diplomatically recognized by the United States, on any terms which imply political recognition or which concede to that regime any status other than that of a regime with which it is necessary to deal on a de facto basis in
ordcr to end aggression peacc.

The United States is participating in the Indochina phase of the Conference in order thereby to assls'c in -arriving-at decisions which will help the nations of that area peacefully to enjoy terri-torial integrity and political independence under stable and free governments with the opportunity to expand their economies, to realize thdr legitimate national aspirations, and to develop security through individual and collective defense against aggression, from withir or

that these people should not be

Laniel asked me to come to see him at 10 Sunday night. I found him in a strong and courageous mood reminiscent of the conversations I had last summer at the beginning of the ne-gotiations over the Navarre plan and quite in contrast with his mood of the past few weeks. He stated that he plans to . take a very firm position in the National Assembly on Tuesday when Indochina problem comes up again. He plans to say that there are decisions of vital military importance to be taken daily at Geneva. If the National Assembly has someone else in mind whom they can put into office promptly to handle these decisions in a better fashion than he can, they should do so, but that if they are not (repeat not) prepared for the immediate reconstitution of a new government (which they are not) they should stop talking about Indochina and let the government get on with its difficult task.
Laniel then expressed considerable concern regarding (1) the prospects at Geneva; and (2) and more important, the military situation in Indochina. He felt that Indochina phase of Geneva conference hud got off to a bad start and considered it very likely that in view of the division and weakness among the western powers, the Communists will not (repeat not) accept the French proposal for a cease-fire with guarantees, but will press for what in effect would be total surrender.
He said it had been made clear to the French delegation by the Communists that they could not (repeat not) have any conversations direct with the Viet Minh at Geneva but must in all cases proceed through the Chinese. This, plus the fact of large scale Chinese intervention at Dien-Bien-Phu, made it clear that the enemy France
is facing

is facing is not (repeat nOt) the Viet Minh rebels, but COmmunist China. Laniel obserVed that Communist China had fcught the Whole UN tO a standstill in Korea. Obvicusly France alone Was • ho (repeat 00) match for China. The strength With Which the French cculd Oppcse Chines© prOpOsitiOns at GeneVa WOuld have a direct cOnnectiOn With the aniOunt of suppOrt they received from the other Western povers, particularly the US. In the final analysis, the Only such suppOrt, Which he felt WOuld have any real effect On the Chinese, WOuld be the direct threat Of US military interVention. He Very much feared that the Communist side WOuld attempt so drag Out the negOtiatiOns by interminable procedural debates On such subjects as the admission tO the COnference Of mcn-existent Communist GoVernments Of Laos and CambOdla until such time as they cOuld gain a military decisiOn in the field.
Laniel then turned tO the immediate military prOblem. He said that ths Viet Minh had_announced that they WOuld net (repeat nOt) cease OperatlOns this year during the mOnsOOn. Their v next Object!Ve, after Dien-Bien-Phu, WOuld in all probability be Hanci. Under ordinary circumstances it shOuld take the
• Viet Minh approximately a mOnth tO rnOVe their trOOps frOtn Dien-Bien-Phu tO the Hanci area. HOWever, it might be pOSsible tO reduce this peried tO tuo Or three weeks if the Viet Minh made an all’Out effort. He alsO feared that in Viev; Of thc success which the Chinese have had With their military interVenticn at Dien-Bien-Phu, they WOuld nOt (repeat net) DOW hesitate tO interVene further With supplies and eVen With additional persOnnel, tO the extent necesaary tO gain a knockOut VictOry at Hanoi.
It therefcre was Vitally impOrtant, as a first Order of business, for the French tO decide hew to regroup their fOrces in Indcchina SO as best to prOtect thc expeditdenary COrps. Laniel said that he wOuld much prefer tO take these military decisiOns With the aid Of competent US military adVice, rather than te’teke them by himself. He alsO said that he wOuld haVe tO kt n-;, in COnnection With making his decisiOns, What, if any, military actiOn the US might be prepared tO take in IndOchina and under uhat, if any, circumstances. If there Was nO (repeat m) possibility Of US military help at any point, the regrOupmeto Of forces WOuld hare tO be much ttiOre'drastic, and the first thing tO be dOne WOuld be the COmplete evacuatiOn and abandonment to the Viet Minh of the entire territories Of Ln0s and Cambodia.
He stated that there were 15 French UniOn battalicns presently in Lacs which wOuld have tO be redeployed tO the Delta Or tO sOT.e area near the sea. In additiOn, the French-held lines in' the Delta wOuld have to bs greatly shortened.

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE	,
SUBJECT; United States "Posture" at Geneva Conference	«
Captain Grant and I went over with Mr. Hensel the State Department "Draft Instructions to the U.S. Delegation at Geneva." we all agreed that as presently drafted they imply that the U.S. is at Geneva to "cheer the players" rather than to "pitch." The following specific comments are to raise the basic question with State, which is: are we in Geneva to try to the limit of our capacities to influence the outcome along the lines we want - or are we content to take a passive role? We think that to accept the latter is to accept defeat in advance.
1.	Regarding para. 3, the United States, while not a "belligerent," is certainly vitally interested in the successful handling of the Indochina phase at Geneva. A.gain, while not technically a "principal" in the negotiation it would seem the U.S. should act from its position as the strongest
. nation in the free world and endeavor consistently to influence the progress of negotiations towards our objectives. Consequently it is recommended that this paragraph be amended by the insertion of the word "vitally" before the words "interested nations" and the insertion of the word "technically" before the words "a belligerent or a principal."
2.	Regarding para. 4, this could be strengthened somewhat to give proper guidance as to "posture," by changing the words "to assist in arriving at decisions" to "to promote decisions." It is further suggested that, in the last sentence, the word "implies" be changed to "means."
3.	With regard to para. 6, the U.S. Delegation should manifest more positive efforts than merely those of "cooperation" with other Allied Delegations. 'To this end, this paragraph should be changed to read:
"You should, insofar as is compatible with these instructions, cooperate with and endeavor to influence the Delegation of France and with the Delegations of other friendly participants in this phase of the Conference in order to further the attainment of U.S, objectives."
4.	with regard to para. 7, there appears to be a profoundly important point involved. This point is, in effect, will the United States admit diplomatic defeat and cease to use all means to influence the Conference towards its ends, if the Conference appears to be going against us. It has been argued that this should be done so as to relieve the U.S. of responsibility and permit the U.S. to pursue, with complete freedom of action, such

steps as it then felt were necessary. Consideration must be given to what steps could be taken if we withdraw from a conference which we helped initiate and of which we were an inviting Power. If such steps to be contemplated include any direct military action in the area, the U.S. would be risking being called an "aggressor" if it tried to take action of this sort while the Conference was still in session. Para. 29 of . NSC 5405, the approved policy on Southeast Asia, states "If the French ■ actually enter into negotiations with the Communists, insist that the United States be consulted and seek to influence the course of the negotiations." You presumably will want to discuss this comment of paragraph 7 with Admiral Radford.
In case you want to send a written, reply to Mr. Murphy we attach a draft. Note that it says you have discussed it with Admiral Radford who agrees, we have not shown it to Admiral Radford so you should do so before sending it (his office has been given a copy). Also note it questions the need for sending any such instructions on "posture" at this late date.

1.	we fully realize need for prompt decisions regarding international-izing the war. Various factors combine to suggest that it may be premature to pose issue of internationalizing for decision at this moment.
(a) If raised before French realize fully that choice is between internationalizing and virtual surrender, proposal to internationalize might well be rejected, leaving no alternative but capitulation.
■	(b) British are more likely to support or acquiesce in interven-
tion if Geneva has beeri shown to offer no prospect of solution.
(c) Australian government would almost certainly not take a position until after elections at end of May.
Even so it seems desirable for Laniel to know in general terms conditions ,we would require for intervention because of influence on current French decisions in military field in Indo-China and in political field in Geneva.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE	•
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THE DIRECTOR, FOREIGN OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION	.
SUBIECT:	Position of the United States Regarding the Provision
of Military Aid to Indochina in the Event of a CeaseFire	•
REFERENCE:	NSC Action No. 1111
The National Security Council and Mr. Tuttle for the Secretary of the Treasury at the 196th Council meeting on May 8, 1954, discussed the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the subject, and adopted the following statement of policy with respect thereto (NSC Action No. 1111):
•
In the event of a cease-fire in Indochina in advance of an acceptable armistice agreement, including international controls, the shipment of military end-items under US MDAP provided under the "Agreement for Mutual Defense Assistance in Indochina between the United States of America and Cambodia, France, Laos, and Vietnam" will immediately be suspended. In such event, the entirc question of US aid to Indochina will be re-cxamined in the light of circumstances then existing. The US also assumes that, in such event, military end-items previously delivered in Indochina by the US will be recovered or destroyed to the maximum practicable extent.
, Accordingly, the above statement of policy, as approved by the President, is transmitted herewith to the Secretary of Defense for guidance and appropriate action, and to the Secretary of State and the Director, Foreign Operations Administration for information.
It is requested that special security precautions be '	observed in the handling of the above statement on policy and that access
to it be very strictly limited on an absolute need-to-know basis.

'	A CONCEPT FOR ACTION WITH REGARD TO INDOCHINA
■	THE PRODI LN	'	.
.1. To fir.d a way to resolve the numerous conflicting factors of the Indochina problem in a way which will prcscrvc Indochina to thc frcc world.
FACTS BEARING OH THE PROBLEM	’
------------------------- ,
2.	Thc loss of Indochina to Communist control, cither by negotiation at Geneva or by force of Vietminh arms, would have grave consequences to thc free world.	,
3.	The United States might be willing to intervene in Indochina if the
•	following problems could be resolved:
■	a. Thc U.S. must not bc supporting "colonialism" in such intervention.
b. The U.S. must intervene in some sort of allied action.
p. The United Kingdom and thc Asian nations related to her, particularly India, appear to be opposing U.S. intervention. This opposition is presently being manifcsted by "Asia for Asians" proposals based on the Colombo nations . supervising and guaranteeing an Indochina settlement.
' t	,
/ .
4.	There arc two further factors bearing on U.S. intervention:
a.	The need for Congressional agreeracnt. This is at least partially contingent upon a clear resolution of the "colonialism" factor.
b.	The possibility of Red Chinese intervention. This is a somcwhat separate issue presently allowed for in NSC 5405.
5.	The U.S. is endeavoring to avoid the loss of Indochina and to resolve the colonialism problem by the creation of a regional grouping. It is not -	clear that a grouping 'adequate to resolve the colonialism problem could bc used
for intervention'in Indochina.
DISCUSSION	•
6.	To date there has been somc lack of understanding amongst our Allies, "in Europe and Asia" as to firm U.S. intentions with rcgard to Indochina. This . may arise becausc of a lack of an overall conccpt which will guide thc U.S. as . to its objcctives and actions.
7.	The following is an admittedly imperfect attcmpt to sct forth a possible conccpt.
a.	Thc U.S. is unwilling to permit the loss of Indochina to Communist
.. ।	control by witatever means.	,
.Thin docuulpnt contains pages. ’

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

b.	Tho U.S. is prcparcd to join actively in two regional groupings.
The first such grouping trill include nations ready immediately to intervene in Indochi: a providcd certain conditions arc. met. The second such, grouping should be dcfir.ccl, with. wider participation, to guarantee agaix st Communist .aggression or subvcrsion, all of Southeast Asia with thc exception of IndoChina so long as active fighting continues. «
c.	The smaller regional grouping, for active intervention, should , consist of at least the U.S., France, thc Associated States, Thailand and the Philippines. A precondition of its formation is thc absolute declaration by France of the independence of thc Associated States.
d.	Tb.c second regional grouping should be oucn to all countries who wish*~to join, including thc Colombo countries, Korea and, perhaps, the Chinese Nationalists. The Asian members, definitely including the Colombo countries, would be invited to maintain thc peace and security of the area of Indochina progressively liberated according to thc procedures set forth below.
e.	Intervention in the Indochina conflict by the first regional grouping would bc on invitation by tho Associated States. Operations would be conducted from as many Vietnam held areas as possible to destroy organized Vietminh resistance therein, and to develop a "front" which would delimit
. the ureas of independent Vietnam. These areas would be expanded, as rapidly as was consistent with the destruction of organized Vietminh forces therein. As soon as a substantial area was "liberatcd", the "active" regional grouping, i.e., thc U.S. and France, would turn over thc maintenance.of order, anti-guerrilla operations and anti-subversion to the Vietnam Government assisted by thc Asian members of the second and "pea.cefu1" regional grouping. Military installations necessary to support active combat could be kept as "enclaves" within the liberated area.
8.	The above concept, complicated though it may bc, would seem to resolve to a considerable dcgrec the problem of U.S. intervention being construed as "colonialism." It would further bc an offer to thc Colombo nations to guarantee the progrcssive settlement of Indochina by force of arms in which they are not asks 1 to participate. It would clarify to the world that the U.S. means what is has frequently said, that thc U.S. is determined that Communist expansion by aggressive force of arms shall not be permitted.
9.	The concept, to bc effective in halting the deterioration of thc free world position in Indochina and at Geneva, would need to bc publicly presented to the world, after thc decision to do so was reached by thc Executive Branch and Congress. It would have to be presented in its entirety to obtain the psychological as well as factual resolution of tho "colonial" problem.
RECOMMENDATION
10.	It is recommended that this conccpt bc given appropriatc study and further definition by the intcrcstcd Departments and Agencies.	•

FINALLY; MAURICE SCHUMANN TRANSMITTED A REQUEST OF BIDAULT’S THAT U.S. DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TH THE NEXT DAYS TO ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF PLANES AMD EQUIPMENT IN THE EVENT THAT A CEASE FIRE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED AT GENEVA WHICH WOULD NATURALLY BRING .TO A HALT SUCH DELIVERIESo
I THEN REFERRED TO QUESTION OF LOCATION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND EXPRESSED DEPT’S VIEWS IN FAVOR OF PARIS. SCHUMANN AND LAIMEL ' AGREED THAT PARIS WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO WASHINGTON AND ACC9?.?l INGLY IT CAN EE ACCEPTED AS AGREED THAT NEGOTIATIONS ALONG LINES OF REFTEL WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE IN PARIS.
I THEN OUTLINED REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN PARAGRAPHS 2 AND 3 OF REFTEL. LANIEL ANT) SCHUMANN LISTENED VERY QUIETLY AND SERIOUSLY AND ON THE WHOLE APPEARED WELL PLEASED WITH THIS CLARIFICATION OF U.S. POSITION. THEY SAID THAT NATURALLY THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY INFO REGARDING THE VIEWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE AREA AND THEY WOULD APPRECIATE BEING KEPT INFORMED BY U.S. OF PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING CONDITION INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 2(B) WHICH WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL. THEY WERE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED AND PLEASED BY INDICATION IN THAT PARAGRAPH THAT ACTUAL PARTICIPATION BY U.K* WAS NO LONGER A PREREQUISITE TO U.S. ACTIONo
LAMIEL AND SCHUMANN HAD ONE SERIOUS OBJECTION TO U.S* CONDITIONS. THIS, AS EXPECTED, WAS__T_O_THE CONDIT I OiVfHAT FRANCE PUSLLCLW ACCORD TO ASSOCIATED STATES RI GHL 0_i—U -WW- A UAL FROM FRENCH UNION AT ,ANY_.TW. ~ WHEN I EXPLAINED U.S.
REASONS FOR THIS POSITION AS OUTLINED IN DEPTEL 4064, THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE HOU SUCH A STATEMENT MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP WITH NEHRU BUT THAT FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAKE SUCH A STATEMENT WHEN IT HAD NEVER BEEN REQUESTED BY AMY OF THE THREE ASSOCIATED STATES. THEY THEN POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT THE VIET MINH ARMISTICE PROPOSALS, DISHONEST THOUGH THEY WERE, NEVERTHELESS LOOKED TOWARD THE POSSIBILITY OF THE VIETMINH JOINING THE FRENCH UNION. (COMMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT UNLESS WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO GET AROUND THIS REQUIREMENT, FRENCH WILL NEVER ASK FOR OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE.) AFTER
HEARING STRONG STATEMENT ON THE SUBJECT BY BOTH LANIEL AND SCHUMANN, I SAID THAT I HOPED WE COULD CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT IN ORDER TO FIND A FORMULA THAT WOULD SATISFY U.S. REQUIREMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME COULD BE ACCEPTED BY THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT. LANIEL AND SCHUMANN AGREED THAT WE SHOULD TALK FURTHER ON THIS SUBJECT.
LANIEL AND SCHUMANN HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION REFERRING TO SUBPARAGRAPH 2(E) WHICH STATES THAT FORCES FROM U.S. WOULD BE

PRINCIPALLY AIR AND SEA "AND OTHERS". THEY ASKED ME TO
• FIND OUT WHAT WAS MEANT BY OTHER FORCES, LANIEL INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ARTILLERY FORCES AS WELL AS SOME GROUND FORCES. IM THIS CONNECTION, THEY MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE USE OF MARINES. COMMENT: I FEEL THAT WHILE' FRENCH GOVT WOULD MOT LOOK FORWARD IN PRE-SENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE NECESSITY OF ANY SUBSTANTIAL IN- ■ VOLVEMENT BY U.S. GROUND FORCES, THEY NEVERTHELESS FEEL THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME TOKEN GROUND FORCES SO THAT OUR PARTICIPATION IS NOT LIMITED STRICTLY TO NAVAL AMD AIR FORCES.)
BOTH LANIEL AND SCHUMANN ACCEPTED WITHOUT QUESTION AS BEING WHOLLY JUSTIFIED U.S. REQUIREMENT THAT CONDITIONS BE ACCEPTED BY FRENCH CABINET AND ENDORSED BY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THEY THEN SAID THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO SPEAK TO ME OVER THE WEEKEND AFTER THEY HAD HAD TINE TO THINK FURTHER REGARDING U.S. CONDITIONS. I MADE IT CLEAR THAT CONDITIONS AS OUTLINED REPRESENTED PRESENT HIGH LEVEL THINKING IN WASHINGTON AMD DID NOT REPRESENT AS YET ANY COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF U.S.
GOVT. SCHUMANN THEN SAID THAT NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD BE PURSUED IN THE GREATEST SECRECY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS FULL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED. HE SAID THAT PREMATURE PRESS LEAKS COULD MAKE THINGS MOST DIFFICULT AND HE REFERRED TO AN AP PRESS STORY TODAY FROM WASHINGTON, LAMIEL AND SCHUMANN THEN SAID THAT THEY HOPED THAT NEGOTIATIONS COULD CONTINUE RAPIDLY AND THAT WHEN AND IF FULL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN ’REACHED, UE WOULD BE IN

_2- 0)402, May 17, 2 p.m., from Paris
The present situation, in IndOchina is in SOme wayS comparable • to that during the darkest early hears of the Korean war, when there Was treachery and disaffectien 0c all sides in SOuth Kcnea, when the lines Were being held primarily by American troops, and When a large part Of World. Opinion regarded the South K—ean Government as a US puppet. The real independence of the South Korean G-OVermreat Only became fully apparent when South Xerea came intO pcssession Of an army Of its Own capable of independent action. I feel that independence Of Vietnam will became perfectly clear after a streng national army has been created"and after the bulk, if nOt all, Of the French Expeditionary Corps has been Withdrawn.

Re DEPTEL 4130
I have been much concerned about EDC situation for some time. Two things are perfectly clear.
1.	That as long as present state of acute crisis exists regarding Indochina there is no hope of a successful debate on EDC. The singleminded effort for a period of at least two weeks of all pro-EDC elements in government will be necessary in order to have chance of ratification of EDC by French Parliament.
2.	Any attempt to force EDC to a vote before Indochina crisis has been further clarified would lead to indefinite postponement or defeat of EDC.
while pro-ECD members of French Government originally saw no connection between EDC and Geneva, the fall of Dien Bien Phu and present military crisis in Indochina has drastically changed situation. EDC is for the moment inextricably intertwined with
’ both Geneva and Franco-US negotiations regarding united action in Indochina. While there is no direct logical connection between the two, the way in which we handle present Indochina negotiations with French is bound to have great effect on our friends in French Government who are supporting EDC. The two key elements in this situation are (1) the finding of a solution to the clarification of the independence of Associated States that will not require France to publicly proclaim right of withdrawal from French union and (2) the question of Marines for Indochina as raised by Schumann in EMBTEL 4416. Unless we can satisfy this request for Marines, I am very much afraid that the emotional reaction here will be such that there will be no hope of EDC ratification at least for months to come.
* Indeed, if we PERMANENT	472

Indeed, if we fail to reach agreement with French for joint, effective and hopeful action in Indochina, the Laniel government which is living on borrowed time granted by National Assembly in the hope that, thanks to United States support, an honorable solution can be reached at Geneva, will probably fall. A government pledged to peace in Indochina at any price is then likely and such'a government is also likely to bury EDC for good. As regards Geneva, I am sure that Soviets must be well aware of the reaction of Indochina crisis on EDC situation here. Therefore, I would assume that they would, while endeavoring to appear reasonable in public and before world opinion, take action to prevent any agreement in Geneva other than ignominious surrender at least until July when there would no longer be time to debate EDC here prior to summer recess. Therefore, the only way that I can see to push EDC to a vote here with a reasonable chance of success is to bring present United States-French negotiations on Indochina to a successful conclusion in next two or three weeks. Such a result would enable us to give solid support to French at Geneva and would recreate the spirit of alliance between our two countries which has been lacking since Dien Bien Phu.
. Meanwhile, technical progress on EDC has continued. I do not consider that French have failed to live up to agreement regarding setting date for debate as Saar precondition has not yet been met. Delay on this is clearly a joint Franco-German responsibility and connot by any stretch of the imagination be imputed solely to French. There has been real progress in these negotiations which an reported are now concerned almost entirely with the two words "corresponding relations" in Article 12 of Naters’ report. Schumann told me that if Teitgen and Adenauer could not reach complete agreement at Strasbourg he expected another meeting with Hallstein. He also told me that if no new points were brought up by Hallstein, it should be possible to reach complete agreement at this next meeting. There has also been real progress on protocol signature problem as has recently been reported by Bruce mission. If Socialist Party Congress should live up to Mollet's expectations, Laniel's position regarding EDC will be greatly strengthened, not only in Parliament, but also in committees and, in particular, in Steering Committee where first test of strength will take place. MRP Congress due May 27 and 28 also expected take strong pro-EDC position.
In view of above, I feel that present is not quite the time for letter such as described in reference telegram. I feel we should concentrate our immediate efforts on conclusion of Indochina negotiations with France and on bringing about a Saar settlement and agreement on signature of the protocols, all prior to June 1.

Delivery of letter of type indicated in reference telegram at this time, in the midst of crucial France-US negotiations on Indochina, would in my opinion not have effect of exerting pressure on French, but would simply ensure defeat or indefinite postponement of EDC and would greatly strengthen group in French Government favoring peace at any price in Indochina.
By June 1 situation should be much clearer and then if, after further conversations with Laniel, there still should be no progress on EDC I feel that the time would be ripe to consider seriously the delivery of a formal letter regarding intentions to the French. Status of Indochina crisis .will, however, still have to be taken into consideration in reaching our final decision. Meanwhile I suggest that our action be.limited to oral communications by me regarding importance of EDC to Schumann or Laniel or both the next time I see them regarding Indochina.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
SUBJECT: Indo-China
1.	I am becoming increasingly concerned over the frequency of stater .ments by individuals of influence within and without the government that United States air and sea forces alone could solve our problems in Indo-China, and equally so over the very evident lack of appreciation of thc logistics factors affecting operations in that area.
2.	Indo-China is almost totally devoid of local resources which would be of use to our Armed Forces. It has a tropical, monsoon climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons and the disease and morale hazards are high for Caucasian troops, Thc population, when not hostile, is untrust-worthy. However, the principal deficiency of Indo-China as a base for thc support of large military operations lies in the inadequacy of its facilities for the movement of supplies.
3.	The two principal ports are Saigon and Haiphong, with a combined daily capacity of 15, 100 short tons. Both are inland river ports requiring considerable dredging before maximum potential can be obtained. Thcre arc nine secondary ports whose tonnage capacities vary from 100 to 1, 400 tons,
4.	Because of the inadequacies of the road, railroad, and waterway systems north from Saigon, this port would be of very little use for the sup-port of operations in thc Tonkin Delta. Haiphong could not be used without augmentation of its capacity including full use of secondary ports and all beaches. The tonnage capacity of the road and railroad system from Haiphong to Hanoi is even now less than the port capacity of Haiphong.
5.	It would bc necessary to make full use of the air for supply and evacuation as well as for tactical support. Much construction, to include lengthening and reinforcing of runways, of extreme difficulty during the rainy season, would be necessary. Only three airfields in Indo-China, Haiphong/Cat Bi, Touraue and Tan Son Nhut (near Saigon), have runways . over 7, 500 feet long and have reported pavement strengths which could sup-port B-45 bomber operations. • Eight fields can handle transport planes as large as a C-119; an additional seven fields can accommodate C-46's. Sus-tained operations could not be undertaken on most of these fields in the rainy season. Within the Delta itself; there are ten airfields of all types of . which only one, Cat Bi, is currently being used by C-H9's or C-54's.

• 6. Even were it decided to limit the employment of United States forces to naval and air, which in itself would bc a basically faulty military decision, it would devolve upon the Army to perform The bulk of the logis-tical services and it is essential that the magnitude of the effort required be clearly understood.
7.	The adverse conditions prevalent in this are?, combine all those which cor.irouted United States forces in previous campaigns in the South and Southwest Pacific and Eastern Asi?., v/ith the additional gravc ccmpli-cation of a large native population, in thousands of villages, most of which are about evenly divided, between friendly and hostile.
8.	The complex nature of these problems weld require a major United'States logistical effort. It explodes the myth that air and sea forces could solve the Indo-China problems. If United States land-based forces are projected any appreciable distance inland, as would be essential, they would require constant local security at their every location, and for their every activity. Tae Army would have to provide these forces, their total would be very large, and the time to provide them would be extensive.

Subject: U.S. Military Participation in Indochina.
1.	In recent dincunnions between the French and the Department of State relating to U.S. military interVention in Indochina, the U.S. GoVernment specified certain conditions which Would have to obtain if U.S. military LnterVention trove to bc undertaken. Among thene conditions were:
a.	That France would undertake not to withdraw its forces from Indochina during period of united action co that forces from U.S. principally air and Sea and others

b.	That agreement would hare to be reached on training of natiVe troopn and on command Structure fot’ united action.
2.	On the assumption that United States armed forcer, intervene in the conflict in Indochina, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have agreed that a Department of Dafenne position Should be formulated an to tho Size and composition of U.S. force contributions to be made and the command structure to bo OStab-linhed. In formulating these victiS the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been guided by seVeral factors, among which arc:
a.	The limited availability of U.S. forces for military action in Indochina.
b.	The current numeric.?.! advantage of the French Union forces over thc enemy, i.e., approximately 5 to 3.
_c. The undesirability of basing large numbers of U.S.
.	forces in Indochina.
d.	The primary need of an expanded and intensified training program no being thc current gveatcSt need.

e.	The lack of required facilities for superimposing U.S’. Air Force forces on existing facilities in Indochina.
f.	The implications of a reaction by thc Chinese Commu-• nists in the event of U.S. participation.
g.	Atomic weapons will bc used whenever it is to our mi11tary advantage. • <
3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the basic principle underlying any command structure for operations in Indochina which is acceptable to the United States must enable the U.S. to influence future strategy in Indochina. In addition, they believe that Some new means to furnish the military guidance which heretofore has come from Paris must bc found. A possible solution for over-all strategic guidance is a Military RcpresentatiVen Committee with membership from those nations contributing the principal forces of the coalition with a Steering or Standing group along the lines of NATO. Thin group would be Served by a staff organized along the lines of the U.S. Joint .Staff composed primarily of U.S. and French officers. • *
■	4. Although the Allied Coirmandor in Chief in Indochina
Should be French, there must be a U.S. Deputy with Sufficient otaff assistance to provide liaison With the French end coordinate U.S. activities with the over-all operations. CINCPAC would exercise command OVer all U.S. forces based in Indochina and other forces assigned to him for operations in Indochina. In addition, a. U.S. Air AdVisor would be provided the French Commander in Chief for the purpose of advioing him concerning the air effort.
5.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the best military course for eventual victory in Indochina in the development of effective native’armed forces. Thus far the French have been unsuccessful in their effoxMs to develop such forces. A firm commitment by the French end firm requests from the respective govevnmcnts of the Associated States for tho training and development of native forces by the United States should be a . prerequisite of U.S. participation. It is estimated that an . augmentation of MAAG Indochina on the order of 2250, with an appropriate logistic support force, would be required to initiate thio program. The size of thin force and security arrangements therefor will be determined in light of recommendations requeated from CINCPAC and Chief, MAAG Indochina.

6.	The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that U.S. participation be limited primarily to Naval and Air Forces. The composition of these forccs should be on the order of the following:
a.	Naval Forcer.. A fast carrier Task Force and supporting forces as” neceasaty in accordance with d.eVelopmento in thc situation.
b.	Air Forces. U.S. Air Force uni 1s operating from preaent bases outside Indochina as may be required. The order of magnitude of thin effort cannot now be estimated since it will depend on developments In the situation.
7.	The Joint Chicfn of Staff note that the principal sources of Viet Minh military supply lie outside Indochina. The destruction or neutralization of tho tie outside Bourcee Supporting the Viet Minh would materially reduce thc French military problems in Indochina.	'
8.	Tbc Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that committing to the Indochina conflict NaVal forces in excess of the above or basing substantial air forces therein will involve maldeploymcnt of
. forces and reduced readiness to meet probable Chinese Communist reaction elsewhere in the Far East. From the point of view of the United States, with reference to thc Far East as a Whole, Indochina 13 devoid of decisive military objectives and the allocation of more than token U.S. armed forces to that area vtould bc a serious diveroion of limited U.S. capabilities.

WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
21 May 1954
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Defense of Southeast Asia in the Event of Loss of Indochina to the Communists
1.	As a result of recent military and political developments, including certain public statements by high-level officials of the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that it is incumbent upon them to determine what military forces and resources would be required to hold Southeast Asia against further Communist aggression in the event Indochina is lost to the Communists.
2.	Currently approved United States Government objectives regarding Southeast Asia are based on the considerations that:
a.	The passing of the countries, of Southeast Asia into the Communist orbit would be inimical to the security interests of the United States, and
b.	The loss of Indochina to the Communist orbit could lead to the eventual loss of the other countries of South-'east Asia to the Communist orbit.
3.	In the event that Indochina is lost to the Communists, the United States must take as an objective the prevention of the loss of the rest of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Burma, and Malay) to the Communists.
z
4.	There are two basic military concepts for the defense of Southeast Asia:
a.	Static type defense (Korea type).
b.	An offensive to attack the source of Communist military power being applied in Southeast Asia.

5.	The force requirements and inherent logistic implications for a "static" defense of the remaining countries of Southeast Asia-Burma, Thailand, and Malaya are of the order of magnitude as shown in Appendices "A" and "B" hereto. So long as Burma and Thailand are not under Communist control, the geography of the area and the lack of a Chinese Communist capability for a major overseas attack renders Malaya secure from external attack. Therefore, the force requirements are limited to those necessary to defend Burma and Thailand and to provide internal security against infiltration and subversion in Malaya. Should Burma and Thailand be lost, to the Communists prior to an Allied decision to hold a line in Southeast Asia, the defensive position would have to be established in Malaya.
6.	A study of the above requirements and implications reveals the following extensive and damaging weaknesses inherent in this concept:
a.	It is estimated that it would take a minimum of 12 months to build up the necessary base complex and facilities required to support the forces indicated.
b.	These forces would have to remain for an extended period.
c.	The commitment in manpower and material incident to maintaining these forces in Southeast Asia for such a period would be unacceptable from the overall viewpoint.
d.	The presence of large numbers of United States Commonwealth, and French troops in this area would provide a basis for Communist propaganda to develop and intensify . anti-Western sentiment. .	.
e.	The dissipation of allied strength through the commitment of forces of this magnitude to a "static" defense of Southeast .Asia would contribute to the realization of the politico-military objectives of the USSR vis-a-vis the free world.
f.	Execution of static defense plan would result in maldeployment and seriously reduce the flexibility of employment of United States forces. This could seriously jeopardize the United States capability of supporting logistically our present war plans.
. 7. In view of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that from the military viewpoint the concept of a static-type defense is unsound.

8.	In stating certain implementing actions to the current military posture of the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated inter alia:
"Certain other countries such as Indochina, to which the United States has no specific commitment, are of such importance to the United States that an attack on them probably would compel the United States to react with military force either locally at the point of attack or generally against the military power of the aggressor."
It is considered that the rest of the Southeast Asian countries are included in the above category.
9.	In view of the above, the United States should adopt the concept of offensive actions against the "military power of the aggressor," in this instance Communist China, rather than the concept of "reaction locally at the point of attack," which is the thesis of the action outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.
10.	The force requirements and the logistic support for . the operations envisaged in paragraph 9 above are being considered but have not been fully developed. However, it is felt that adoption of this concept would provide a more acceptable return for the manpower and resources expended than would be the case in the concept of a static defense.
11.	Upon the decision to implement either one or the other of these courses of action, it would be necessary to insure the degree of mobilization required to take care of the increased possibility of a general war.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Studies with Respect to Possible U.S. Action Regarding Indochina
1.	Reference is made to the memorandum by the Acting Secretary of Defense, dated 18 May 1954, subject as above, wherein the Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested to prepare certain studies, and agreed outline answers to certain questions relating thereto, for discussion with the Acting Secretary of Defense on or before 24 May, and for subsequent submission to the National Security Council (NSC).
2.	a. The studies requested by the Acting Secretary of Defense were developed within the parameters prescribed in the memorandum by the Executive Secretary, NSC, dated 18 May 1954, subject as above. This memorandum is interpreted as assuming no concurrent involvement in Korea. ■	This assumption may be quite unrealistic and lead to mal-
employment of available forces. The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to point out their belief that, from the point of view of the United States, with reference to the Far East as a whole, Indochina is devoid of decisive mulitary objectives and the allocation of more than token U.S. armed forces in Indochina would be a serious diversion of limited U.S. capabilities. The principal sources of Viet Minh mili-' tary supply lie outside Indochina. The destruction or neutralization of these sources in China proper would materially reduce the French military problems in Indochina.
b. In connection with the above, it may be readily anticipated that, upon Chinese Communist intervention in Indochina, the French would promptly request the immediate deployment of U.S. ground and air forces, additional naval forces, and a considerable increase in MDAF armament and equipment. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated their

belief that committing to the Indochina conflict naval forces in excess of a Fast Carrier Task Force and supporting forces, as necessary in accordance with the developments in the situation, of basing substantial air forces in Indochina, will
involve maldeployment of forces and reduce readiness to
meet probable Chinese Communist reaction elsewhere in the Far East. Simultaneously, it is necessary to keep in mind the considerable Allied military potential available in the Korea-Japan-Okinawa area.
p. In light of the above, it is clear that the denial of these forces to Indochina could result in a schism between the United States and France unless they were employed elsewhere. However, it should be noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have plans, both approved and under consideration, which provide for the employment of these forces in combat operations outside Indochina. Nevertheless, it is desired to repeat that this particular report is responsive to the question of U.S. intervention in Indochina only.
ASSUMING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS INTERVENE
3.	Strategic Concept and Plan of Operation
Seek to create conditions through the destruction of effective Communist forces and their means for support in the Indochina action and by reducing Chinese Communist capability for further aggression, under which Associated States forces could assume responsibility for the defense of Indochina. In the light of this concept the major courses of action would be as follows:
a.	Employing atomic weapons, whenever advantageous, as well as other weapons, conduct offensive air operations against selected military targets in Indochina and against those military targets in China, Hainan, and other Communist-held offshore islands which are being used by the Communists in direct support of their operations, or which threaten the security of U.S. and allied forces in the area.
b.	Simultaneously, French Union Forces, augmented by
U.S. naval and air forces, would exploit by coordinated
ground, naval, and air action such successes as may be
gained as a result of the aforementioned air operations in order to destroy enemy forces in Indochina.

t
c.	Conduct coordinated ground, naval, and air action to destroy enemy forces in Indochina.
d.	In the light of circumstances prevailing at the time, and subject to an evaluation of the results of operations conducted under subparagraphs a and b above, be prepared to take further action against Communist China to reduce its war-making capability, such as:
(1)	Destruction of additional selected military targets. In connection with these additional targets, such action requires an enlarged but highly selective atomic offensive in addition to attacks employing other weapons systems.
(2)	Blockade of the China coast. This might be instituted progressively from the outset.
_ (3) Seizure or neutralization of Hainan Island.
(4)	Operations against the Chinese mainland by Chinese Nationalist forces.
4.	Forces Required of Each Nation Participating
The forces which would be employed under current plans during the initial phases of the above operations are those indicated in the Appendix hereto. The duration of the commitment of these forces would depend on the succes of French Union forces operations supported by U.S. naval and air operations in defeating communist forces in Indochina.
5.	Normal Service logistic arrangement for United States Forces would prevail. CINCPAC would be responsible for providing logistic support. CINCFE would assist by providing material and logistic support as mutually agreed with CINCPAC, or as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The facilities of MATS and MSTS would be made available to CINCPAC as directed. Existing U.S. bases in western Pacific are available. Bases with limited facilities in Indochina and the Philippines (other than U.S.) would be available. Effort would be made to obtain or utilize bases on Formosa, if required. The French would pro-‘ vide their own logistic support within capabilities. United States logistical support of French Union Forces and Associated States would be provided as required. The Military Assistance	. *
Advisory Group, Indochina, would coordinate and arrange for utilization of facilities and services and would provide logistic support to the United States Liaison Groups and Training Missions. In the event operations should involve the use

of NORC Forces, United States logistic support above the current NORC MDA Program would be provided. ’
6.	Plan for Command Structure
In accordance with the Unified Command Plan, CINCPAC would exercise unified command of assigned forces. He would insure the coordination of all operations in Southeast Asia and provide for the necessary ground-air coordination between French Union Forces and U.S. Navy and Air Force forces which operate in support of the land battle. In addition, CINCPAC would select targets and conduct air operations with assigned forces against military targets in Indochina and those in China which directly support Chinese Communist aggression. COMSAC would support CINCPAC in these operations, and in addition would conduct air operations to further reduce the Chinese Communists war-making capability, as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. CINCFE will continue to provide for the security of Japan and the Ryukyus in accordance with his priority mission and in addition would support CINCPAC and COMSAC in their operations as agreed mutually.
.	7. Plan for Training Native Troops
•	For the United States to initiate training of Associated
States Forces, it is estimated that approximately 2,270 U.S. personnel would be required, as an augmentation of the existing Military Assistance Advisory Group, to carry out this program. In additio, U.S. personnel would be required to provide appropriate logistic support. The exact size and composition of the training mission, the logistic support requirements, and the security requirements and arrangements till be determined in light of recommendations which have .been requested from CINCPAC and the Chief, MAAG, Indochina. The training of Associated States Forces would be patterned after the training program conducted -for RCK forces in Korea.'
8.	Plan for World-Wide Military Aid
The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that action should be taken to insure appropriate degree of mobilization to provide for the greater risk of a general war and be prudently prepared under this alternate assumption. In view of the increased risk of ’ general ■war involving the Soviet Bloc, immediate action would

have to be taken to strengthen our allies. However, due to the overriding mobilization requirements for U.S. forces, such aid would be limited to those allies who could directly support the U.S. strategic concept for general war. This aid would further be limited to combat essential material, essential replacements, and spare parts which are beyond the capabilities of the individual countries to provide from their own or other allied resources.
ASSUMING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS DO NOT INTERVENE
9.	Strategic Concept and Plan of Action
Seek to create conditions by destroying effective Communist forces in Indochina, under which the Associated States Forces could assume responsibility for the defense of Indochina. In the light of this concept, the major courses of action which would be undertaken are as follows:	•
a.	Conduct air operations in support of allied forces in Indochina. The employment of atomic weapons is contemplated in the event that such course appears militarily advantageous.
b.	Simultaneously, French Union Forces augmented by such armed forces of the Philippines and Thailand as may be committed would, in coordination with U.S. naval and Air Force forces, conduct coordinated ground, naval and air action to destroy enemy forces in Indochina.	.
10.	Forces Required of Each Nation Participating
The forces which would be employed under current plans during the initial phases of the above operation would include:
a.	French Union Forces currently operating in Indochina. • " !
b.	A U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force and supporting force: as necessary in accordance with developments in the situation.
c.	U.S. Air Force units operating from present bases outside Indochina as required.
d.	Forces as may be contributed by other friendly nations. *
The duration of commitment of these forces cannot be determined at this time.	.

11.	Plan for Logistic Support
The plan for logistic support would be the same under this asstunption as under the assumption that Chinese Communists intervene (see paragraph 5 above) — except for the last sentence of paragraph 5»
12.	Plan for Command Structure
Although the Allied Commander in Chief in Indochina should be French, there must be a United States Deputy with sufficient staff assistance to provide liaison with the French and coordinate U.S. activities with the over-all operation. CINCPAC would exercise command over all U.S. forces based in Indochina and other forces assigned to him for operations in Indochina. In addition, a U.S. Air Advisor would be provided the French Commander in Chief for the purpose of advising him concerning the air effort. This officer would have no command responsibilities but would-be under the direction of the U.S. Deputy.
13-	Plan for Training Native Troops
The plan for training native troops would be the same under , this assumption as under the assumption that Chinese Communists intervene (see paragraph 7 above).
14.	Plan for world-Wide Military Aid
a. Initially, there would be no requirement for additional material and equipment over and above current IDAP for the French and other allied forces in Indochina. MDA programs, however, would require augmentation within approximately 6 months to provide equipment and support necessary to equip initially and maintain a total of 3 new ROK-equivalent Associated States' divisions. Thereafter, increased MDA programs would be required to support additional Associated States' divisions as developed. The maximum number of such divisions probably would not exceed 20.
Ib. All other military assistance should proceed as currently programmed.
p. Current programs for equipping and modernizing U.S. forces must not be curtailed as a result of any of the foregoing.	•

METHOD OF FINANCING COMBAT OPERATIONS
15.	Whether or not the U.S. intervenes in Indochina, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that it is vital that the war in Indochina be financed by a method separate and distinct from the world-wide MDAP. It is imperative that the commander be provided with the necessary equipment to wage war effectively without the financial and legal restrictions imposed by MDAP procedures. The current practice of diverting MDA funds from approved programs to support emergency requirements such as those resulting from combat operations in Indochina has already had the effect of hindering the attainment of our worldwide strategic objectives. Only by divorcing the fluid requirements which exist in local combat situations from the normal MDA programming methods and procedures can the orderly achievement of our objectives in other world areas be achieved.

NEMOR/diDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
. • •
.	1. J. wish to aclmowlodge the receipt of your memorandum, May
25, 1954, subject: "Dofense of Southeast Asia in the Event of Loss of Indochina to the Comtmists", with an attached, memorandum
. to you from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dated May 21, 1954, same subject.
.	2. Your Memorandum indicates that the paper of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff deals with the military defense of the rest of . Southeast Asia, if Indochina is lost, "against an overt Chinese. Cormunist attack" (although these specific words are not used in the paper). Given this clarification, the paper takes the position, in the event of overt Chinese- Communist attack, that a statictype defense is militarily unsound and that' the proper concept is an offensive against Communist China.	•
' • .
3. It is clear in the current policy of the United States towards Southeast Asia that, in. the event of "overt Chinese Communist attack" against Burma, Thailand., or Malaya, the United States will "take appropriate military action against Communist China" (Paragraphs 42, 46, and 48, U5C 5405) rather than employ a static-type defense.	•
■ '
-	-4. In view of this existing policy, the Joint Chiefs’ paper
does not appear to involve a new policy issue necessarily requiring its circulation to the members of the National Security Council at the present time. On the other hand, if you feel that it would be desirable to circulate the paper on a limited basis, with an appropriate explanatory note as above, I shall be very glad t do so.

5. Ely referred to increasing frequency Of American criticism Of French COnduct of War. He explained that it Was easy tc criticize pest facto and When things Went vrcng. As Trapnell knew, the war in IndOchina vas Of a Very special nature and it Was unfair fOr people WhO perhaps didn’t understand this fact as well as he and Trapnell to criticize. It Was useless tO COmpare the wars in KOrea and IndOchina; they Were entirely different. He hoped that Trapnell could use his influence tO reduce the degree of present US criticism Of past and present French performance in IndOchina in the interests Of gOOd France-" American working relatiOns in the impOrtant jOint tasks at hand.
4. At abOut this stage Of the conVersatiOn, Ely remarked that it was Virtually impOssible tO discuss specific military queStiOns in IndOchina Without getting intO the majer political questiona including the pOssibillty of US InterVentiOn, the prcspects for a Pacific pact and the Whole questiOn Of Where the defense Of

C5. When Trapnell asked Ely What the immediate military prcspects were in the Delta, he replied that the fiVe Viet Minh divisions' released frOm Dien Bien Phu Were m.Oving rapidly fort-iard and should be at the Delta perimeter between the 10th and 15th Of Jtae.

7.	Ely’s plan for the defense of the Delta centers around the defense of What he termed the Hanoi-Haiphong axle. NO specific detail was gtvon as tO the number Of units, Where they Were tO be retained, or the exact area to be defended. He yas particularly and, nO dOubt, designedly pessimistic On the aspects fOr the defense of this axis, stating that if Hanoi had tO bo surrendered French UnlOn Forces WOuld rnOVO tO Haiphong, and if Haiphong Wore lost they Would at least be able tO tnOVe out from there tO "possibly anOther stand in the sOuth”. This, tOO, depended entirely, sacording tO Ely, on what was decided about US intervention and Other pending high-leVel politico! decisions.
8.	Trapnell pointed out that French Superiority in aviatiOn and armor COuld be extremely effective against a Viet Minh coordinated attack in the Delta because Of the terrain. Ely nOt Only admitted this fact but stated that it "is Our trump card".

When Trapnell pressed Ely for an Opinion as to What Was > required be-Ween the period Of the immediate threat and the perlOd When, it was hoped, the Vietnamese army WOuld 00 On an effectlVe footing, Ely replied that the General Was obviously .thinking Of hOw many US Marines Would be required tO assure the defence of the Delta.

DELEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
28 May 1954
Dear Admiral Davis:
Developments over the past few days very clearly indicate that we are approaching a stage in the conference where it is evident that the French are going to settle on terms which the U.S. could not, under present NSC directives, associate itself with. The British have long favored an Indochina settlement on the basis of partition. The Viet Minh in their proposals submitted at the restricted session on May 25 (TOSEC 302) made a proposal which would in effect be partition. The Russians and Chinese have, of course, supported the Viet Minh proposal. In the face of this, the French have no firm position, nor has there been an indication that they have a minimum position. As a result, I feel that we are moving toward the probability that there will be a settlement which will, directly or indirectly, result in the partition of Indochina.
I have discussed the foregoing points at considerable length with Herman Phleger and Alex Johnson. They both recognize the dangers of partition and the impossibility of supervising an armistice in Indochina. There appears to be a feeling of hopelessness inasmuch as the U.S. is not in a . position to control the situation. The U.S. position is not at all clear. Someone indicated before the conference we should be flexible - I would say we are now fluid. At the morning staff conferences, during the past two days, there have been discussions of U.S. tactics, and General Smith has indicated that the U.S. should remain firm. He has indicated, however, that we should be realistic, and face the probability that there will be some sort of a negotiated settlement which will result in a loss of at least part of Indochina, and will result in some type of partition. There has been no mention of the point at which the U.S. will disassociate itself from the negotiations. On the contrary, there have been indications that the U.S. will probably have to go along with a settlement even though it is unsatisfactory to the U.S.
Yesterday I attended a meeting with General Smith, Alex Johnson and Ambassador Heath in which we met with Eden and Bidault. The subject of discussion was Eden's proposal which he put forth at the sixth restricted session. Bidault had thoughts of his own on the subject taking a slightly different approach as you will note from the enclosed copy of his proposal. The thing I noted most in the discussion was the all-out effort that the various conferees are making to develop a position to which they feel the Communists will agree. Both Eden and Bidault referred to international supervision of the cessation of hostilities. However, it was quite clear from the discussion that neither are aware of the many difficult problems which will be involved in enforcing an armistice in Indochina. The question
498
TOP SECRET

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
TOP SECRET
was raised by one of Eden’s staff regarding the number of troops required to enforce the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. Various estimates were discussed. However, it was generally agreed that the number of troops required would be in excess of two divisions.
Since it is obvious that the conference is headed toward partition, I feel it significant to bring the foregoing information to your attention. There is very little that the Defense Department can do to influence the negotiations, since a political decision has been made that the U.S. will continue to participate even though we know that partition of Indochina, whatever form it may take, will ultimately result in its loss to the Communists. The view seems to prevail in the U.S. Delegation that there is very little the U.S. can do to influence the French and no useful purpose would be served in disassociating ourselves from the negotiations. I have little to offer in the way of recommendations. I have continued to point out the views of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of staff that from a military viewpoint a settlement in Indochina which results in leaving the Communist military forces intact will ultimately result in the loss of the area to Communist control. Also, there should be little doubt that there is no form of international supervision that will effectively stop further Communist infiltration and their eventual control of Indochina. Although there seems to be general agreement with the U.S. Delegation on these points there is a feeling that we cannot disassociate ourselves from the negotiations.
In outlining this gloomy situation I would like to mention one bright spot. As a result of your recommendations to General Smith I have been given every consideration and there has been complete cooperation. Due to the small number of U.S. representatives who can attend the restricted sessions on Indochina, I have not been to all of them. However, I have been included in all important discussions. Though there is obviously a difference in view between the Defense and State Department representatives here on Indochina, it is a frank, honest and friendly difference. I fully appreciate the State Department's difficulties, and though they share our view on what will ultimately result from partition, they feel compelled not to break with our Allies.
I shall keep you informed of further developments.
Respectfully
(Signed)

He requested a pram-pt answer so French cOuld take neceasary deciaiOn as tO whether or not tO send Ely. He Said. French had been. anxiOua for some time to initiate these military discussiOns and he hoped, that US was now ready and Willing for them tO begin.	«
During ccurse of my Visit he had a telephone COnversation with Massigli in London regarding a telegram Which Massigli had sent reportii-g on British attitude regarding Southeast Asia Pact. Schumann shewed me the telegram, key pOrtlon Of Which indicated British reluctance, as expressed by Sir iVOne Kirkpatrick tO undertake any sort Of military Operations in any purtiOn Of IndOchina, as they thought that all IndOchina, including CambOdia, was infested with COmmunists and. set it. was net practical for military Operations. Schumann was quite upset by this telegram Which he mads clear tO Massigli On the telephone, saying it Was now clear that , British were Only interested In defending Southeast Asia when questien became an immediate problem of ths Defense Of Malaya. Schumann then brought up anether question which he said vias giving great concern to PleVen- This was pessibllity Of Chinese air attack On the delta. He said that French Air Ferce has infermed PleVen that Chinese Cemmunlst planes Operating frOtn present bases had capability of remaining Otrer HanOi for 15 minutes. This WOuld be enough time to cause great destructlOn and PleVen felt that it such an attack were nOt oppesed. immediately by US jets, COmmunists in 5 he 5 days could, cause enOugh damage to make the delta effectively indefensible. Schumann wondered whether semething along follQwlng lines might be pessible. PrOVided French decided. tO strongly reinforce the delta and use ccnscripts in IndOchina, COuld the President go to-Congress and ask fOr discretionary authority tO use US air p-wer to defend the delta if it shOuld. be attacked by Chinese COmmunist planes. A request tO Congress COming after the evet would necessarily cause a few days delay whleh, in PleVen’S View, WOuld be fatal.

cculd remain OVer Haiphong fOr 20 minutes On each missiOn. A massiVO Chinese air attack (Schumann mentioned figure Of 100 planes) COuld completely kriOck Out French air capabilities in.the delta and cculd SO seriOusly damage the port Of HaiphOng that it WOuld be impossible tO COnduct a successful Withdrawal of French fcrces thrOugh the port. The less Of French air potential WOuld drastically tip the scales in faVOr Of the Viet Minh and make tOtal defeat Of French fcrces in the delta , ineVitable. It is against this eventuality that the French .’ wish tO have protectiOn. Paragraph 9 of. Embassy telegram 4605 indicates Ely's belief that he already has COmmitment frem Admiral Radford On this type Of attack. What French feel they are asking fcr new is nOt, in fact, a new COmmitment frem US but assurances that US reaction Will COtne Within a matter Of hOurs and eVen, if pcssible, in time tO meet attacking Chinese planes. Schumann said he felt that Only circumstances in which Chinese wOuld make such an attack wOuld be if they felt that US, fcr One reasOn Or another, was net in a pOsiticn tO respond prOmptly and effectively. ThsrefOre, Schumann Suggested that if it sbOuld be impracticable tO Obtain preliminary apprOval Of such military actiOn frem US Congresa, it might be equally useful tO haV© a clear Warning frOtn either thc Secre-„tary Or the President that a massiVO Chinese air attack WOuld
meet with US Opposition. Schumann said he felt certain that if Chinese realized that an air attack Would cause US interventiOn they WOuld never take the risk Of mOunting such an attack.
I haVe previOUsly stated tO Department that if ve allOwed delta to fall tO the Viet Minh Without a successful ewacuatiOn Of the French expeditionary Cer-ps, the effect her-c WOuld be disastr-Ous. If such a disaster should cOme abcut because Of Open Chinese Communist air attack tO Which we had nOt responded by US military aCtiOn, the result here WOuld be nOthing shOrt Of catastrOphic. We would have to count On a strOng moVement in France that cOuld well be successful in faVOr Of making peaee at any price with the Scviets rather than COntinuing tO count cn US support through NATO. The effect Of such actiOn by France On the North Atlantic Alliance is ObViOas„ In additiOD, I dO nOt feel that ve COuld exclude pOSsibility, if the SOViets play their cards right, Of a pOpular Trent gOVern-trent.arising tO carry Out such a new pOlicy. This naturally WOuld incur the danger Of an eVentual COmmunist take-OVer in France. I dO nOt hauc any means Of eValuatlng effect in Asia Of a unilateral US response tO a Chinese attack, but Department shOuld be constantly aware that lack Of US respOnse tO a full-scale Chinese COmmunist air attack On the delta wOuld place in jeopardy the North Atlantic Allianee and Our whole pOsiticn in Western EurOpe.	• •

WHEN TRAPNELL AND I ARRIVED AT LANIEL'S HOUSE FOR MEETING THIS MORNING, WE FOUND MAURICE SCHUMANN AND ELY ALSO PRESENT. THE MEETING WAS SHORT AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT ELY WOULD GO
14091
May 31, 1954 9=32 A.M.
TO WASHINGTON FOR BILATERAL MILITARY TALKS. HIS MISSIONS WILL OSTENSIBLY BE TO ATTEND FIVE-POWER MILITARY TALKS, AND IT IS FULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WILL REMAIN SECRET. ELY IS UNABIE TO ARRIVE WAS1HNGTON THIS WEEK AND VALLHY HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO REPRESENT HIM BOTH AT FIVE-POWER TALKS AND AT COMMENCEMENT OF BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WHICH ELY STATED HE UNDERSTOOD WERE TO COVER TRAINING OF LOCAL TROOPS, COMMAND STRUCTURE AND WAR PLANS. VALLUY WILL ATSO ARRANGE DATE FOR ELY'S ARRIVAL WITH JCS. ELY SAID HE WAS GOING LONDON TOMORROW FOR ONE DAY VISIT WITH HARDINE WHOM HE DOES NOT RPT NOT KNOW WELL, FOR PURPOSE OF MAKING FRIENDLY CONTACT PRIOR TO OPENING OF FIVE-POWER TALKS.
LANIEL ONCE MORE MENTIONED FRENCH FEAR OF CHINESE COMMUNIST AIR ATTACK. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT FRENCH REGARD PRESENT BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS AS A PRECLUDE TO U.S. INTERVENTION SHOULD GENEVA FAIL OR SHOULD COMMUNISTS DRAG NEGOTIATIONS AT GENEVA WHILE ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN A MILITARY DECISION IN THE DELTA. ON THE OTHER HAND, LANIER CLEARLY CONSIDERS THAT AN ALL-OUT AIR ATTACK ON THE DELTA BY THE CHINESE, WHILE NOT RPT NOT LIKELY, IS A POSSIBILITY AND SHOULD BE PLANNED FOR.
HE FEELS THAT SUCH AN ATTACK WOULD COMPLETELY CHANGE THE PRESENT SITUATION AND WANTS THE BEST ASSURANCES POSSIBLE OF PROMPT U.S.HELP IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A CHINESE ATTACK. ELY CONFIRMED THAT HIS UNDERSTANDING WITH RADFORD ON THIS SUBJECT WAS PURELY A TECHNICAL ONE BETWEEN CHIEFS OF STAFF AND WAS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL DECISION BY U.S. HE SAID THAT RADFORD HAD PLANS READY SO THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE COULD COME VERY RAPIDLY ONCE THE POLITICAL DECISION HAD BEEN MADE. I INFORMED LANIEL THAT AFTER MY MEETING WITH SCHUMANN SATURDAY NIGHT AT WHICH SCHUMANN HAD RAISED THE SUBJECT, I HAD SENT AN INQUIRY ON' SUNDAY TO WASEUNGTON EXPLAINING IN FULL FRENCH VIEW THAT (1) U.S. INTERVENTION BECAUSE OF CONTINUATION AND AGGREVATION OF PRESENT MILITARY SITUATION IN INDOCHINA, AND (2) U.S.

REACTION TO AN ALL-OUT CHINESE AIR ATTACK WERE TWO VERY SEPARATE PROBLEMS, AND THAT SOME ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE MADE TO HANDLE A CHINESE AIR ATTACK IF IT SHOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO CREATION OF A SEATO ALLIANCE.
IF WE SHOULD INFORM THE FRENCH THAT WE WILL NOT RPT NOT REACT TO A CHINESE AIR ATTACK EXCEPT AFTER MAKING THE NECESSARY ARRANGE-MENTS FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION, I AM AFRAID THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A PROFOUND AND IMMEDIATE EFFECT BOTH ON FRENCH ATTITUDE IN GENEVA AND ON PRESENT FRENCH PLANS FOR BOLSTERING THE DEFENSE OF INDOCHINA. WE GAVE LANIEL GENERAL TRAPNELL’S OPINION THAT ELY’S OVERALL PLAN SEEMED GOOD AND THAT FRENCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD AREAS WHICH ELY PLANS TO DEFENS.

1.	Maintain positicn Outlined in paragraph 3 of DEPTEL 4094. In this eVent'French will continue tO belieV© in their hearts that President will in fact request Congress tO act if there should be an all-Out Chineae air attack.
2.	Tell French that if there shOUld be such unproVOked attack, President wculd expect tO request Congress fcr authcrity tO use U.S. fOrces.	.
5. Tell French that U.S. WOuld nOt COtne tO French assistance eVen in the eVent Of a Chinese air attack except as a part' Of a collectiVe actiOn.	. .
If in fact -intention is tO glVe assistance tO French in eVent Of a Chinese air attack, it WOuld seem immaterial Whether We fcllOw cOurses No. 1 or NO. 2 and I can see many reasens in faVcr of sticking tO cOurse NO. 1. HcweVer, if We stick tO COurse No. 1, and then dO net ccme tO assistance Of French in the eVent Of a Chinese air attack, I feel that the results here in France will be as Outlined in EM3TEL 460).
TherefOre, if we dO nOt intend tO react tO Chinese air attack except in the framework Of COllectlve actiOn, I feel that it WOuld be better to adept COurse NO. 3 SO as tO aVOld the risks described in EMBTEL 460). If we adept cOurse NO. 5, hOweVer, we must realize that it will cOtne as* a shOck tO the F-ench and vrould probably haoe a prOT.pt and sericus effect On French attitude in GeneVa and On present French plans fOr relnfOrcing Indcchina. If it became public knowledge that cOurse No. 5 Was Our pOlicy, it WOuld prObably hasten fall Of Laniel and generally militate against'Our European pOlicy, thOUgh newhere nearly tO the extent indicated in EMBTEL 4607.
When Ely arriues WashingtOn next Week, he will be under specific instructions to attempt tO clarify U.S. pOlicy On this pOint if answer has nOt preVious?.ybeen giVen. Therefore, if Our de- ■ cision is,tO stick tO pOlicy Outlined in paragraph J Of DEPTEL 4O>4 with no further ezplanaticns, all personnel who will be talking with Ely shOuld be carefully briefed regarding the subject.	.

SUMMARY OF STUDIES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
•I 1. There are three parts to the State study:
a.	Economic warfare against Communist China.
b.	U.N. action in the event of U.S. armed intervention in Indochina.
c.	Juridical relations to the French Union: Giving effect to the independence of the Associated States.
2.	Economic warfare against Communist China.- The paper seeks to determine whether, in the event of U.S. intervention in Indochina, intensified and broadened economic warfare measures would deter Communist China from openly intervening or hinder its military effort if it did intervene. The study concludes that the divisive risks of seeking an international program of broadened and intensified economic warfare measures against Communist China would be too great to be undertaken if the full support of the United Kingdom were absent. Even such a program as could be obtained with United Kingdom support would nevertheless not constitute a serious deterrent or countermeasure to open Communist Chinese intervention in Indochina in terms of economic impact. It
. might be possible, however, to achieve some deterrent psychological impact through the device of an advance multilateral declaration of the economic consequences of massive Chinese Communist intervention.
y—s
The paper does not deal with the question of a naval blockade, which State considers to be a military measure.
3-	U.N, action in the event of U.S, armed intervention in Indochina -with the exception of action under Article 51 (individual or collective defense against "armed attack") the U.S. as a U.N. member is obligated not to use armed force except in response to orders or recommendations of the U.N. Therefore, "united action" without prior U.N. authorization would have to be taken under Article 51.
There are three possible types of U.N. action related to united action":
a.	U.N. action prior to U.S. intervention, designed to lay the foundation for "united action."
b.	U.N. action following and supplementing the "united action."
c.	Possible U.N. action in the event the Chinese Communists resumed hostilities in Korea as a result of "united action" in Indochina.

4. Jurdical relations in the French Union: Giving effect to the independence of the Associated States - Our goal here must be to have France make it unmistakably clear to world opinion, and above all, the Vietnamese that the Treaty of Independence between France and Vietnam represents a full and unqualified commitment on the part of France which will be carried out in practice. Since the peoples of the Associated States are still mistrustful of French promises, French actions must be underwritten by the U.S.

MEMORANDUM FOR BRIGADIER GENERAL BONESTEEL
SUBJECT: Comments on Study of Possible U.S. Action Regarding Indochina.
Pursuant to your memorandum dated 4 June 1954, the following comments are submitted:
a.	Economic Warfare Against Communist China.
1.	It is noted that this paper does not deal with the question of a naval blockade. This office has no comment on the non-military economic warfare measures discussed in this paper.
2.	Despite the improbability of obtaining agreement of all the important allies of the United States to a full economic embargo of goods and services to Communist China, it is recommended that the United States should attempt to obtain such agreement in the event of further involvement in Indochina.
3.	We should maintain that a total naval blockade would be the only effective economic warfare measure against Communist China.
b.	United Nations Action in the Event of United States Armed Intervention in Indochina
1.	No comment except that paragraph 3 has been overtaken by events.
p. Juridical Relations in the French Union: Giving Effect to the Independence of the Associated States of Indochina
1. Concur.
d. JCS paper "Studies With Respect to Possible United States Action Regarding Indochina"
1. Concur wholeheartedly in the entire paper.

The interest of thc Department of Defense in the logal conclu-siohs summarized above would appear to he far lass than that of the Stale and Justice Departments. So long as the action taken is broad enough in scope to permit the Department of Defense to carry out the responsibilities which wi 11 be assigned to it, there would appear to be no grounds for objecting to the conclusions offered. This study concludes that the wartime power of the President ray bo exercised in a state of emergency and that the proposed Resolution provides a political solution of the constitutional question which is broad enough to cover a possible extension of hostilities. Theso arc the principal points of concern to tho Defense Department and since I agree with these conclusions, end also with the practical conclusion regarding the Rod Cross, Prisoncr-of-’. cr, and rotated conventions, it seems to me that there is no reason for this Department to challenge the conclusions of the memorandum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, I venture to offer two comments on the general problem presented. FirSt, it seams to ms that ths term "intervention" might just as well be avoided altogether. It nov; appears prominently throughout the Dapartment of Justice study, but not in the draft resolution. The political connotations of the v.ord are, as you know, the subject of much anti-Amarican.comment in Central and South America. Moreover, apart from this, as a matter of technical international law tha word inplieS a dictatorial 1/ interference in tho affairs of another state. I understand there is no thought of going into Indochina except on the basis of an invitation on the part of the lawful recognized government. Our action would not, therefore, bs "intervention" in tho strict sense of the term as uSsd in international law.	.
I recognise that tho word "inter;ention" does not now appear in tho text of the draft Joint Resolution'and it seams to me, for the reasons set forth above, that it should not appear, sithsr there or in the public declarations of Administration spokesmen.
.1/ Thus Professor Oppenheim states: "But it must be emphasised that intervention proper is always dictatorial interference, not interference pure and simple. Thsrefore intervention must neither bo confused with good officeS, nor with mediation, nor with interces-.	sion, nor with co-operation, becauSa none of theso imply a dicta- •
torisl interference. Thus, for example, in 1826, at the request of the Portuguese C-overnr.ent, Great Britain sent troops to Portugal in order to assist that Government against a threatening revolution on tho part of tha followers of.Don Miguel; and in 1849, at the reouest of A.ustria, Russia sent troops into Hungary to assiSt .Austria in suppressing tho Hungarian revolt."

Second, I think it preferable that' the word "justified" be used in place of the word "authorized" in both paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft Joint Resolution. The Joint Resolution of Congress approving President wilson*s action at the time of the Tampico incident designedly employed the word "justified" in order to avoid the implication that Congress was exercising the power which it alone has to declare war. 2/ Moreover, I have taken the position internally within the Department of Defense that, as a matter of constitutional law, the President has authority to use the armed forces to repel aggression abroad without specific approval from the Congress where the circumstances of the situation require it. If this draffJoint Resolution is passed in its present form it will be a precedent for the proposition that the President must under the Constitution have an authorization from the Congress before he can use the armed forces to repel aggression abroad in cases of this sort in the future where the time element may be even more critical than in the present case.
I think the first of these two points is worth mentioning. I think the second is worth pressing for.

SUI-3 LARY-OF III.
STUDY BY THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OF COiKUNIST CAPABILITIES IN INDOCHINA
1. Comunist capabilities to oppose U.S, armed intervention in Indochina are estimated on two assumptions: (a) Viet Minh alone, receiving indirect Chinese Communist aid; and (b) Chinese Communist and Viet Minh forces receiv-
■ ing Soviet support. However, this stndy_doas not consider the effect on enemy capabiliti-s.ofUR. con:mm— -ciion or of enr-y action not directed against Indochina. This assumption is very misleading, especially in view of the fact that national policy toward Southeast Asia (NSC 9405) in the event of Chinese Communist intervention calls for U.S. military reaction not limited to the area of Indochina.
’.	2. Under assumption (a) (Viet Minh alone), the Viet Minh will be capable
of:	"	•
' ■
a.	Maintaining guerrilla warfare throughout Indochina and mounting attacks in northern Indochina with a force of up to six divisions - almost complete logistic dependence on Chinese Communists.
b.	Expanding the present combat forces of 290,000 by an additional ; 190,000.	•»
c.	Making air fields available, although thc Viet Minh do not possess an air force.
d.	Negligible naval activity.	'
•	e. Regarding political warfare, appealing to nationalism and denounc-
ing U.S. intervention as colonialism: subverting and intinidatir- the Indochinese people. In spite of Allied victories, a hard core of Communists would remain.	•	•	•
3.	Under assumption (b) (Chinese intervention), the Chinese Communists will be capable of:	•
a.	Committing five of their thirteen armies (36,000 men each) within 10-20 days. * •
b.	Supporting Communist cotfoat forces, over present linos of communications, of 600,000 men. This capability exists in the dry or rainy season.	•
c.	Intervening immediately with an air force of 120 aircraft (fighter •	and bomber).	.
d.	Limited naval activity.
e.	Regarding political warfare, infiltrating and conducting guerrilla warfare in support of Viet Minh activities.’

SUMMARY OF SECTION IV
STUDY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
This study is based on the assumption that there will be no concurrent U.S. involvement in Korea. It points out that from the point of view of the U.S., Indochina is devoid of decisive military objectives and that, consequently, the committing to the Indochina conflict of naval forces in excess of a Fast Carrier Task Force and supporting forces, as necessary in accordance with the developments in the situation, or basing substantial air forces in Indochina, will involve mal-deployment of forces and reduced readiness to meet probable Chinese Communist reaction elsewhere in the Far East.
Assuming the Chinese Communists intervene, we should, inter alia, employ atomic weapons, whenever advantageous, conduct air operations against military targets in Indochina, China, and Communist-held offshore islands, blockade the China coast, seize or neutralize Hainan, and have Chinese Nationalist forces undertake operations against the mainland. In accordance with the Unified Command Plan, CINCPAC would exercise unified command of assigned forces. To train Associated States Forces, approximately 2,250 U.S. personnel would be required to augment the existing MAAG. Meanwhile, action should be taken to insure an appropriate degree of U.S. mobilization to provide for the greater risk of a general war, and we should undertake to strengthen those allies who could directly support the U.S. strategic concept for a general war.
In the event the Chinese Communists do not intervene, we should, inter alia, conduct air operations in support of allied forces in Indochina, employing atomic weapons if such a course appears militarily advantageous. Although the Allied Commander-in-Chief should be French, there should be a U.S. Deputy and a U.S. Air Adviser. CINCPAC would exercise command over all U.S. forces based in Indochina and other forces assigned to him for operations in Indochina. The plan for training native troops would be the same as under the assumption of Chinese Communist intervention.	I
whether or not the U.S. intervenes in Indochina, the UCS conslder that it is vital that the war in Indochina be financed by a method separate and distinct from the world-wide MDAP.

SUMMARY OF ODM STUDIES RE MOBILIZATION PLANS IN THE EVENT OF U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN INDOCHINA WITHOUT CHINESE INTERVENTION (SITUATION A) OR WITH CHINESE INTERVENTION (SITUATION B)
GENERAL --------
The need for mobilization actions depends far more on the induced effects of public interpretation of events than on the direct impact of military outlays. The expectations and interpretations of the public will lead to serious economic consequences unless offset by appropriate government action. The increased direct effects of the military programs would be moderate for either Situation A or B in FY 55 and FY 56. The induced effects of either situation could have a very serious result particularly on price level and less seriously on the supply and distribution of materials. They would have only a slight effect on overall manpower availability. The measures which ODM proposes are most comprehensive in the field of stabilization and least so in manpower.
INDUSTRIAL MOBILIZATION
1.	The Defense Materials System will continue to be a key element in industrial mobilization.
2.	The rate of stockpile accumulation for a selected few critical ' materials will be protected.
.	3. Inventory controls will be imposed in both Situations A and B.
4.	Funds will be requested to erect plants and acquire equipment to overcome deficiencies in the mobilization base.
5.	Preparatory work for more serious military conditions will go forward.
MANPOWER MOBILIZATION
1.	The potential supply of military manpower available in the selective service pool and military reserves is sufficient to meet anticij/ated requirements under Situation A or B. However, certain policies and actions would be required to meet the demands of Situation B. Briefly they are:
a.	Statutory authority for involuntary recall or reservists.
b.	Statutory authority for extension of terms of service. • c. Elimination of fatherhood as a basis for deferment.

1.	The objectives of the plan for economic and technical aid to the countries of Southeast Asia in the event of U.S. action in Indochina would be (a) to gain the support and cooperation of the indigenous peoples, (b) to strengthen tlieir ability to support the mi1i.ta.ry effort, and. (c) to strengthen allied appeal to neutral or hostile indigenous peoples.
2.	The magnitude of the aid is dependent on the size of the area open to operations, the speed with which developments take place and. the outcome of the military activity. Tae type of program would be determined largely by the degree of stability in the area involved.	•	.
3.	a. Activities necessary whether conditions are stable or unstable: those which supplement the.war effort or contribute directly to the needs of the people; activities involving economic control.	.

2.	Highlights of the various plans are as follows:
a.	Maxiruri support for U.S. intervention from the indigenous peoples should be achieved by clarifying for them the issues involved.
b.	There should be established ir. Southeast .Asia, probably at Bangkok, ■ a council of representatives of all members of the regional grouping.

2. The Acting ASD (Comptroller), whose comments are attached as Tab B, feels that the sums for economic aid appear excessive in relation to the mutual military assistance pro-ram. He further notes an increase in addi-• tional new obligational authority for "economic stabilisation, selective service, stockpiling, etc.," write the amount of additional funds for stockpiling is not known. He makes the point that there is serious doubt whether the U.S. should accelerate its stockpiling program in the event of U.S. action in Indochina, or whether the stockpile should be immediately utilized. He questions whether the several agencies contributing studies have based their programs and program estimates on the same policy guidance.

for signature. Likewise Vietnamese experts, feeding at the flesh pots, have shown no alacrity in pressing for final action. It is not enought to broadcast a fine-sounding treaty of independence without knowing exactly where Vietnamese will find themselves in respect of control of their finances, their courts, and their right to request technical assistance from any quarter, and not exclusively from France.
As for question of elections to which Department quite rightly attaches importance, it is now of less significance in Vietnam than before owing to general feeling of panic and anxiety lest entire country be lost through unfortunate armistice terms. Press has announced that decrees will presently be signed by Bao Dai providing for municipal elections and, with exception of Saigon-Cholon, for direct election of mayors. This should to some extent meet Department's requirement in this regard although it is far less than national elections or preparations for National Constituent Assembly.
Upon DeJean's return from north today, I plan to discuss with him measures which should be taken locally as suggested numbered paragraph 6. I intend to suggest to DeJean necessity of pro-viding Vietnamese administrators and technical experts with know-how derived from actual participation in the affairs of government. Likewise, Department heads and Ministers should be given greater opportunity to participate in forward planning as this will result in sense of responsibility to the nation which has heretofore been lacking. Another suggestion which has frequently been advanced is that French, by turning over Norodom Palace to Vietnamese, would give graphic evidence of their intention to retire from this country and to confirm Vietnamese independence. Main question, however, would be whether Chief of State would return to occupy Palace.

Nevertheless, it seems clear UK and French will not agree to move along in SC ;ntil we have reached understanding on this question. SECTO 366 and SECTO 371 indicate language included TOSEC 229 and in Thai speech to SC June 3 should meet Eden's desire that resolution not specifically (repeat specifically) extend scope of POC beyond Thailand, while allowing actual observation to be extended later without further SC or GA action. However, French delegation in NY has firmly contended sub-commission must be restricted to Thailand alone while British were most concerned that there be no immediate request by Laos and Cambodia for observation.
Since we now desire quick action, suggest you meet with Eden, Prince Wan and Bidault to work out agreement which will permit delegations in NY to press matter in SC. Hope we could get their agreement next meeting of SC should be held preferably Friday and certainly not later than Monday or Tuesday, June 14 or 15. Possibly they would agree on text contained TOSEC 229.

I sav Schumann yesterday afternOOn end endeaVOred tO explain tO him cur need fcr a French statement as tO hOW they prOpcaed tc handle their actions as described in sOCOnd paragraph Of reference Department telegram. Schumann had difficulty understanding just vhat it was We Wanted at this time as he cOnsldern that the basis for an agreement in principle has’ been reached and that it vas impossible to go further until thc GeneVa conference had definitely failed. He pOinted cut that since the basic US re-a.uirement Was that any French request fOr military assistance must be apprOVed by the French Parliament, such a request cculd nOt (repeat net) be made While there Was any hOpe fcr progress at GeneVa because Of the strOng feellng_-n tho Parliament that everything pOsslble shOuld"be dOne-tO reach an agreement at GeneVa.

He then told me that Under Secreaty apparently egr-eed that agreement had been reached in principle and he read me a telegram from Bidault reporting same COnversatlOn as that repOrted in DIJLTE 1P6..

Paragraph 4. No difference. Schumann however pointed out the great importance of this change of wording as "the end of hostilities" could well be interpreted to mean a state of armistice, whereas what was really meant was that troops should only be withdrawn after peace had been established. The whole Viet Minh effort has been to reach some sort of armistice that would force the withdrawal of the French troops and leave the country to them.
Paragraph 5. No difference. However, Schumann stated that he had told Bidault prior to his interview with Under Secretary that he felt that near language suggested by French was too broad and that US would require more specific pledge. Bidault reported that Schumann had guessed ■wrong as Under Secretary had seen no (repeat no) difficulties in proposed language pointing out that conditions named in new draft were inherent in sovereignty of any great power. Bidault also reported Under Secretary had said he would refer this language to Department for final decision.
Paragraph 6. No difference.
Schumann then stated that in view of meeting of minds between Bidault and Under Secretary he was sure that with the possible ' exception of new wording suggested in paragraph 5 of DULTE 156, there were no (repeat no) political differences between us. He then said that he had just received a very disturbing cable from Bonnet. Before he could read it to me a call came through on the telephone from Bonnet in which they talked further about the same subject.
Subject is Valluy’s negotiations regarding use of US Marines. Valluy has reported to Pieven and Bonnet that it is very doubtful if US would agree in any circumstances to sending a Marine division to Indochina. I pointed out to Schumann that US response on this subject had never been blanket pledge to use Marines but had only stated that their use would not (repeat not) be excluded provided an agreed upon war plan required their presence. I further said that it would depend upon the war plan which Valluy submitted as to whether or not our JCS would be convinced that Marines should be committed. Schumann said he fully understood this and would explain it further to Pleven, but no emphasized crucial importance this matter.
Comment: As I pointed out in EMBTEL 4503 French military have assumed that any war plan which was satisfactory to our JCS would show necessity for the use of at least one Marine division, while from our point of view this problem quite properly should be judged on its military merits, we must realize that it also has strong political aspects here and that French Parliament in my opinion will not (repeat not) in any circumstances vote to ask

Thus, mOst crucial part Of preaent Francc-US negotiatiOns frOtn both military and political pOint Of Vleu WOuld seem tO be COnVersaticns Valluy is carrying On at Pen.tagOn.

He said he had received telegram from Maurice Schumann expressing excitement and dismay at information from Valluy that Radford had said there was no rpt no question of utilization Marines Indochina. Ambassador said this conflicted with what French Govt had hitherto understood to be intentions US Govt this respect. He further stated suggestion made by Radford to
Valluy that three Korean divisions might be uscd in Indochina was unacceptable.
•	Secretary said US position had been clear from start and that we were
not rpt not willing to make commitment ahead of time which French could use for internal political maneuvering or negotiating at Geneva and which would represent a kind of permanent option on US intervention if it suited their purpose. A month ago, French had been explicltly informed conditions which must J>e met and fulfilled by them before President took decision whether to go to Congress and ask for authority use American armed forces in relation Indochina. Among these conditions was need for French and Associatcd States to request US and certain other interested countries to come in. we were still in dark as to what French intentions really were. ■

QUOTE: I have not yet made a survey of the military situation, especially in Tonkin. However, it seems to me that the decision I will have to take regarding the operations will rest on the US intentions, in the present situation, as well as those they anticipate in the future.
QUOTE: Therefore, I would very much like to have, either in I^ris, where I expect to be possibly on the 19th June, or here in Saigon, as soon as possible an exchange of views with a qualified representative of Admiral Radford, in order to know what I can expect on the part of the U.S.A. UNQUOTE.
Prior to French decision to request internationalization, we consider undesirable to start yet another scries conversations which would inevitably provoke on French side all kinds hopes and interpretations with regard basic issue US intervention which would only cause further confusion. In other words, it is our feeling that we should not be eased into a series of piecemeal commitments resulting from collateral military conversations in the

COMMUNIST REACTIONS TO CERTAIN US COURSES
A
THE PROBLEM
To estimate Chinese Communist and Soviet reactions to the courses of action and consequent situations indicated below?
THE ESTIMATE
PART I
ASSUMPTION'S
A. The treaties of independence between France and the Associated States will have been signed.
' B. A regional security grouping including at least the Associated States, Thai. land, the Philippines, Australia, France, and thc United States, and possibly including also New Zealand and the United Kingdom, will have been formed.
C.	The Associated States will have publicly requested the direct military participation of members of the regional grouping in the war in Indochina.
D.	The French will have undertaken to continue at least the present level of their military commitment in Indochina.
REQUIREMENT 1
* To estimate the initial Chinese Communist and Soviet reactions to the participation of US air and naval forces with French Union forces and token Thai and Philippine forces in coordinated ground, naval, and air operations designed to destroy the Communist mili-

tary forces in Indochina. Air operations would be limited to targets in Indochina Nuclear weapons would be employed if their use were deemed militarily advantageous but nuclear attacks on the Indochinese civil population as a tai get system zoould be avoided
Chinese Communist Reaction
1. Thc intervention of US and'allied forces in Indochina probably would cause the Chi-ncse Communists to believe that sooner or later they would have to decide whether to

and naval forces could not, in thc absence of US ground forces, decisively altcr the course of thc war. They might therefore consider their intervention unnecessary at this point and might postpone final decision as to their course of action until they had observed thc initial scale and success of thc allicd military operations and had estimated the probable nature and extent of US aims in thc conflict.
4.	In this connection, US use of nuclear weapons in Indochina would tend to hasten the ultimate Chinese Communist decision whether or not to intervene. It would probably convince the Chinese Communists of US determination to obtain a decisive military victory in Indochina at whatever risk and by whatever means, and of the consequent danger of nuclear attack on Communist China. Whether this conviction would precipitate or deter Chincse Communist intervention would depend on the military situation in Indochina at the time, the observed military effect of the use of nuclear weapons, and thc observed political and psychological effect of such use, particularly its effect on the coherence of the regional security grouping and the Atlantic
• alliance.	.
5.	In any case, the Chinese Communists would almost certainly greatly increase their logistic support, delivery of arms and equin-ment, and technical assistance to thc Viet Minh. The Chinese Communists would probably increase their deliveries of AA weapons and might send in Chinese AA gun crews. Moreover, the Chinese Communists would probably deploy ground and air units near the Indochina border in order: (a) to warn
• the US and its allies, and (b) to have forces ready either to intervene on bchalf of the Viet Minh or to defend the southern border of China.
6. While maintaining a posture of military readiness, the Chinese Communists would intensify political and propaganda activities designed to exploit anti-Western and anticolonial feelings of the indigenous population of Indochina and the war-fears of neutralist Asian nations and of certain US allies. They would also seek to label the US as an aggressor. In tho meantime and throughout’ the

accept the defeat of. the Viet Minh or to in-terverie in force in order to try to prevent such dcfcat. Their decision would probably rest mainly, though not exclusively, upon their ■ weighing of the risks and disadvantages arising from thc Viet Minh defeat against thc likelihood of involvement in major war with thc US and thc probable conscquences of such a war for Communist China. Available evidence gives no unmistakeablc indication of what the Chinese Communist decision would bc. On balance, however, we believe that the chances arc somewhat better than even that i the Chinese Communist would decide to take • whatever military action they thought required to prevent destruction of thc Viet Minh, including when and if necessary, open use of
' I Chinese Communist forces in Indochina.2 3
’ 2. Thc nature of the assumed US action is such that ample warning would almost certainly bc given in advance of actual operations. Thc Chincse Communists have the capability now to intervene quickly and in ■ such forcc as to drive French Union forccs out of the Delta. Thc Chinese Communists might choose to exercise this capability before US intervention could be efTected. •
3. AVc believe it somewhat more likely, however, that even if the Chincse Communists had determined not to accept the defeat of the Viet Minh they would not intervene openly immediately following the assumed US intervention. They might estimate that US air
•The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Stall, recommends deletion of the last sentence of this paragraph and would substitute the fol. lowing:
“However, their decision would be largely determined by the Chincse estimate of the probable extent and effect of US initial action.”
’The Director of Intelligence, USAF, believes that the last sentence of this paragraph should read as follows:	•
"Communist China will probably not choose knowingly any course of action likely to expose its fundamental national strengths in war with a major power. However, we believe that Communist China's strength for conducting various kinds of warfare is such, and the motives and judgment of its leaders are Such as to make Communist China’s courses of action dangerously unprcdictnbte under outside pressure of any ap-prcciablc magnitude.”

period of military operations, the Commu-nists would almost certainly agitate and prop-agandize for a “cease-fire” and political settle-ment, which would preserve the Communist position and prospects.
Soviet Reaction
7.	In the assumed situation, the USSR probably would estimate that the US action, though limited to air and naval forces, would considerably increase the risks of unlimited war between the US-and Communist China. The USSR would probably prefer that such a war not develop out of the Indochina situa-tion. Nevertheless, the USSR would assure Communist China of continuing military assistance. The USSR would also give com-plctc diplomatic and propaganda support to Communist China and the Viet Minh regime.

Chinese Communist Reaction
8.	As statcd-in Paragraph 1, we believe that thc chances are somewhat better than even that the Chinese Communist, in thc assumed situation, would intervene militarily to pre-vent the destruction of the Viet Minh, lf they decided ’to do so, we believe that the exact timing and nature of their action would depend on various factors, but principally on the scope and character of thc US/allied opcr-ations they were seeking to counter.3 0
Soviet Reaction
9.	In this assumed situation, thc USSR would probably continue to support the Chinese Communists. If the Chinese Communists intervened openly in support of thc Viet Minh, the USSR would rapidly increase military assistance to Communist China. The Soviet diplomatic and propaganda campaigns against’ the US would continue full-scale, and the USSR might ask the UN to condemn the US as an aggressor. Thinly veiled threats of So-viet involvement in the fighting and refer-ences to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1950 would multiply.
•The Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Department of the Army, believes that the results in this re-quirement could not be achieved by thc unbal-anced and insufficient forces envisaged.
5 The Director of Intelligence, USAF, believes that this paragraph should read as follows:

•The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Stall, believes that paragraph 8 should read as follows:
"Communist China would conclude from the assumed impending destruction of Communist force's in Indochina, by limited forces employing nuclear and conventional weapons, that its open military intervention would invite an extension of similar action to Communist China, and would, therefore, probably not intervene militarily.”

ASSUMPTIONS
A.	The treaties .of independence between France and the Associated States will have been signed.
B.	A regional security grouping including at least thc Associated Slates, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, France, and the United States, and possibly includ-ing also New Zealand and the United Kingdom, will have been formed.
C.	The /Associated States will have publicly requested the direct military partici-pation of members of the regional grouping in the war in Indochina.
D.	The French will have undertaken to continue at least the present level of their ■ military commitment in Indochina.
E.	The Chinese Communists will have openly intervened with military forces in Indochina in order to counter US direct participation as defined in Requirement 1.
'REQUIREMENT 3
2'o estimate Chinese Communist and Soviet reactions to an extension of allied, offensive air operations to include military targets in Communist China directly supporting Communist military operations in Indochina or directly threatening the security of Allied forces in the area."1 Nuclear weapons would be employed in these operations if it were deemed militarily advantageous to do so, but nuclear attacks on the Chinese civil population as a target system would be avoided.
Chinese Communist Reaction
10.	We consider it probable that before intervening in Indochina the Chinese Communists would have accepted the likelihood of US air attacks against military targets in China. Consequently, they would not feel compelled to withdraw their forces from Indochina solely as a result of the initiation of the air operations assumed above. At the same time, we
’In this requirement we interpret targets "directly supporting” Communist military operations to be generally south of the Yangtze River and to consist primarily of transport lines, troop con-centrations, and air fields in the area.
believe that the Chinese Communists, in order to prevent further destruction to this area of China and particularly to avoid the spread of unlimited US attacks to thc whole of China, would intensify efforts to induce the US to enter negotiations for a settlement which would preserve the Communist position and prospects in Indochina.
11.	Meanwhile the Chinese Communists, to the full extent of their capabilities, would prosecute the war on the ground in Indochina and attack allied air bases, aircraft carriers, and other installations directly supporting allied operations in the area. They would, however, probably try to keep the war cen-tered in Indochina and, as a consequcnce, probably would confine their attacks to such directly supporting bascs and installations.
12.	The use of nuclear weapons under thc restrictions given above would greatly in-crease Chinese Communist concern about US intentions but probably would not by itself cause them to adopt new courses of military action at this time. However, they would threaten nuclear retaliation. They would also exploit to the fullest resultant psycho-logical opportunities and in particular would

charge that the US was using weapons of mass destruction on the civilian population.8
13.	The Chinese Communists would attempt by all means possible to convince other Asian nations that the US had undertaken to destroy the Chinese Communist regime in order to thwart its efforts on behalf of an indigenous independence movement. If the Chi-ncsc had not previously donc so, they would probably appeal to the UN to brand US action as a threat to the peace.
Soviet Reaction -
14.	In this assumed situation, the USSR would greatly increase its military assistance to Communist China, especially supplying modern aircraft and small naval vessels, possibly including submarines, with Soviet personnel to train and advise the Chinese and probably to participate in air defense operations. The USSR would probably not openly commit combat units of thc Soviet armed forces and probably would not release nuclear weapons for Chinese Communist use.
15.	The Kremlin would also continue its diplomatic and propaganda campaigns against the
' The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, believes this paragraph should read;
“Nuclear weapon attacks on Communist China would undoubtedly result in a much greater Chinese Communist reaction than nuclear attacks on the Indochinese battleground. In addition, such attacks would probably indicate to the Chinese Communists a US willingness to exploit its superiority In nuclear weapons and delivery capability to force them out of Indochina. Since the nuclear attack contemplated in tills requirement . ls of a limited nature, the Chinese Communist rulers would retain control of the government and country and, with the Initial attacks, they would probably make urgent appeals to the USSR for nuclear weapons and additional military assistance. They might also increase the tempo of their military operations and would undoubtedly endeavor to induce the United States to enter negotiations in the hope of forestalling further attacks. A Chinese Communist decision to withdraw or not would be dependent primarily upon continued or increased US nuclear attacks and other US action as well as upon Soviet reao-tion. It is believed, however, that the Chinese Communists would bc willin" to withdraw from Indochina rather than bc su’ojeeted to further destruction of their homeland."
US, undertaking in thc UN to brand the US as an aggressor if this had not previously becn attempted. The USSR would support Chincse charges conccrning thc use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations. At the same time, the USSR would probably advise the Chinese Communists to negotiate for a cessation of hostilities on the basis of the status quo at the time and would try, to establish a position as peacemaker. •
REQUIREAAENT 4
To estimate Chinese Communist and Soviet reactions to the following additional allied courses of action, undertaken subsequently to those above:
a.	Extension of allied offensive air operations to additional selected military targets in Communist China, including the use of atomic zoeapons under the same conditions as above.
b.	Naval blockade of the China coast.
c.	Seizure or neutralization of Hainan.
d.	Chincse Nationalist operations against the Chinese mainland.	•
Chinese Communist Reaction
16.	As a consequence of this allicd broadcn-ing of the war, the Chincse Communists would probably conclude that the US was prepared to wage unlimited war against them. They would continue to defend themselves to the limit of their capabilities and would probably make vigorous efforts to sccure the full participation of thc USSR. At the same time, they would intensify their efforts to end the war by negotiations, and might eventually indicate in some way their willingness to withdraw from Indochina in order to obtain a cease-fire® If unable to obtain a cease-fire agreement, thc Chinese Communists would accept the fact of unlimited war with the US and would wage such war to the full extent of their remaining capabilities.
•The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint StalT, and the Director of Intelligence, USAF, suggest that the words “mlght eventually" in this sentence should be replaced with "would probably."	.

Soviet Reaction
17.	In this assumed situation, thc USSR would continue to provide military assistance to'Communist China as indicated above, but would probably refuse Chinese Communist demand for full Soviet participation in the war. The Kremlin would strongly urge the Chinese Communists to negotiate for a cessation of hostilities on the basis of withdrawing from Indochina.10 If thc Chinese Communists could not obtain a cease-fire agreement, thc USSR v/ould provide Communist China with military assistance in every way short of openly committing cornbat units of the Soviet armed forces in operations against US and allied forccs outside Communist-held territory. Thc USSR would provide military resources and equipment for Chinese Communist attacks on US bases or US forces anywhere in the Far East. At this stage of thc conflict, the USSR might provide Communist China with nuclear weapons and the tech-
■ nical personnel required for their use.1112
18.	Thc USSR would continue its diplomatic and propaganda campaigns against the US, insisting that the Soviet aim was purely the defense of China against outright aggression. The USSR would also begin at least partial mobilization of its own military forces on a war basis.. It would issue thinly veiled threats of general war, suggesting attacks on
Western Europe and on the contincntal US, but- would probably confinc its operations to thc defense of China so long as thc US did not attack Soviet territory.
REQUIREMENT 5
To estimate Chinese Communist and Soviet reactions to the success of the foregoing operations (i.e., to the impending effective destruction of the Chinese Communist capability to conduct military operations outside the borders of Communist China).13
Chinese Communist Reaction
19.	Unless the USSR was willing to make an unlimited commitment of Soviet forces to prevent the success of the assumed US and allied operations, we believe that the Communist Chinese, under thc assumed circumstances, would accept any US terms for a settlement which preserved the integrity of China under thc Chinese Communist regime.
Soviet Reaction
20.	In this assumed situation, we believe the USSR would urge the Chinese Communists to accept any US terms for a settlement which preserved the integrity of China under the Chinese Communist regime.” So long as the fighting continued, however, the USSR would continue its aid to China.
’’The Assistant Chief of StafI. G-2, Department of thc Army, recommends the deletion of "on the basis of withdrawing from Indochina," believing that at thls state of the conflict the Kremlin would not willingly acquiesCe in the surrender of any Communist-held territory in Indochina or elsewhere.
"The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, and Director of Intelligence, USAF, bc-lieve that this sentence should read:
“We do not believe that the USSR v/ould release nuclear weapons for Chinese Communist use.”	‘	’	•
u The Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2; Department of the Army, substitute for the last itence:
“ICis also believed that the USoR would give serious consideration to making a substantially greater military contribution Including nuclear weapons and the technical personnel required for their use.”
■'The Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Department of the Army,-believes that the results assumed in this requirement could not be achieved by the unbalanced and inSufficient force envisaged.
“ Thc Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Department of the Army, v/ould add “and retained a Communist foothold in Indochina."

From your DULTE 187 it is evident that QUOTE underground military talks UNQUOTE, even more than conference proceedings, are pointing toward de facto partition under conditions such that Communist take-over of all Vietnam looms ahead clearly.
Chauvel’s mention of difficulty of QUOTE selling UNQUOTE Vietminh proposal to Vietnamese and his doubt that Hanoi-Haiphong area can be held indicate to us that French may end by accepting any Vietminh proposition which offers hope of extricating Expeditionary Corps. In this connection we note failure of Vietminh thus far to react to French question regarding evacuation French troops and citizens and Vietnamesc Catholics.
There can of course be no repeat no question of US participation in any attempt to QUOTE sell UNQUOTE a partition to non-Communist Vietnamese. ✓ (Signed)

I saw Molotov at his villa yesterday evening at my request to inform him of my departure, and because I felt time had come to sound a note of warning. Talk lasted more than hour and a half. Molotov asked what I thought would be best thing to do with Conference, to adjourn it temporarily or to keep it going. I replied as far as we concerned should be kept going while there was hope of reaching reasonable settlement, but that there was no use referring to "committees" matters of major policy which must be decided by the Conference as a whole. Before my departure I felt it would be desirable to exchange views, in order that mistakes of the past should not be repeated as the result of misunderstanding of our respective positions. * • With regard to Korean phase, I had only to say that in reserving our position re final Chinese proposal had not implied to exclude Communist China from future discussions » on Korean question. As matter of fact, China was belligerent there against UN and for practical reasons would have to be party to settlement.

Regarding Indochinese phase Molotov said he had impression US avoided reaching solution and cited in this regard Robertson objection in yesterday’s restricted session to acceptance Chou’s proposal on Laos and Cambodia. I said that while proposal might be satisfactory in some respects it made no mention of Vietminh withdrawal or of adequate supervision. So long as regular Vietminh forces remained in Laos and Cambodia we could not help but view situation in very serious light. Molotov cited Pham Van Dong’s remarks regarding withdrawal Vietminh "volunteers" and emphasized importance of beginning direct negotiations regarding Laos and Cambodia of type now taking place regarding Vietnam. I regretted that I was not at all convinced that Pham Van Dong really meant what he said. His statements sounded well enough, but his written proposals did not bear them out.
I said I wanted to make our position on Laos and Cambodia entirely clear. In addition to regular Vietminh forces in these countries, which I enumerated, there were some dissident elements in Laos and a much smaller number in Cambodia. If regular Vietminh forces were withdrawn, elections could be held, with guarantees that individuals would be discriminated against as regards their electoral rights for having supported either side. Dissidents would

be able to vote for any candidates they chose, Communists included. However, while Vietminh forces remained in these countries, there could be no peace nor could free elections be held.
In private conversations with Mr. Eden and others, Communist delegates, in particular Chou En-lai, had taken an apparently reasonable
I	view on Laos and Cambodia, but that here again, when we came to the
point of trying to get open agreement on specific points we were unable to do so. I specifically mentioned Chou En-lai's statements to Eden in which he said that China would have no objections to recognizing the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia or to these States having forces and arms sufficient to maintain security, or their remaining in French Union so long as they were not used as military bases by the United States, we ■ could not disagree with any of this, although if we kept out the
Chinese would have to keep out, and these small states would have to be allowed to join with their neighbors in whatever regional security arrangements would best protect their integrity without constituting a threat to any one else. Chou En-lai might be anxious about possibility of US bases in Laos and Cambodia, we wanted on our part to be sure that these ■ countries were not handed over to the Chinese. Molotov said that while he did not know about what attitude Chinese might have on other questions in

future, he could asuure me that Chinese attitude on this particular questions wes not at all unreasonable, and that there was nothing in it which would give rise to conflicts. He added, however, that if we continued to take a one-sided view and insist on one-sided solutions, he must"in all frankness say that this would not succeed." There were, he said, some differences of view between us on Laos and Cambodia, especially in regard to our refusal to recognize resistance movements; point he wanted to make, however, wes that basis for reaching agreement was present and that agreement could be reached so long as neither side "adopted one-sided views or put forward extreme pretensions." This, he said, could only lead to other side's doing same.
Resistance movements existed, in Laos and Cambodia, Molotov asserted. About 50$ of the territory of Laos was not under the control of official government. It was true that much smaller resistance move-I ment existed in Cambodia. He said that in fact conditions in all three Indochinese countries were different--------large resistance move-। ment controlling three-quarters of territory in Viet Nam, substantial •-------------------------------------------------r	•

solution was simple. Withdraw invading Vietminh forces and let dissident elements elect communist representatives to general assemblies if they wished. But the elections must be actually "free". Regarding Viet Nam, I said we recognized relative strength of the Vietminh but theywere demanding too much. It seems Vietminh demanded all Delta, including both Hanoi and Haiphong. The French were our allies, and we took grave view of this extreme pressure. Molotov said that if French were to have something in Sought and something in North, and probably in center as well, this would add
• up to three-quarters of country or better, which was ••holly unreasonable. He said there was old Russian proverb that if you try to chase two rabbits at once you are apt to miss both of them, and added that in this case wanting something in North and in Sough was like chasing two rabbits. If French were to give way to Vietnimh in North, they would gain territory probably greater in extent in Sought in recompense. I said appearance of "partition" was repugnant to US, and that as ✓
far as proverb about rabbits went I felt that Vietminh were chasing two rabbits in wanting both Hanoi and Haiphong. Vietminh demands for all the Delta, or efforts take it all by force prior to reaching political solution through elections, was serious

matter in view of my Government. Molotov disagreed, stating that present French position in area was due only to Vietminh restraint, and that two cities did not even have normal communications between each other. In regard to US aversion to partition, he said that this problem could easily be solved by holding elections at once, which would decide "one way or the other." He repeated that important thing in reaching agreement on any of these questions relating Indochina was to be realistic about actual facts, and to avoid putting out one-sided views or extreme pretensions. If French were encouraged to disregard actual situation and to usk for too much, he said, one could only expect conflict to continue. (He made it clear that he
considered US as party likely to do the encouraging.) I replied that US was not one of principals to Indochinese dispute and did not cast deciding vot, to which Molotov remarked "maybe so, but you have veto, that word I hear you use so often." and went on to say that among other delegations present at Conference there seemed to be real willingness
to reach agreement. Agreement had in fact, he added, very nearly been reached, although he hoped I would realize this was not informlation for publication. (This remark, obviously, referred to private French-Vietminh military conversations which I have mentioned.) I said I must emphasize my Government held serious views on issues involved in
Indochina situation

more serious, perhaps, than did some of other governments represented at Conference. I hope he would give consideration to this, and assist in overcoming some of the deep-rooted suspicions of Asiatic participants, which became apparent .	every time we tried to reconcile formal proposals.
COI-MENT:
Throughout conversation Molotov maintained friendly and mild tone evident in all informal conversations. He is completely sure of himself and of his position. What he had to say regarding Delta, Laos and Cambodia confirms Communist intentions to play all the cards they hold. His avoidance of endorsing Chou’s remarks to Eden concerning Laos and Cambodia indicated that simple withdrawal of Vietminh forces from these countries was not acceptable and that some form of de facto partition was intended in Laos, at least. His remarks seemed to indicate that Communists have eye on as much as half of country. This conversation, together with the inflexible position which Molotov took during his last conversation with me regarding the composition of a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for Indochina, as well as his speech on Tuesday, June 8, and all subsequent speeches on the Communist side, which took firm positions on points the Communists know to be

t unacceptable to Eden, Bidault and me, are highly significant. The recent emphasis by all three Communist spokesmen that France should carry on direct political as i well as direct military negotiations with Vietminh show their interest in having a convenient way of holding out for greater gains in their direct negotiations with the French as well as within the framework of the Conference.
Molotov in effect told France in his June 8 speech that her position and that of the Government she was supporting in Indochina were hopeless and that she had best face up to facts and capitulate in direct negotiations with the Vietminh. His ' -speech, of course, was in large part intended to assist in the destruction of the French Government for the implications that that would have on the European as well as the Asiatic scene. Nevertheless, his harsh and even insulting language seemed to reflect the confident, nearly triumphant mood in which he has been lately. It would be misleading to ascribe the harder line which Molotov brought back with him from Moscow entirely to Soviet tactical considerations in regard
*r I to the French Government crisis, while the Soviets may think that the blocking of EDC through the destruction of the French Government would reduce future threats to them in Europe, the fact remains that the Indochina conflict
potentially involves a much more immediate threat

It is probable that initial Soviet tactics were to forestall US intervention in the Delta by some kind of a compromise formula involving Hanoi and Haiphong if it appeared that such intervention were imminent. The recent raising of the ante in the negotiations here by the Communist side probably reflects an estimate on their part that our intervention is improbable and that they are safe to go ahead there, keeping, of course, a sharp eye out for indications of change in our attitude.
while the Communist position on Laos and Cambodia .
remains more flexible than their position in regard to the Delta, they trill get all they can in Laos now. In the whole are the determing factor for the Communists will continue to be their estimate of the likelihood of US or joint intervention and nothing short of a conviction on their part that this intervention will take place will stop them from going ahead with their plans for taking all of it eventually, through military conquest, French capitulation, or infiltration.
Realize much of above is repetitious, but it will I i

is concluded, dangerous reactions by the Vietnamese Government whose citizens are serving at the present time under the orders of the French command, comprising a major proportion thereof.
’’The French Prime Minister feels that the allied American and British
governments should be as well informed as possible of these possibilities.
M. Mendes-France wishes especially to call the attention of these taro Governments to the following aspects of the situation:
”(1) If the Viet Minh appears disposed to negotiate, it is for a scries of ,
reasons among which figure without doubt the fear of a spreading of the conflict,
a spreading which nothing at the present time would lead us to expect, but which
the general world situation does not permit us to exclude. Although the fear of such an extension of the conflict may have a determining influence on the decisions of our adversaries, the French Government realises that precise declarations on this subject are not possible at this time. But it considers it would be very useful if the final communique of the Anglo-American talks in Washington could state in some fashion or other that, if it is not possible to reach a reasonable settlement at the Geneva Conference, a serious aggra- .tion
, of international relations would result.	•
•'(2) The problem which is posed with regard to Vietnam is different. It is to be feared that any solution providing for an indefinite period a division of the country will cause a violent and unreasoning reaction on the part of the Vietnamese patriots. While this Ioaction may be in a large measure inevitable, every effort should nevertheless be made to canalise this reaction in a direction

"To this end it appears highly desirable to the Prine Minister of France to • obtain the assurance of the United States Government that nothing will be done by the latter which might even implicitly encourage such a reaction. Under present circumstances such action could lead to no result but to ruin any hope of seeing Vietnam consolidate herself in such a fashion as to create in the face of the Viet Minh an authentically national and independent force. It is for this reason that the French Government strongly hopes it can count on the ■ United States at the propcr moment to intervene with the Vietnamese to counsel upon them wisdom and self-control and to dissuade them from refusing an agreement which, if it is reached, is dictated not by the spirit of abandoning them, but on the contraiy by the desire to save in Indochina all that can possibly be saved, and to give the Vietnamese state, under peaceful conditions, opportunities which have not always been possible heretofore because of the war."

Re DEPTELs 5 and 8.

I took up reference telegrams with Mendes this afternOOn. Regarding present withdrawals in the delta Mendes said that these had been planned in May by the Laniel gOVernment and he had made no change in tne original plan. The withdrawals represent a definite shOrtening of the French lines tO prOtect HanOl, Haiphong and the COnnecting read.
He said he had been much surprised tO read in the papers that a State Department spOlesman had said that the US had net had prior information regarding these withdrawals. He had assumed, he said, that Ely had fully infermed O’Daniel Of his plans. He then accOrdingly asked Ely this tnOrning if that was nOt the case and Ely had tOlci him that he had not infOrmed O’Daniel. Mende.s accOrdingly Offered his apclOgies and said that he had ins true ted EU—in the _f u ture tO keep 0’Daniel_ fully .infOrmed On the spOt.

Regarding withdrawals themselVes he said they were necessary tc ensure the safety Of the French Expeditionary COrps.

Regarding the right Of population transfer as cOntained in . paragraph 6 of DEPTEL 4853, Mendes said that he Was thOrOughly in accOrd that this Wculd be a gcod thing f om the French point Of View. He said that it had been mentiOned tO the Viet Minh in GeneVa and that they had made nc ansver either faVOrable or u'nf aVorable. When I reiterated the importance that v/e attach tO th— ; subject, Mendes made a nets of it and said that he wa.s writing Chauvet tonight and Would include in his letter Of instructiOn a reference tO this subject.
I think it Would be useful if Johnsen Would stress this subject in his next talk With Chauvel.
Mendes then said negOtiatiOns in GeneVa had been at a standstill and that he had instructed ChauVel tO go to Berne fcr twe days tO show that the French Were in DO greater hurry than the Viet Minh. He said that the SoViet representatiVe at GeneVa had tcld Chauvel not tO WOrry about the slow pace of the negotiations as at cOnferences such as these eVerything was alvays settled in last few hOurs.
Regarding DEPTEL 8, use Of WOrd ’’Withdrawal" Was intended only tO <he_an deployment into agreed ' regroupmen t’> areas ✓" Mendes sale "that the ■'French—On timing ” Of ’ el ection areTiOldihg out for 18LJ2iQQ±hs_ja£i^:^	regrouping Which, he said,

He then COtntnented that Diem had made an unhelpful Sneeeh t'-^ other day in SaigOn When he Was gupted as~hayingZsaid that he—wals in Payor of the elections vithi n a year.

Deng stated that he WOuld cOnsider this further. He is aware that French, British and SOViet delegatiOns are working on specific prOpcsals (SECTO 555).
ChauVel repOrts that he spOke most firmly tO Deng regarding military discussions. He Said French have accepted Viet Minh proposal that Viet Minh receiVe TOrikin area, including C apital, but that further Viet Minh prcpOsal fOr demarcatiOn line is unacceptable. ChauVel reiterated in strengest terms fact that French p'rOpcsal fOr demarcaticn line just ncrth’Of Dong HOi . WOuld be acceptable tO ccnference and WOuld thus eliminate danger

In gOlng Over file since drafting EMBTEL 75 we have determined, that Dsparttnent as Well as DefenSe Were informed Of French plans tO WithdraW to inner perimeter Of TOnkln delta On May 50.

THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
WASHINGTON
JUL 9 1954
Dear Mr. Murphy:
I refer to my letter of June 19th regarding U. S. assistance to the French in the formation and equipping of three light infantry divisions for use in Indo-China. The evaluation referred to in that letter has been prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as set forth in the attached memorandum, with which I concur.
Since no additional indication of French intentions has been received in the Department of Defense and the new Premier has promised to end the war in Indo-China by 20 July or resign, I shall leave to you the timing of any additional U. S. actions which may be desired. I desire to point out, however, that in the event a formal request is received there is, in addition to the points contained in the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorandum, the additional problem raised by Section 1O6a(1) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 (Richards Amendment), as approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which could bar the United States from replacing this equipment.
In the event that you determine that this French plan is worthy of further action, I suggest that the above point be included in those requiring resolution since the impact on NATO of the removal of equipment, if permanent, would be considerable.
Sincerely yours
.	(Signed)

During the talks of Prime Minister Churchill and
Foreign Secretary Eden with President Eisenhower and me, • .
an effort was made to find a common position which might t be acceptable to the two of us and, we hoped, to the French GoVernment. This was expressed in the seven-point memorandum
r
.of which you are aware. I believe that this represented a constructive contribution. However, I do not yet feel that there is a united position in thc sense that the three of us would be prepared to stand firmly on this as a minimum
• . accentable solution and to 3ee the negotiations break off
and the warfare resume if this position was not accepted
by the Communist side. ;7e doubt very much that the Commu-
nists will in fact accept this seven-point position unless
they realize that the alternative is some common action upon
which we have all agreed. So far, there is no such alternative
Under these circumstances, we greatly fear that the seven points which constitute a minimum as far as the US is concerned will constitute merely an optimum solution so far
as your Government and perhaps the UK are concerned, and that an armistice might be concluded on terms substantially less favorable than those we could respect.
V/e gather that there is already considerable French thinking in terms of the acceptability of departures from
certain of the seven points. For example:

Point United States-United Kingdom position and he did not (repeat not) make any commitment to hold to these points during coming week, except for statement regarding United States veto power if Secretary present.
( .
On the overall effect of our decision, Mendes pointed out that this will be first time since the war that United States not.(repeat not) represented at equal level with other powers in an important conference. He said he felt certain that Europe would interpret United States absence as first ’ step in return to a policy of isolationism. This he felt, would have catastrophic effects not (repeat not) only in Far East, but also in Europe and would be great cold war victory for Communism. According to Mendes, we would in effect be saying "do your best,_you have our sympathy, but result is no (repeat no) real concern to us."
I tried hard to dissuade Mendes from this viewpoint, but without much success. His statement regarding United States veto power if Secretary present, led me to point out that there must also be an agreed alternative if Conference failed. Mendes promptly replied that only alternative to cease-fire at Geneva would be internationalization of war with United States military forces coming promptly to assistance of French. This aspect of our talk being covered more fully in separate telegram, being repeated to Saigon.
Finally, Mendes asked if there was anything he could do specifically to create a situation that would make it possible for Secretary to come to Geneva. He asked me to pass this question on to Washington. In this connection, he specifically questioned sixth paragraph of Secretary's letter, and said he knew of no (repeat no) French thinking along such lines, except possibly on subject of international supervision. He wondered where United States had got the ideas expressed in this paragraph.
While I was talking with Mendes, Johnson talked with Chauvel and showed him a copy of Secretary's letter. Chauvel showed Johnson a cable from Bonnet which indicated that Bonnet may have given Secretary the impression that French were considering retrating from Seven Point program.
•	Chauvel and Johnson joined us at end of our talk, and Johnson and I suggested that if Mendes developed any concrete ideas which would help meet United States fears, it would be helpful if he put them into a reply to Secretary’s letter. While Mendes was non-conmital as to a formal reply, I rather expect he will make one. In closing, Mendes said he would keep
•	in close touch with Johnson. During talk, Mendes made it clear that while
presence of Under Secretary at Geneva would be most helpful, he very much hoped that Secretary himself could come.	.

of tho U.K. area may be
with respect to collective security in the summarized as follows:
view that a collective security arrangement
for Southeast Asia should be considered in two contexts, (1) on the basis of a settlement in Indochina, and (2) on tho basis of no settlement. In tho event of a settlement which doos not pose an immediate military problem, the British would prefer a generalized collective security arrangement designed to bring in as many statcs as possible. This approach v/suld includo such states as India, Indonesia, and Burna. On the other hand, if thcro is no Indochina settlement at Geneva the British would agreo to immediately establish cn organization to moot the military throat. Such an organization would pro-sumably bo limited to those countries who would make military commitments to halt tile Communist argrossion.

Ini
r.'c
b. Under the arrangement which the British prefer be established in tho event of a settlement, there would be throe principal elements to the organization: a council which would include all participants in the organization, an economic and political council which would includo as many of the States as possible and would deal with the economic and social problems of tho area, and a military organization which would have fewer members, since states such cs India would unquestionably not vi sh to participate in the military aspects of tho organization.	.
c. In thc evcnt that taere is no agreement in Indochina, the British would immeaia oly move ahead with an offoctivs military arrange-
merit dosignod to obtain as much
iblo for an
organisation
to resist further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia.

In addition to trie foregoing, there are Soveral points which have come out in discussions with tho British which are worthy of mention:
a.	The British h'.- e no intention of "pressing forward" with a Southobst .Asia Collective Security Organization until thc Indochina phase of the lencva Conference has been terminated.
b.	Tho British representative has referred on a number of occa-cions-to use of military force to repel overt Communist aggression. ’ ■ However, the British attitude with respect to infiltration and subversion is vaguo.
c.	Tho British consider that the principal problem in dcaling with Southeast ASia after an Indochina settlement would be a large-scalo economic assistance program. Although there has boon no discussion as to support of the economic assistance program for Southeast Asia, tiiero is little doubt which stato would bo tho principal contributor.
.	During the course of the meetings, General Smith has maintained
that regardless or whether there is a settlement in Indochina it is necessary that an effective collective security organization bo estab-_ liShed. Further, it is necessary that the organization be established immediately in order that we will be in a pocition to deal with the
• probable adverse political and military repercussions in the Associated . States that will result from an unsatisfactory settlement of the Indochina conflict. It has also boon pointed out to the British that inasmuch as tho principal danger of further Communist aggression in Southeast Asia will probably-take the form of infiltration and subversion, tho organization must be in a position to deal effectively with this situation.
Sinco approval of a colloctive security organization would probably require considerable time for action by tho various governments concerned, tho United States representatives have proposed that consideration bo given to the establishment of an interim organization to deal with the situation. The British have indicated tentative agreement v/ith this idea. A further point has been made by the U. S. representatives that no geographical limitation should be put on the treaty covering the collective security area, I re commended., and Secretary Dulles agreod, that the area covered by tho treaty should not be restricted to Southeast Asia but rather should be open to permit inclusion of non-Communist states of .	the entiro Fur East area. Although Sir Robert Scott did not object to
•	, this view, it is possible that when tho formal British position becomes clear they might not agree to leave open tho area to bo covered by the Treaty.
An additional point which has boon discussed with tho BritiSh has
•	been the question of a declaration to be made in tho avont of a settlo-mont at Geneva on Indochina. Secretary Smith informed the British that tho U.S. is planning to make a unilateral declaration and hopes that .

declarations which the Pritioh and other- allies make would not vary substantially from the U.S. declaration. Sir Robert Scott indicated that the British prefer a multilateral deelnr- tion to include at least Australia, .'ow Zealand, and possibly India and other nations having an interest in tho area. The British do not exclude thc possibility of a multilateral dcclnr tion including Communist pnrti.cipf.tion. Tho British were informed thrt it would bo impossible for the United States to participate in a multilatoral declaration which includes Communist China.
Several documents have bean exchanged by the U.S. and U.K. dolega-tions. At a meeting on 10 July a U.S. draft treaty was submitted to the British for their consideration. British comments are expected at a meeting on 13 July. Folloiyimr receipt of the British comments, it is planned that tin draft treaty v.'ill be Submitted to thc Joint Chiefs of Staff for consideration. If thc viows of the U.S. and U.K. on a draft treaty can bo resolved, tho Department of State plans to establish, a working group consisting of tho U.S., U.K., and other countries which are likcly to participate in a collective security organization, v/ith a
view to developing an agreed draft of a treaty. I shall kcop you informed of further dcvelopmonts in this matter.

SECRETARY DULLES« SSFORT ON HIS RECEHT TRIP TO PARIS
, At the NSC meeting of 19 July, Secretary Dulles reported on his recent trip to Paris as follows:
।	1. He had been in practically continuous meetings with kendes-
• France and lir. Eden from the tine of his arrival to his departure, .- : sometimes with one or the other individually and sometimes with tj'.c two together. He had told Mendes that, in his opinion, most of • France’s troubles stem from a lack of French decision on EDC. Because of this, the Soviets were being successful in splitting France and Germany. Therefore, he out the greatest urgency on French action'on EEC. Mendes said that it might not be possible now to
.	• get a constitutional majority of 3lf votes in the Assemble without
some face-saving formula. He hoped this could be done through minor amendments ’which would not require renegotiation, but in any .	• event, Hend.es had promised Secretary Dulles action by the /assembly
.	by early August. Nr. Dulles had pointed out that the U.S. public
;	was getting a trifle short-tempered on the EDC topic and that if
. . j	Mendes was not careful, the U.S. Congress might terminate aid to
NATO Which would be detrimental to the military effort of all Europe, especially France.
•	2. a. Regarding the dilemma of U.S. participation in the
Geneva Conference, Secretary Dulles had pointed out that if the U.S. participates in the Conference and then finds itself unable to guarantee the results, a violent French public reaption against the U.S. would ensue. Similarly, if the U.S. participates and so stiffens French will that France does not accept the Communist best offer, then again, the U.S. would be blamed and a major strain placed upon U.S.-French relations. Therefore, the U.S. was seeking to play an inconspicuous role.
b. The original VN proposal had been for a partition line along the lfth parallel: their second proposal, along the 16th parallel. Both had been rejected and the French position was to hold out for the l8th parallel, along with the guaranteed independence of Laos and Cambodia.	•
c.' The Secretary had worked up with the French a joint U.S.-French paper along the lines of the seven points of the
• U.S.-U.K. eater which had resulted from the Churchill-Eden — - _
talks. Nr. Dulles had said there would be no U.S. guarantee of the settlement, but rather a unilateral declaration that ■	the U.S. would not attempt to change it by force. Mendes had
provided Mr. Dulles with a letter of reply and acceptance of - Vrzz-t	the U.S.-French position paper. Accordingly, Gen. Smith was
returning to Geneva with his instructions contained in these

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
3.	Mr. Dulles said that the Mendes Government put more emphasis on the granting of independence to the Associated States then had the Laniel Government. Mendes even agreed that French f unctionyires ,and eventually armed forces would have to leave the area. It was current French planning to hold Haiphong until French forces and ■ their equipment could be evacuated but not to attempt to maintain i Haiphong as a permanent enclave. • _ *
4.	When asked if the VN Would agree to the seven points, the. Secretary said he was not sure but he could count on support from Laos and Cambodia. Er. Allen Dulles felt the possibility of MJ uprising against the French was a real one.
9. Mendes had assured Secretary Dulles that if the Geneva Conference was a failure, he would send two additional French divisions to Indochina, although they could not arrive before September, 1994-

Chauvel said French were concerned over reports continued contacts between Fran Van Do and Dong. They did not know exactly what was happening, they know very little about Do, but they had impression he was unsophisticated and might be "taken into camp" by Dong. They felt after zones between defined and two governments each clearly responsible for own territories, such contacts would probably be desirable and necessary, but in present situation might be dangerous and could even result in surprise more bringing about something in nature of coalition government. Chauvel said De Jean was going to see Bao Dai to determine what Bao Dai knew about the matter and whether he had approved.
In reply to my question on what French conceived to be major outstanding issue, Chauvel listed: (1) military demarcation line in Vietnam, (2) regrouping in Vietnam, particularly in delta area, where Chauvel said Viet Minh would be required to move out two divisions from areas that they now occupied so as permit separation from French-Vietnamese forces. In Laos he said major question retention small number French troops there (consideration was being given to "changing their flag" from French to Laos), . and also political questions in Laos. He said there were no major issues on Cambodia.
Chauvel also mentioned international control and asked whether I had any new instructions on subject. I said I had not and subject had not been discussed at Paris in any detail.
UK informed me today that meeting was proposed this afternoon between Mendes, Eden and Molotov to go over present stage of work of conference and make catalogue of work to be done. They asked whether I wished to be present, pointing out if US were present Soviets would probably insist on presence of Chinese, thus turning meeting into "five power affair". I replied that I had no objection to their goind ahead on three-power basis.

On the other hand the regroupment of non-national armed forces in the zones resulting from the partition implies their con-solidation outside of any danger of combat and thus reinforces the threat that they constitute to the free expression of the will of the people.
I
Therefore not only does such a cease-fire not lead to a durable peace, since, ignoring the will for national unity, it provokes the people to "unify" the country, but, by the consolidation of the armed forces now facing each other, it violates in advance the liberty of the future elections.
The delegation of the State of Vietnam, which more that any other wishes the return of peace, is pleased with the efforts put forth by the other delegations in favor of this object. However, it greatly fears that the cease-fire, such as it seems to be accepted by certain delegations, far from leading to peace, makes peace improbable and precarious.
Aware of these very grave dangers and certain that it is expres-sing the profound aspirations of all true Vietnamese, including most of the Viet Minh fighters themselves, and in full accord with the Chief and the Government of the State of Vietnam, the Vietnamese delegation asks not only a cease-fire but the disarmament of all the belligerent forces in Vietnam.
The Vietnamese delegation asks that the entire territory of Vietnam be placed provisionally under the control of the United Nations pending the complete re-establishment of security, of order and of peace in their minds and in their hearts which will permit the Vietnamese people to decide their destiny by free elections.
His Majesty Bao Dai, Chief of State of Vietnam, thus shows once more that he places the independence and the unity of his country above any other consideration, and the National Govern-ment of Vietnam would prefer this provisional control by the United Nations over a truly unified and independent Vietnam to its maintenance in power in a country dismembered and condemned to slavery.
The Vietnamese delegation reserves its right to develop its proposal at a later time.

The infOrmant, vzhO reflects the Views Of Red China Premier Chou En-lai, said the Communists are hOpeful Of a cease-fire agreement by next Tuesday’s deadline if the Western pOwers agree tO 'bar all fOreign military bases frOtn Indochina and keep the three member states Out Of any military blcc.1

The Communist informant said the 'crucial issue' new in the Geneva neace negOtiatiOns reVOlves arOund Whether the Western pOwers will agree effecti-Vely tO neutralize IndOchina.
'Refusal tO jOin in such a guarantee,' the'infOrmant said, .
'COuld sericusly deter a final settlement. On Other impOrtant pOints in the negOtiatiOns We are in agreement Or clOse tO it. We are hopeful and ve belieV© that there is time tO reach a settlement by July 20.’
, French Premier Pierre Mendes-France has promised tO resign With ihis Cabinet if he fails to end the blOody eight-year-Old War
by next Tuesday. Fall Of the French GOVernment prObably WOuld dOOtn the GeneVa negOtiatiOns. The infOrmant declared that American efferts to Organize a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) is 'a threat to any pOssible Indochina agreement.'
’Success Or failure Of the GeneVa Conference may depend On, the attitude Of the American delegatiOn in this regard,' he added.

The above seems tO me extremely significant, particularly in view Of the fact that in my discussion with Eden last night he expressed pessimism, Which he said was nOw shared fcr the first time by Krishna Menon. Latter had begun to feel, as I do, that MOlOtOV Wishes tO fOrce Mendes-France’s resignatiOn. Eden~ remarked that MolQicLV__b.ad_notr-hennme._tha_mOs.t_ri 1 ff i cult, and intransigent"member of COtW-misi-delegaiiou. Yen will note ObVlous mtentiOn tO place On shOulders Of US respOnsibility for failure Of Geneva COnference and fall Of French IjOVernment if this Occurs.
MOlOtoy is insisting On a meeting this afternocn which French, and British are trying tO make highly restricted as they are apprehensiVe Of What, may Occur. If such a meeting is held and if’demands are made for US associatiOn in any agreement, I will simply say that in the eVent a reascnable settlement is arriVed at which US could ’’respect", US Will probably issue a unilateral statement Ofits own positiOn. If question Of participation Lacs, Cambodia and Vietnam in security pact is raised,'I Will reply that this depends On OutcOine Of COnference.

Do noted further that there was no mention of State of Vietnam in either French or Soviet drafts. Vietnamese delegation cannot aCcept declaration or agreement where Vietnam, which invited to conference as existing state, not even mentioned.
After pause following Molotov’s request for other speakers, General made following statement:
"If no one else desires to speak, I think it would be helpful if I made clear position of US in these last critical days of conference. I do this because I have recently seen the advance drafts submitted to the conference and have had a chance to review them.
"One position of the United States with respect to this conference has consistently been that it is willing to assist, where desired, in arriving at a just and honorable settlement which will contribute to the establishment and maintenance of peace in the area. The United States is not a belligerent in this conflict and it has not and will not seek to impose its views in any way upon the belligerents, who are the parties primarily interested.
"If the agreements arrived at here are of a character which my government is able to respect, the United States is prepared to declare unilaterally that, in accordance with its obligations under the United Nations Charter, and particularly Article 11(4), it will refrain from the threat or the use of force to disturb them, and would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the agreements with grave concern.
Since no other representatives requested floor following General Smith's statement, Molotov suggested intermission. After intermission had lasted for 45 minutes, it was informally agreed that meeting should be adjourned without returning to conference room. No communique issued.
Comment: Today’s restricted session strangest performance to date.
Apparent Molotov had not set stage even with Communist colleagues	•
for any particularly important announcement despite his insistence that meeting be called. Molotov had said to Mendes-France just before meeting that he thought would be well underline progress made and to show how close conference was to reaching agreement.
During recess, Chou En-lai said he had no desire make any statement. He seemed as much in dark as everyone else as to why Soviets had called meeting.

(This •unilateral declaration l>y the United States Government sets forth its position with regard to the Geneva Accords, which it did not sign.)	■	•
STATEMENT BY THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE1 AT THE CONCLUDING PLENARY SESSION OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE, JULY 21, 19542
As I stated on July 18, my Government is not prepared to join in a declaration by tho Conference such as is submitted However, the United States makes this unilateral declaration of its position in these _ mattera:	•	•
Declaration	•
Tho Government of the United States being resolved to devote its efforts to the. strengthening of peace in accordance with the principles and purposes of tho United Nations takes noto of the agreements concluded at Geneva on July 20 and 21, 1954 between (a) tho Franco-Laotian Command and tho Command of tho Peoples Anny of Vict-- Nam; (b) tho Royal Khmer Anny Command and the Command of ■ ■■ tho Peoples Army of Viet-Nam; (c) Franco-Vietnamese Command . and the Command of the Peoples Army of Viet-Nam and of para-i . grapliS 1 to 12 inclusive of tho declaration presented to the Geneva.
'. Conference on July 21, 1951 declares with regard to the aforesaid - agreements and paragraphs that (i) it will refrain from the threat or . tho uso of force to disturb them, in accordance with Article 2(4) of tho
Charter of the United Nations dealing with the obligation of members • . to refrain in their international relations from the threat, or use of forcejand (ii) it would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of tho aforesaid agreements with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security.
In Connection with tho statement in tho declaration concerning freo elections in Viet-Nam. my Government wishes to mako clear its position which it has expressed in a declaration made in Washington on J uno 29,1954, aS follows:
In the ease of nations now divided against their will, we shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by tho Untted Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly.	.
With respect to the statement made by the representative of tho State of V iet-Nam, the United States reiterates its traditional position that peopics are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join in an arrangement which would hinder this. Nothing in its declaration just made 1s intended to or does indicate any do' parture from this traditional position.
■We share the hope that tho agreements will permit Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam toplay their part, in full indcpohdence and sovereignty. • in the peaceful community of nations, and will enable ths peoples of that area to determine their own future. .	......	.
