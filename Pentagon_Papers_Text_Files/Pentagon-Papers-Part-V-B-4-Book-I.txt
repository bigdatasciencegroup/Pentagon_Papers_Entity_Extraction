U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR -- INTERNAL D0CUMEHTS ------------—--------------------------------------
• The Kennedy Administration: January 1961 - November 1963
Foreword
This volume contains a collection of internal U.S. Government documents and position papers regarding U.S. policy toward Vietnam. The volume of materials for this period is so large as to preclude the inclusion in such a collection of more than a sample of the documents in the files. Those classified materials that are included, however, were circulated at the highest levels of the Government and either bore directly on the process of policy formation or were decision-making instruments. The collection is organized chronologically and devoted exclusively to the Kennedy years. A separate volume covers the Johnson Administration.

U.S. INVOLVEFIENT IN THE WAR — INTERNAL DOCUMENTS
The Kennedy Administration: January 1961 - November 1963
Contents and
Chronological List of Documents
1961	Page
1.	General Lansdale reports on his January visit to Vietnam:
"The U.S. should recognize that Vietnam is in a critical condition and should treat it as a combat area of the cold war..." He recommends strong support for Diem personally as the best available South Vietnamese leader, and the prompt transfer of Ambassador Durbrow, whose relations with Diem are poor. Memo for Secretary of Defense, 17 January 1961........................................................... 1
2.	Embassy Saigon is advised that Kennedy has approved CounterInsurgency Plan (prepared by previous Administration) calling for increases in U.S. support for Vietnamese armed forces, contingent on reforms by Diem. State to Saigon 1054, 3 February 1961.............................................. 14
3.	The President requests the SecDef to examine means for placing more emphasis on the development of counter guerrilla forces. NSAM 2, 3 February 1961.............................. 17
4.	The Secretary of Defense is instructed to report his views on actions in the near future to launch guerrilla operations in Viet Minh territory. NSAM 28, 9 March 1961................ 18
5.	The JCS comment on the recommendations of Lt Gen Trapnell.
In addition to the Trapnell recommendations, the J.CS suggest that the U.S. provide Defense support funds on the same basis for 170,000 forces as for 150,000; that the U.S. provide MAP support for the entire 68,OOO-man Civil Guard; and that the U.S. exploit these contributions to induce the GVK to accept the Counter Insurgency Plan. Memorandum reflects conflict of views between MAAG and Embassy in Saigon.

6.	Unsigned paper, apparently by Lansdale, proposes a Presidential directive organizing a Task Force to come up with an approved plan of action in Vietnam. The goals of U.S. policy in Vietnam fall into three interrelated parts: (1) pacification, (2) stabilization and (3) unification of Vietnam under anti-communist government. Tasks are outlined in this memorandum to accomplish these three goals. Paper in Deputy Secretary of Defense Task Force file, 19 April 1961.................. 22
7.	General Lansdale provides a detailed description of President Diem and his family apparently intended for Vice President Johnson’s use. Lansdale first met Diem in Saigon in 1954. "Here is our toughest ally...a 6O-year old bachelor who gave up romance with his childhood sweetheart... to devote his life to his country." Lansdale Memorandum for Deputy Secretary of Defense, 25 April 1961........................... 36
8.	In view of the serious military deterioration within South Vietnam and in order to accomplish the U.S. objective of preventing communist domination of the South, this first draft of the Vietnam Task Force report calls for a comprehensive political, economic and military program of U.S. support. Among other recommendations are an increase in MAAG and MAP and a visit by the Vice President in the near future. Task Force Draft "Program of Action," 26 April 1961................................................................. 42
9,	The effect of a political settlement in Laos would be (1) to inhibit U.S. assistance in preventing a communist take-over in SVN; and (2) to permit an expansion of the VC effort in SVN owing to the greater possibilities for uninhibited infiltration; and (3) give complete control to the North Vietnamese of the three passes through the Annamite Mountains. With an expanded training program in SVN, however, the GVN should be able to defend itself even in the event of a Laotian settlement. Second Draft "Laos Annex" to Task Force report, 28 April 1961.......................................... 58
10.	Attorney General Kennedy asks the question "Where would be the best place to stand and fight in SEA — where to draw the line?" Secretary McNamara thinks the best place to take a stand is in Thailand and SVN. General Decker thinks there is no good place to fight in SEA. State Department Memorandum of Conversation, 29 April 1961....................................... 62
1— Secretary Rusk decides at this meeting at the State Depart-ment that "We should not place combat forces in SVN at this time." Colonel Robert M. Levy Memorandum for Record, 5 May 1961................................................................. 67

12.	Final Draft of the Task Force Report recommends sending U.S. Battle Groups and an Engineer Battalion for training purposes; the assignment of coastal patrol missions to CUiCPACFLT; and the air surveillance and close-support role to CINCPACAF. It also recommends the Vice-Presi-dential trip, a letter to Diem from Kennedy, increased MAP and other assistance, and a general U.S. commitment to support of Diem. Final Draft Task Force Report "A Program of Action," 6 May 1961..........................................
13.	OSD requests the JCS to review and study the military advisability of possible commitment of U.S. forces to SVN. Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum for Chairman, JCS, 8 May 1961.....................................................
14.	President Kennedy provides Vice President Johnson with a personal letter to present to President Diem. Kennedy sug-gests that, in addition to actions in the Counter-Insur-gency Plan, the U.S. is prepared to: (1) augment the personnel of MAAG, (2) expand MAAG's duties, (3) provide MAP support for the Civil Guard, and (4) provide support for the Vietnamese Junk Force. President Kennedy letter to President Diem, 8 May 1961...................................
15.	The President makes the following decisions: (1) the U.S. objective is to prevent communist domination of SVN and to create in that country a viable and increasingly democratic society, (2) the President directs full examination of the size and composition of forces which would be desirable in the case of a possible commitment of U.S. forces to Viet-nam, (3) finally, the President approves continuation of the special Task Force on Vietnam. The decisions of this NSAM are based on the report "A Program of Action to Pre-vent Communist Domination of SVN." NSAM 52, 11 May 1961...
16.	President Diem asserts that the recent developments in Laos emphasize the grave Vietnamese concern for the security of their country with its long end vulnerable frontiers. President Diem states that "as a small nation we cannot hope to meet all of our defense needs alone..." and expresses confidence that the Vietnamese needs will be given consider-ation in Washington. President Diem letter to President Kennedy, 15 May 1961.............................................
17.	Lansdale summarizes information on the possible deployment of U.S. combat forces in VN. He refers to a conversation between Diem and Vice President Johnson on the subject.

"Much of the thinking has been on stationing U.S. combat forces in the high plateau...however, General Williams has written a brief memorandum to me recommending such U.S. forces to be stationed on the coast..." Lansdale Memorandum for Deputy Secretary Gilpatric, 18 May 1961......... 157
18.	The Vice President reports on his mission to SEA. Johnson feels, on the basis of his visit, that the situation in Laos has created doubt and concern about U.S. intentions throughout all of SEA. "No amount of success at Geneva can, of
• itself, erase this." It is Johnson’s impression that his	-
mission arrested the decline of confidence in the U.S. "We didn’t buy time -- we were given it. If these men I saw at your request were bankers, I would know — without bothering to ask — that there would be no further exten-	.
sions of my note." The fundamental decision required of the U.S. is whether we are to attempt a major effort in support of the forces of freedom in the area or "throw in the towel." Johnson recommends "we proceed with a clearcut and strong program of action." Vice President Johnson 159 Memorandum to President Kennedy, 23 May 1961................
19.	President Diem sends the U.S. a study on Vietnamese needs to meet the insurgency situation in the South. Diem suggests that, in light of the current situation, an additional 100,000 men above the new force level of 170,000 will be required to counter the threat of communist domination. Diem recommends a considerable expansion of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in SVN as an essential requirement, and, finally, Diem expresses his mistrust of Sihanouk’s communist sympathies and antagonism of SVN. President Diem letter to President Kennedy, 9’ June 1961............ 167
20.	President Kennedy requests that the Secretary of Defense estimate requirements and make recommendations with respect to the anticipated future U.S. needs in the field of unconventional warfare and paramilitary operations. NSAM 56, 28 June 1961........................................................ 174
21.	Lansdale relates a conversation between Vice President Tho and Colonel Black. In discussing the Staley Mission, Tho concedes that it is impossible for the U.S. to provide SVN with piastres. The GVN feels an increase in piastre return per dollar would cause inflation and, in turn, an inevitable demand for wage increases. Tho further concedes that the basic problem in VN is more political than economic. Tho's impression of the current situation in SVC is more pessimistic

than that of the Americans. Lansdale Memorandum for Deputy Secretary Gilpatric, 12 July 1961....................
22. Mr. william P. Bundy forwards the joint action program proposed by the GVN-US Special Financial Group to the Assistant Secretary of Defense. The report prepared by . Dr. Eugene Staley, Chairman of the Group, has been submit-ted to President Ngo Diem and President John F. Kennedy, and includes the fiscal and economic implications of increasing the Vietnamese armed forces to 200,000 strength. The military portions, in addition to the requirements already planned, would require approximately $42 million, during the 18-month period, July 61-December 62. Bundy Memorandum to Gilpatric, 25 July 1961, (Staley Report attached)..........................................................
■ 23. General Lionel C. McCarr, Chief, MAAG-Vietnam, reviews the military situation and offers recommendations for continued improvement of the situation in SVN to President Dicm. Among the recommendations made by McGarr are: (1) that a national internal security council be established to prepare and execute the Vietnamese National Counter Insurgency Plan; (2) that effective border and coastal surveillance capabilities be initiated; (3) that U.S. advisers be more effectively utilized by accompanying ARVN units on combat operations; and (4) finally, that the reorganization of the military command structure and establishment of a single chain of command be implemented as recommended in the Counter Insurgency Plan. Aide-Memoire for President Diem, received Secretary of Defense, 2 August 196]......................
24.	The JCS do not believe that an alternate force of 270,000 would be required to enable the RVNAF to conduct counterinsurgency operations and, concurrently, be prepared to meet overt aggression. They recommend that the strategic force objectives for VN remain at the 9 division level (200,000) subject to further assessment. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 518-61, 3 August 1961.................
25.	The President approves the Staley recommendations and decides that the U.S. will provide equipment and training assistance for an increased RVNAF from 170,000 to 200,000. It is hoped that President Diem will get the maximum mileage in terms of internal political support from this new commitment, and that he will involve more elements of the non-communist political opposition in the civic action program.

26.	The situation in North and South VN is analyzed and the scope of the communist threat to SVN is estimated for the following year. The analysis concludes that the DRV is in thorough political control in North VN and "when Ho is no longer active, there will probably be a struggle for power between the Moscow-oriented and the Peking-oriented elements of the Party." Dissatisfaction continues in South VN with Diem’s leadership. The Army continues to be a major factor in future political developments in the South. The outlook is for a prolonged and difficult struggle between the VC insurgents and the GVN. NIE 14.3/53-61, 15 August 1961..................................
27.	The President approves the following actions: (1) intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve Souvanna’s agreement to the Paris proposals; (2) authorization to undertake conversations with SEATO allies on an enlarge-went of the concept'of SEATO Plan 5t and (3) an increase in U.S. advisors in Laos. NSAM 80, 29 August 1961...............
28.	The JCS sends the Secretary of Defense a draft memorandum for the President on military intelvention in Laos. The JCS suggests that if the President decides that U.S. forces should be employed in Laos, that SEATO Plan 5 is the proper basic vehicle for the contemplated action. The political objective of the intervention is to confront the Sino-Soviet Bloc with a military force of Asian and western powers capable of stopping the communist advance. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 661-61, 20 September, 1961.......................................................
29.	The Bureau of Intelligence and Research assesses the crisis in South VN and analyzes the short term prospects. The study recognizes that communist progress toward its objective of overthrowing President Diem has been substantial. Since 1960, more than 6,500 civilians, officers, and military personnel have been killed or kidnapped. Recent U.S. support has raised Diem’s political stature, but there has been no conclusive, reversal of deteriorating trends. The security situation remains unimproved. However, the Government’s comprehensive CIP, supported by U.S. aid, is beginning to show favorable results. Over the next year, developments in Laos may have more influence on VN than any improvement in the Diem Government. Department of State Research Memorandum RFE-1, 29 September 1961....................
30.	It is estimated that present armed, full-time VC strength is about 16,000, an increase of 12,000 since April of 1960,

and of 4,000 in the past three months, while only 10-20% , of tills strength consists of cadres infiltrated from North VN, the remaining 80-90^ includes remnants of the approximately 10,000 stay-behind personnel who went underground during the 1954-1955 regroupment and evacuation of Vietnamese communist army units following the Indo-China War. Though some weapons and equipment have been infiltrated into South VN, there has been no positive identification of Communist Bloc-manufactured military equipment in South VN. SNIE 53-2-61, 5 October 1961...........................
31.	The JCS feel the time is now past when actions short of intervention by outside forces can reverse the rapidly worsening situation in Southeast Asia. They consider the execution of SEATO Plan 5, or a suitable variation thereof, to be the military minimum commensurate with the situation. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 704-61, 5 October 1961....................................................
32.	It is the opinion of the JCS that the use of SEATO forces at the greatest possible number of entry points along the whole South VN border, i.e., over several hundred miles, is not feasible. Further, the alternative of using SEATO forces to cover solely the 17th parallel is militarily unsound. "what is needed is not the spreading out of our forces throughout SEA, but rather a consolidated effort in Laos where a firm stand can be taken..." A limited interim course of action is provided herewith in the event SEATO Plan 5 is considered politically unacceptable. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 716-61, 9 October 1961............................................................
33.	"For what one man's feel is worth, mine -- based on very close touch with Indo-China in the 1954 war and civil war afterwards until Diem took hold -- is that it is really now or never if we are to arrest the gains being made by the Vietcong." Bundy suggests that an early, hard-hitting operation has a 70/^ chance of success. "The 30^ is that we would wind up like the 'French in 1954; white men can’t win this kind of fight. On a 70-30 basis, I would, myself, favor going in." Bundy memorandum for Secretary McNamara, 10 October 1961.................................................
34.	It is estimated that the Communist Bloc would not commit North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces to a large-scale military attack against South VN or Laos in response to an assumed SEATO action to patrol the GVN coast

and secure the border involving about 25,000 men. Neutral-ist governments in SEA would be most concerned at the increased tension and danger of general hostilities. Nationalist China would be elated with the SEATO action.
SNIE 10-3-6, 10 October 1961.................................... 313
35.	At a meeting with President Kennedy, the following actions were agreed upon: (1) the Defense Department is authorized to send the Air Force Jungle Jim Squadron to VN; (2) General Maxwell Taylor will leave for SVN on a Presidential mission; and (3) the State Department will pursue specific political actions, i.e., protest to the ICC on North VN support of the VC; table a White Paper at the UN; and con-suit with our SEATO allies regarding support in VN. Gil-patric Memorandum for Record, 11 October 1961........................ 322
36.	"with respect to training the Vietnamese Army for the ‘wrong war', it seems clear that in recent months the insurgency in South Vietnam has developed far beyond the capacity of police control. All of the Vietnamese Army successes this past summer have met Viet Cong opposition in organized battalion strength...This change in the situation has not been fully-understood by many U.S. officials. In this regard, there is some concern that the Thompson Mission may try to sell the Malayan concept of police control without making a sufficiently careful evaluation of conditions in South Vietnam." JCS Memorandum for General Taylor, CM-390-61, 12 October 1961................................................................. 324
;	37. The President requests that General Taylor proceed to
Saigon to appraise the situation in South Vietnam and to report his views on the courses of action which the U.S. might take to avoid further deterioration in the situation and eventually to eliminate the threat to the independence of South Vietnam. President Kennedy letter to General Taylor, 13 October 1961......................................... 327
38.	The President directs the following actions be taken: (1) make preparations for the publication of the white Paper on North Vietnamese aggression; (2) develop plans for presentation of the VN case in the UN; (3) introduce the Jungle Jim Squadron into SVN for the purpose of training Vietnamese forces . He indicates that General Taylor should undertake a mission to Saigon. NSAM 104, 13 October 1961....................... 328
39.	It is the conclusion of the BoD General Counselthat the proposed introduction of U.S. combat and logistic forces into VN would constitute violations of Articles 16 and 17 of the '

Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in VN of July 20, 1954. Introduction of U.S, troops even for pur-poses of flood control would still constitute a violation of the Geneva Accords by the Government of VIL If a deci-sion is made to send U.S. troops into VN, the U.S. should justify it on the ground of collective self-defense. "Nothing in the Geneva Accords should be read as abridging the inherent right of Vietnam and the United States to take actions in collective self-defense." DoD General Counsel Memorandum for Mr. Hadyn williams, 26 October 1961..
40.	General Taylor summarizes the fundamental conclusions of his group and his personal recommendations. Taylor con-cludes there is a double crisis in confidence: doubt that the U.S. is determined to save SEA, and doubt that . Diem’s methods can defeat the Communist purposes and methods. Taylor recommends that the U.S. Government join with the GVN in a massive joint effort as part of a total mobilization of GVN resources to cope with both the VC and the ravages of the flood. Specifically, the U.S. C-overn-ment will provide individual administrators, conduct a joint survey of conditions in the provinces, assist the GVN in effecting surveillance and control over the coastal waters, and finally, offer to introduce into South VN a military Task Force to operate under U.S. military control. General Taylor telegram (cite BAGIOOOO5) for President Kennedy, 1 November 1961..............,..................................
41.	Taylor presents his reasons for recommending the introduc-tion of a U.S. military force into South Vietnam. "I have reached the conclusion that this is an essential action if we are to reverse the present downward trend of events... there can be no action so convincing of U.S. seriousness of purpose and hence so reassuring to the people and govern-ment of SVN and to our other friends and allies in SEA as the introduction of U.S. forces into SVN." Taylor suggests that the strategic reserve of U.S. forces is seriously weak and that U.S. prestige would be more heavily engaged in SVN by this action. However, the size of the U.S. force introduced need not be great to provide the military pres-ence necessary to produce the desired effect. General Taylor telegram (cite BAGI00006) for President Kennedy, 1 November 1961.................................................
42.	The JCS and Secretary McNamara do not believe major units of U.S. forces should be introduced in SVN unless the U.S. is willing to commit itself to the clear objective of preventing the fall of SVN to communism and to support this

commitment by military action and preparation for possible later action. They recommend that the U.S commit itself to this objective and support the recommendations of General Taylor toward its fulfillment. Secretary of Defense Memorandum for the President, 8 November 1961............ 343
43.	The head of the British Advisory Mission submits to Diem his plan for clearing the VC from the Delta. The central idea is the creation of a network of "strategic hamlets" akin to those employed successfully by Thompson in defeating the communist guerillas in Malaya. R.G.K.

41	Reversing the November 8 Defense recommendation for a commitment of substantial U.S. ground forces to South Vietnam	.
this November 11 Rusk-McNamara memorandum to the President (perhaps prepared at Kennedy’s specific direction) escalates the rhetoric regarding U.S. interest in a free South Vietnam, but restricts the military recommendation: (a) employ only support forces now; (b) defer any decision to send "larger organized units with actual or potential direct military missions." Whether Kennedy fully accepted the highblown statements of U.S. interest and commitment to the GVN is not known. State/Defense Memorandum to the President, 11 November 1961................................................. 359
45.	The Joint Staff submits to the Chairman, JCS, briefs of the military actions contained in the draft National Security Action Memorandum resulting from the Taylor Mission Report. The military actions indexed pertain to the use of significant and/or substantial U.S. forces, provision of increased airlift, provision of additional equipment and U.S. personnel, provision of training and equipment for the Civil Guard and SDC, and finally, overhaul of the GVN military establishment and command structure. In connection with the draft memorandum, the Joint Staff considersit militarily desirable to pre-position forces and equipment and is currently considering augmentation of U.S. Army Forces Pacific, with one infantry division plus appropriate logistic and combat support units. Joint Staff Memorandum for the Chairman of the JCS, 14 November 1961...................................... 368
46.	Rusk instructs Ambassador Nolting to seek an immediate appointment with President Diem to inform him that President Kennedy has decided that the Government of the U.S. is prepared to join the Government of VN in a sharply increased joint effort to avoid further deterioration in the situation of SVN. The joint effort requires certain undertakings by

P^e
both governments. On its part, the U.S. would immediately support the GVN with increased airlift, additional equipment, U.S. personnel, expedited training and equipping of the Civil Guard and increased economic aid. The GVN, however, would have to initiate the following actions: (1) begin prompt legislative and administrative action to put the nation on a wartime footing to mobilize its resources;
(2) give governmental wartime agencies adequate authority to perform their functions effectively; and (3) overhaul the military establishment and command structure to create an effective military organization. "President Kennedy contemplates an immediate strong affirmative reply to satisfactory letter along indicated lines from President Diem, which will simultaneously be made public." Rusk NIACT 619 to Saigon, 15 November 1961................................... 400
47.	After three days of talks in Saigon, Ambassador Galbraith feels there is scarcely "the slightest practical chance that the administrative and political reforms being pressed upon Diem will result in real change." Gailbraith sees a comparatively well equipped army of a quarter million men facing 15 to 18,000 lightly armed men. "...there is no solution that does not involve a change of government... to say there is no alternative (to Diem) is nonsense." Ambassador Gailbraith Memorandum for the President, 20 November 1961..................................................... 40b
48.	"The key and inescapable point then is the ineffectuality (abetted debatably'- by the unpopularity) of the Diem Govern-ment. This is the strategic factor. Nor can anyone accept the statement of those who have been either too long or too little in Asia that it is the inevitable posture of the Asian mandarin. For one thing, it isn’t true, but were it so, the only possible conclusion would be that there is no future for mandarins. The communists don’t favor them." Gailbraith feels that it is politically naive to expect that Diem will reform either administratively or politically in any effective way. "However, having started on this hopeless game, we have no alternative but to play it out for a minimum time...since there is no chance of success we must do two things to protect our situation. One is to make clear that our commitment is to results and not to promises...and we can press hardest in the area of Army reform where the needed changes are most specific and most urgent." It follows from Gailbraith's reasoning that the only solution must be to drop Diem, and we should not be alarmed by the Army as an alternative.

49.	The U.S. is prepared to join the VN Government in a sharply increased joint effort to avoid a further deterioration in the situation in SVN.

53-	McNamara confirms to Rusk the command arrangements under which the senior U.S. military commander in Vietnam will have the title "Commander, U.S. Military Assistance Forces -Vietnam" and will have equivalent rank to the Ambassador, reporting through CINCPAC to the JCS. Secretary of Defense Memorandum for the Secretary of State, 18 December 1961..........
54.	Diem is apprehensive about giving control authority to Big Minh as military field commander because of his fear of a coup. While U.S. policy is to support Diem and he has been so informed by the President, we must find a way to reassure him about a coup. "It is the basis for his real reluctance to do what the Americans want him to do and this basic point needs resolving...what realistic assurances can we give Diem that the action he fears won’t take place?"

55.	The Chairman of the JCS summarizes the current situation in VN, methods of VC operations, routes of infiltration and supply, relative strengths, and discusses U.S. military units in place or enroute to VN. "The objectives ■ of the Diem Government in SVN include not only survival against the communists, but also improvement of the national economy, enhancement of SVN's position among Southeast Asian nations, creations of an effective armed force, and preservation of a pro-Western orientation. "Policies directed toward the achievement of these objectives suffer from the concentration of power in the hands of the President, Ngo Dinh Diem, and a small clique headed by his extremely influential and powerful brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu." Chairman JCS Talking Paper for Briefing President Kennedy, 9 January 1962....................... 428
56.	The JCS agree that the basic issue of Diem’s apprehension about a coup needs to be resolved. "I don’t believe there is any finite answer to the question you pose as to how to convince Diem he must delegate authority to subordinates he doesn't fully trust." JCS Memorandum for General Lansdale, CM-491-62, 18 January 1962............................................................      440
57.	The President establishes a Special Group (Counter Insurgency), the functions of which are as follows: (1) to insure proper recognition throughout the U.S. Government that subversive insurgency ("wars of liberation") is a major form of politico-military conflict equal in importance to conventional warfare; (2) to insure that such recognition is reflected in the organization, training, equipment and doctrine of the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. agencies; (3) to continually review the adequacy of U.S. resources to deal with insurgency; and (4) to insure the development of adequate programs aimed at preventing or defeating insurgency. NSAM 124, 18 January 1962................... 442
58.	State Department agrees that an increase in the Vietnamese armed forces to the 200,000 man level should be supported provided the following factors are considered: (1) that U.S. military advisors and the Vietnamese authorities continue to set valid tactical and strategic plans; (2) the rate of increase should consider the ability of the Army to absorb and train the additional men and the manpower resources of SVN; (3) that the armed forces should level off at 200,000 and further efforts should be devoted to

59.	Secretaiy McNamara forwards a JCS Memorandum to the President with the comment, "I am not prepared to endorse the views of the Chiefs until we have had more experience with our present program in SVN." The JCS Memorandum recommends that if, with Diem’s full cooperation and the effective employment of SVN armed forces, the VC is not brought under control, then a decision should be made to deploy suitable U.S. military combat forces to SVN sufficient to achieve desired objectives.

61.	The President approves training objectives for personnel who may have a role to play in counter insurgency programs as well as in the entire range of problems involved in the modernization of developing countries. The training objectives include the study of: the historical background of counter insurgency, departmental tactics and techniques to counter subversive insurgency, instruction in counter insurgency program planning, specialized preparations for service in underdeveloped areas. Training of foreign nationals will also be included in the program. The President desires that current counter insurgency training be examined to ascertain if it meets the above training objectives. NSAM 131, 13 March 1962....................................    457
62.	The President forwards-a memorandum on the subject of VN from Ambassador Galbraith and requests Department cf Defense comments. The Gailbraith Memorandum (4 April 62) asserts that the U.S. is backing a weak and ineffectual government inSVN and that "there is a consequent danger that we shall replace the French as the colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did." Gailbraith urges that U.S. policy keep open the door for political solution, attempt to involve other countries and world opinion in a settlement, and reduce our commitment tc Me present leadership of GVN.

63.	The JCS comment on Ambassador Galbraith’s Memorandum to President Kennedy. The JCS cite the Kennedy letter of 14 December 1961 to President Diem as a public affirmation of the intention of the U.S. Government to support President Diem to whatever extent necessary to eliminate the VC threat. In sum, it is the JCS opinion that the present U.S. policy toward SVN as announced by the President "be pursued vigorously to a successful conclusion." JCS Memo-	.

69.	In a year-endsummary of the Vietnamese situation and prognosis, Hilsman (State INR) concludes that at best the rate of deterioration has been decreased.

70.	A National Intelligence Estimate states that "Communist progress has been blunted'and that the situation is improving. Strengthened South Vietnamese capabilities and effectiveness, and particularly U.S. involvement, are causing the Viet Cong increased difficulty, although there are as yet no persuasive indications that the Communists have been grievously hurt." The VC will continue to wage a war of attrition and there is no threat of overt attack from the North. On the basis of the last year’s progress the VC can be contained but it is impossible "to project the future course of the war with any confidence. Decisive campaigns have yet to be fought and no quick and easy end to the war is in sight." NIE 53-63, "Prospects in South Vietnam," 17 April 1963............................................... 522
71.	The President approves and directs certain actions outlined in the Department of State Memorandum of 17 June 1'963, relative to Laos planning. The President wishes to obtain suggestions for actions in Laos in light of the deteriorating situation and from the British and the French before initiating any action under the Memorandum. Kennedy asks about additional U.S. actions to be taken in Laos before any action directed against NVN. NSAM 249, 25 June 1963...	525

of getting rid of the Nhus (the combined judgment was that it would not be possible), pressure on Diem to take political actions, possible results of a coup, and the replacement of Ambassador Nolting with Ambassador Lodge. Department of State Memorandum of Conversation, 4 July 1963............................................................ 526
73.	A Special National Intelligence Estimate evaluates the political crisis in South Vietnam arising from the Buddhist protest. It concludes that if Diem does not seek to conciliate the Buddhists new disorders are likely and there will be better than even chances of coup or assassination attempts. U.S-GVN relations have deteriorated as a function of Diem’s distrust of U.S. motives in the Buddhist affair and he may seek to reduce the U.S. presence in Vietnam. The Communists have thus far not exploited the Buddhist crisis and they would not necessarily profit from a non-Communist overthrow. A successor regime with continued U.S. support would have good chances of effectively pursuing the war. SNIE 53-2-63, "The Situation in South Vietnam,” 10 July 1963............................................... 5^9
74.	In a subsequently controversial cable, State informs Lodge that if Diem is unwilling or unable to remove Nhu from the government, that the U.S. will have to prepare for alternatives. Lodge is authorized to inform the Vietnamese generals plotting a coup that if Nhu is not removed we will be prepared to discontinue economic and military aid, to accept a change of government and to offer support in any period of interim breakdown of the central government mechanism. State Department Message to Saigon 243, State to Lodge, 24 August 1963................................................................. 536
75.	U.S. policy with respect to a coup is defined in more detail for Lodge and Harkins as a result of an NSC meeting with the President. "The USG will support a coup which has good chance of succeeding but plans no direct involvement of U.S. armed forces. Harkins should state (to the generals) that he is prepared to establish liaison with the coup planners and to review plans, but will not engage directly in joint coup planning." Lodge is authorized to suspend aid if he thinks it will enhance the chances of a successful coup. State Department Message 272, State to Lodge and Harkins, 29 August
1963 ..•••••••••...........................................      538

feels that if accompanied by the threat of a real sanction --i.e., the withdrawal of U.S. support -- such an approach could be timed to coincide with the readiness of the generals to make their move and might, therefore, offer some promise of getting Diem to act. State Department Message 279, State to Lodge, 29 August 1963.....................................    539
77.	Vice President Johnson presides over a meeting at the State Department on the subject of SV?-. The generals’ plot having aborted, Rusk asks what in the situation "lead us to think well of a coup.” Further, Rusk feels that it is unrealistic now "to start off by saying that Nhu has to go." McNamara approves Rusk's remarks. Hilsman presents four basic factors bearing on the current situation: (1) the restive mood of the South Vietnamese population; (2) the effect on U.S. programs elsewhere in Asia of the current GVN policy against the Buddhists; (3) the personality and policies of Nhu; and (4) U.S. and world opinion. Vice President has great reservations about a coup because he sees no genuine alternative to Diem. General Krulak Memorandum for the Record, 31 August 1963........................................................   540
78.	Lodge is instructed by the white House that since there is no longer any prospect of a coup,pressure must be applied to Diem to get him to adopt an extensive list of reforms. In particular Lodge is authorized to hold up any aid program if he thinks such action will give him useful leverage in dealing with Diem. CAP Message 63516, White House to Lodge, 17 September 1963................................................................. 545
79.	The President explains to Lodge his urgent need for the McNamara-Taylor assessment of the situation.	.
The visit is not designed to be a reconciliation with Diem, rather he expects McNamara will speak frankly to him about the military consequences of the political crisis. State Department Message 431, The President to Lodge, 18 September 1963..........................................................   548
80.	Lodge’s reply to the White House CAP Message 63516. indicates agreement that a coup is no longer in the offing, but opposes both an approach to Diem on reforms or the use of an aid suspension as a lever. He regards both as likely to be unproductive or worse. Embassy Saigon Message 544, Lodge to State for President Only, 19 September 1963.......................... 549

the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the VC." While the results from programs developed after Taylor’s Mission in 1961 were heartening, the serious events in the South since May 1963 have prompted the President to ask McNamara to make a fresh, first-hand appraisal of the situation. "In my judgement the question of the progress of the contest in SVN is of the first importance..." President Kennedy Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 September 1963................................... 551
82.	Pending McNamara’s visit and the subsequent review of policy, Lodge is given the following interim guidance: "(1) The United States intends to continue its efforts to assist the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the Viet Cong. (2) Recent events have put in question the possibility of success in these efforts unless there can be important improvements in the government of South Vietnam. (3) It is the policy of the United States to bring about such improvement." State Department Message 458, Eyes Only for Lodge from Ball, 22 September 1963.......°...... 553
83.	The McNamara-Taylor Mission Report concludes that the military campaign has made great progress, and, while the political crisis in Saigon is serious, "tlere is no solid evidence of the possibility of a successful coup..." The Report recommends against promoting a coup and, although it is not clear that U.S. pressure will move Diem to the moderations and reforms we desire, nevertheless, as the only course of action with any prospect of producing results, the report recommends the application of selective economic sanctions, including a suspension of funds for the commodity import program. 'The Mission further recommends a shift of military emphasis to the Delta and a consolidation of the Strategic Hamlet Program. In addition, it is recommended that a training program be established for RVNAF such that the bulk of U.S. personnel may be withdrawn by the end of 1965. In conjunction with this program, the U.S. should announce plans to withdraw 1, 000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963.• 554
84.	Lodge is advised that as a result of the policy review just completed, the "President today approved recommendation that no initiative should now be taken to give any active covert encouragement to a coup." Efforts to build and maintain contacts with "alternative leadership" is authorized, however. CAP Message 63560, to Lodge via CAS channel, 5 October

86.	washington reaffirms Lodge’s guidance that he is not to promote a coup. Neither, however, is he to thwart one. He should try to obtain as much information as possible from the plotters about their plans on which to base an American judgement about their likelihood of success. CIA Message 74228, 6 October 1963........................................... 577
87.	The President approves the detailed military recommendations contained in the McNamara-Taylor Report, but directs chat no announcement of the implementation of the 1,OOO-man withdrawal plan be made. NSAM 263, 11 October 1963.................. 578
88.	A Department of State Research Memorandum contends that the statistical indicators on the war in Vietnam reveal "that the military position of the Vietnam Government may have reverted to the point it had reached six months to a year ago." The analysis angers the JCS and Rusk subsequently apologizes to McNamara. Department of State, INR Research Memorandum RFE-9O, 22 October 1963.............................. 579
89.	With the coup plotting now far advanced and the U.S. clearly committed to the generals’ attempt, Lodge seeks to calm washington’s anxieties about the lack of detailed informa-	•
tion on the generals’ plans. He is at pains to oppose any thought of thwarting the coup because he thinks the military will create a government with better potential for carrying on the war, and because it would constitute undue meddling in Vietnamese affairs. Embassy Saigon Message
1964, Lodge to McGeorge Bundy, 25 October 1963........ 590

91.	The White House instructs Lodge to bring General Harkins completely up to date on the coup plotting, and asks that ’ Harkins, Lodge and the CIA Station Chief provide a combined assessment of the prospects of the plotters. Indi-vi dual comments are to be sent if desired, with these assessments, a decision can be made telling the generals:

1963....................................................... 593
92.	After complaining about Lodge’s failure to keep him informed about the coup planning, General Harkins opposes the proposed coup against Diem. He does not see an alternative leadership with Diem's strength of character, especially not among the generals. The war continues to go well. MACV Message 2028, Harkins to Taylor, 30 October	595
1963.......................................................
93.	General Harkins takes detailed exception to the interpretations of a deteriorating war effort that Lodge has been transmitting throughout October. He offers an optimistic appraisal of the trend of-the war and sees the political crisis as having only a marginal effect on troop morale and military effectiveness. MA-CV Message 2033, Harkins to Taylor, 30 October 1963...................................... 597
94.	Lodge argues forcefully for the coup. "It is theoretically possible for us to turn over the information which has been given to us in confidence to Diem and this would undoubtedly stop the coup and would make traitors out of us. For practical purposes, therefore, I would say that we have very little influence on what is essentially a Vietnamese affair." In the event the coup fails, he believes we should do what we can to help evacuate the generals’ dependents. Lodge believes the generals are all taking enormous risks for the sake of their country and their good faith is not to be questioned. "Heartily agree that a miscalculation could jeopardize position in Southeast Asia. We also run tremendous risks by doing nothing." General Harkins did not concur in the cable. CAS Saigon Message 2063, 30 October 1963............................................................ 600
95.	Taking note of the difference of opinion on the advisability of a coup between Lodge and Harkins, the white House specifically informs Lodge that he is to discourage the generals from any attempt that in his judgement has a poor prospect of success. Lodge is given full authority for country team actions in the event of a coup; if he has left for Washington, Harkins will have charge. In the event of a coup, U.S. policy will be: (a) to reject appeals for direct intervention from either side; (b) if the contest is indecisive, U.S. authorities may perform any actions agreed

MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
From:
BrigGcn Lansdale, OSO/OSD
Subj:
Vietna m
As desired by you, I visited Vietnam 2-14 January 1961. After twelve days of intensive looking and listening over some old familiar ground, I have come to the following persona! convictions:
a.
1961 promises to be a fateful, year for Vietnam.
,t
L
b.
The Communist Viet Cong hope to win back Vietnam south
of the l7th Parallel this year, if at all possible, and are much further along towards accomplishing this objective than I had realized from reading the reports received in Washington.
. c. The free Vietnamese, and their government, probably wiIJ be able to do no more than postpone eventual defeat - - unIess they find a Vietnamese way of mobilizing their total resources and then utilizing them with spirit.
d.	The U. S. team in Vietnam will be unable to help the Vietnamese with real effeCtiveness, unless the U.S. system of their operation is Changed suffieiently to free these Americans to do the job that needs doing, and unless they do it with sensitive understanding and wisdom.	’
e.	T£ Free. Vietnam is won by the Communists, the remainder of Southeast Asia will be easy piekings for our enpmy, because the toughest local, force on our side will be gone. A Communist victory also would be a major blow to U. S. prestige and influence, not only ' in Asia but througFlOut the world, since the world believes that Vietnam . has rema’ined free only through U.S. help. Such a victory would tell leaders of other governments that it doesn’t pay to be a friend of the U. S. , and would bc an even more marked lesson than Laos.	.
L
f.	Vietnam can be kept free, but it will rcquire a changed U.S. attitude, plenty of hard work and patience, and a new spirit by the Vietnamese. The Viet Cong have been pushing too hard militarily to get their roots down firmly and can be defeated by an inspired and determined effort.	.	■	.	•	. ■	.

L

g.	Ngo Dinh Diem is still the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President. I believe there will be another attempt to get rid of him soon, unless the U.S. makes it clear that we arc backing him as the .clected top man. ' If the 11 November coup had been successful, I believe that a number of highly selfish and mediocre people would be squabbling among them-■ sclvcs for power while the Communists took over. The Communists will be more alert to exploit the next coup attempt. At present, most Vietnamese, oppositionists believe that the U. S. would look favorably upon a successful coup.
h.	Vietnam has progressed faster in material things than it has spiritually. The people have more possessions but are . tarting to lose the will to protect their liberty. There is a big lcsson here to be learned about the U.S. aid program which needs some most serious study.
Recommendations
Before I left Saigon, I discussed my impressions with Ambassador Durbrow who was most gracious towards me during the visit. Included in these impressions was my feeling that many of the Americans in Saigon pcrhaps subconciously believed in defeat, probably h?.d spent too much time and energy on the political situation in Saigon instead of on . the very real Viet Cong menace, and were in need of some bolstering up by the Chief of Mission. In this feeling of defeat, I would have to exccpt the Chief of MAAG and the local CIA Chief who believe we can win. Ambassador Durbrow tofd rne of the memo he had issued to all Americans in Saigon after the 11 November coup attempt. I said this was a good move, but much more than writing a paper was needed.
He asked me what suggestions I had. I said that I didn’t have . much immediately, and would have to do a lot of thinking about it. The . situation in Vietna.m is not black and white, but a most complex one in alt shades of gray. Many Americans and Vietnamese expected me to come up with some sort of a miracle, to turn Ngo Dinh Diem into an Americanized, modern version of the ancient.Vietnamese leader Le Loi. However, the task requires more than a gimmiCk or some simple answer. It will take a lot of hard work and. follow-through. In 12	.
days, all I Could do was learn as much as I could and to "plant a seed or two" with Ngo Dinh Diem and other Vietnamese leaders who know that I speak out of deep affection for the free Vietnamese.

SinCe leaving Vietnam, I have spent many hours thinking about the . . situation there. I am far from having a complete proposal to solve the situation. However, I do have soinc recommendations now for steps * which should be taken to start remedying the dow'nhill and dangerous
' trend in Vietnam. They are:	»	■ •	• .	-	.
a. The U. S. should recognize that Vietnam is in a critical condition and should treat it as a cornbat area of the cold'war, as an area
• • • „ * . .
requmng emergency treatment.
- . . .
b.	When thore is an emergency, the wise thing to do is to pick the best people you have, people who are experienced in dcaling with this precise type of emergency, and send them to the spot v/ith orders
.	• to remedy the situation. When yout get the people in pc jition and free
them to work, you should then baok them up in ever}’ practical way you can. The real decisions will be made in little daily actions in Vietnam, not in Washington. That’s why the best arc needed on the spot.

that "Gardiner seems to be a nice man who has fallen asleep in pur r' imate. "
h.	U.S. military men in Vietnam should be freed to work in the v combat areas. Our MAAG has a far greater potential than is now being utilized. U.S. military men are hardly in a position to be listened to when they are snug in rcar areas and give advice to Vietnamese officers who have attended the same U.S. military SChools and who are now in
. a combat in which few Americans are experienced. MAAG personnel from General McGarr on down expressed desire to get more into real field work; let's give them what they want as far as U.S. permission is concerned and let them earn their way into positions of greater influence with the Vietnamese military in the field.
i.	A mature American, with much the same qualifications as those given above for the selection of the next Ambassador, should be assigned to Vietnam for political operations which will start creating । a Vietnamese-style foundation for more democratic government with-|jout weakening the strong leadership required to bring about the defeat of t the Communists.

I Vietnam from the Communists by building something worth a man's life to preserve. If it's a good program, v/e should encourage one ■ strong political opposition to emerge, without endangering the national . security. Here is where out political skill needs to'be used. This political work is needed as a matter of grave urgency. Unless a con-

The Communist Threat
with
It was a shock to me to look over maps of the estimated situation J.S. and Vietnamese intelligenCe personnel, as well as with
President Diem who held similar grim views. The Communist Viet Cong now dominate much of the lst and 5th Military Regions, as well as being aCtive in spots in other regions, aCcording to these estimates. The probable strength of the Communist armed forces in South Vietnam was givcn to me in various gucsses from 3, 000 to 15, 000. My guess is that the strength is now closer to the latter figure and that only Hanoi knows aCcurately.	•
This strength estimate by itself isn’t what shocked me. The shocking part was to realize that the thousands of disciplined and trained ' Communist graduates of "proletarian military science" had been able to infiltrate the most productive area of South Vietnam and to gain control of nearly all of it except for narrow Corridors proteotcd by military notions and for a few highly-localized spots where loyal paramilitary forces (Civil Guards ?.nd Self-Defnese Corps) have undertrtken inspired Counter-guerrilla actions or where villagers work closely with the military.	•
. The Viet Cong have the initiative and most of the control over the region from the jungled foothills of the High Plateau north of Saigon all the way south dov/n to the Gulf of Siam, excluding the big City area of Saigon-Cholon. This is Vietnam’s "bread-basket" where most of its rice and rubber are grown.
Unlike the Philippines or Malaya, the Communists cannot be Cordoned off at the country's borders and then dealt with as an internal security problem alone. The borders of Vietnam are long and include some of the most difficult terrain in the world to patrol. It is apparent that many of the Viet Cong infiltrate from Cambodia, partiCularly from Svayrieng Province. Also, southeastern Laos has a reported Comint nist •

build-up, with RLG forces committed elsewhere, and increasing Infiltration into Vietnam is reported.
There is an intense psychological attack being waged against Free Vietnam by the Communists. This not only includes an almost constant barrage from powerful Radio Hanoi, which is rcportedly relayed from Cambodia and is received as a loud and clear signal in South Vietnam, but also a heavy campaign by on-the-spot agitprop agents. A part of the psychological attack is directed against Americans, particularly against U.S. MAAG personnel, along the lines of the Chinese Communist "hate America” campaign. I did not have the time or means to assess the effect of this psychological attack which has been going on for years.

The big city area of Saigon-Cholon undoubtedly is a target of Communist operations, although I was able to find out little about either the Communist organization or its operations in this city area. U.S. intelligence personnel believed that Vietnamese counter-intelli-' gence organizations were so actively "hustling" so. many suspects that the Communists have been unable to institute much of an organization. President Diem believed that the Communists were concentrating their work elsewhere, following the dictum: "first the mountains, then the Countryside, and then the city. " The attitude of Vietnamese and U.S. offiCials reminded me of the French and Vietnamese officials in Hanoi in 1953-54, who were so surprised later to discover that a complete, block-by-hlock clandestine Communist apparatus existed there. O.q of Filipinos and Afnericans .who believed the links were in central Luzon in 1950 and were so surprised when an. entire Communist politburo was captured in the city of Manila. I believe that the people in Saigon-Cholon have been the targct of considerable subversive effort by the Communists and that it takes an in-place organization. tQ carry this out.	....	.
Communist strength figures arc diffioult to determine due in part to the different categories of personnel. I was able to get no estimate on the number of.Communist political-psychologiCal operators, although the DRV reportedly have trained many for work in the south. Also, the Communist military personnel include regulars who have infiltrated from the north, plus territorial forces and guerrillas who apparently are recruited locally. Colonel Tranh Thicn Khiem, who commands the 5th Military Region, broke his estimate of some 7, 000 Viet Cong military in his region into 3, 320 regulars, 1, 170 territorials, and 2,590 guerrillas.

behind in the south, along with stay-behind organizations and arms caches. Although the pacification campaigns of 1955-56 cleaned up what the Communists had left behind to .sonic extent, there were remnants remaining which the Viet Cong have since exploited and augmented- . greatly over the past 5 years.	.
President Ngo Dinh Diem
President Diem and I are friends. Also, he is a man who put other Vietnamese friends of mine in jail or exiled them. It is hardly a blind friendship.
Prior to my departure from Washington, Jeff Partons asked if
I would please size-up President Diem carefully to see if he had Changed much from when I had worked with him so closely in 1954-56. In our first meeting, hc was a Mt cautious with me. I suspected that he was v/aiting for me to drop Washington’s other shoe as a follow-up to the Ambassador's demands that he reform his ways. So, I reminisced on what we had been through together in the past and he joined in, adding the story of the 11 November coup as he saw it, Our meetings from then on became more like the. old days, with plenty of give and take. . . but only after I convinced him that I still had affection for the Viet. namese people and was trying to understand their problems before
. sounding off.	.	•
He seems to have a better grasp of economic matters than formerly. Also, I believe he sincerely wants to pass some of his daily burden of work to others. He said that he had found this extremely hard to do, since too many others were soft in carrying out responsibilities or else were too vain to knuckle - down to hard work. This has forced him to over-burden Nguyen Dinh Thuan, SeCretary of State for the Presidency, ' v/ho doesn’t hesitate to make tough decisions when needed, who has had to act as hatchet-man when others were too soft to get rid of incompe- • tents, and who has been loyal to his boss (although he" speaks right up for his own views). Vice President Tho is so soft-hearted that he
1 really never takes corrective action against wrong doers. Vu Van Thai is a ’'blackmailer" by threatening to resign after convincing the Americans that he is the most brilliant Vietnamese in economic matters, although
• he is a poor executive whose work is in bad shape; if Diem acoepted Thai's resignation, the Americans would feel that the Vietnamese Government was going to hell. (Unfortunately, theie's some truth in these .feelings of Diem’s about Tho and Thai).

I believe President Diem is more screened in by his "palace guaNd" than He realises - - but then much the same could be said of other leaders elscwhere. I noted that lie still has a personal informant - net and I managed to talk to some of them privately. The largest influence, but net the only one, is wield.cd by his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. However, I found President Diem unusually well informed on the situation in Vietnam, including the bad aspects - - better informed than any other Vietnamese among the many with whom I talked.
In reflecting on our conversations, I have Concluded that most folks who talk to him have little empathy for, or sensitve undcrstanding of, him. They fail' to realize that Diem is human and doesn't like tile idea of people trying to kill him out of hatred; the coup attempt of 11 November opened at 3 a.m, by bursts of heavy machine gun fire into his bedroom in an obvious try at liquidating him in his bed. On top of this, he has no v had nearly 7 years of venomous attack by the Communists who know that he is a major obstacle v/hich must be destroyed before they can win.
This is a daily psychological attack on hirn in his own country, in his own language, and listened to by his own people. The only way he could shut this off today would be to give up what he, and we, believe in.
On top of this, F.e Eras Criticism heaped on him by many who are simply being des true five, he has administrators who are disloyal or whose vanity is expressed in talking a better job of work than in. doing it. And then, to cap the criticisms, lie feels that many Americans have con-tempt for him - - that the .U. S. v/hich sould be Vietnam's staunchest friend is somehow taking the same psychological line with him. as do
e Communists, that somehow our nobly-expressed policies get carried
cut with, much pettiness in actual practice. •
If the next American official to talk to President Diem would have the good sense to see him as a human being v/ho has been through a lot ( of hell for years -- and not as an opponent to be beaten to his knees --we would start regaining our influence with him in a healthy v/ay. Whatever else we might think of him, he has been unselfish in devoting his life to his country and has little in personal belongings to shovz for it.
. lf we don:t like the-heavy influence of Brother Nhu, then let’s move Someone of ours in dose. This someone, however, must be able to look at problems with understanding, suggest better solutions than does Nhu., earn a position of influence.
The next time we become "holier than thou”, we might find it st boring to reflect on the DRV. Do the Soviets and the Chinese Com-munists give Ho Chi Minh a similar hard time, or do they aid and abet hirn?	~	'

U. S. Political Efforts
The United States has been the main foreign political mentor for Free Vietnam since it beCamc an independent nation. Of course other nations have had their influence. But we were the ones v/ho have spoken with authority, who have held the purse-strings, v/ho trained and adviscd the government personnel, and to whom most Vietnamese in political

else to blame for what has gone wrong. But, v/e won't be able to start ’ doing effective political work until we admit that our own actions carry responsibilities with them. There are plenty of Aaron Burr's, a few Alexander Hamilton's and practically no George Washington's, Tom Jefferson,Js or Tom Paine's in Saigon today . . . largely as a result of our U.S. political influence. This certainly is not the U.S. policy we had hoped to implement.
• Ambassador Durbrow seemed genuinely surprised when I told him that the Can Lao Party in Vietnam was originally promoted by the U.S. State Department and was largely the brain-child of a highly-respected, senior U.S. Foreign Servioe professional. Several weeks j after this action was undertaken originally, I lcarned of it and warned that the benefits were extremely short-tcrm and that great lasting
.harm could result by a favored party foroing older parties to go under-‘ ground. However, the decision had been made, the Can Lao party had
'• becn started, and we had to start working from that reality. We cannot go back to living in the past and must keep moving ahead, but that
. doesn't mean that we havc to pay forever for our mistakes.
However, the real point is that we don't seem to have very long memories or enough solid feeling of responsibility for out acts. Many U.S. Foreign Service offidals leap into attacks on the Can Lao Party. I agree with their reasons. Any thinking American would. But I sure would fed better about it if they could only remember the consequences of their ov/n actions for a few short years - and learn from that memory. I cannot truly sympathize with Americans v/ho help promote a fascistic ' state and then get angry when it doesn’t act like a democracy.
So, what should we do about it? I have a concrete recommendation. VZe nced an American in Saigon who Can work, with real skill, with great sensitivity to Vietnamese feelings, and v/ith a fine sense of the dangerous limits of Vietnamese national security in a time of emergency. This upusual American should be given the task of creating

1	It can happen, and soon,
I saw a number of opposition people, officials of various parties, members of the National Assembly, and disgruntled members of President Diem’s administration. They eagerly told rnc how they were ,	criticizing Diem’s actions more and more openly. I asked them what
their own program was, other than to seize power for themselves or to have rne pat them on the head for being Critics. Few of them had any sensible ideas.

Those who secrned to be in the hardest circumstances, fighting barefoot and with makeshift weapons, had the highest morale. They still can lick the Vict Cong with a little help. There's a lesson here on our giving aid. Maybe we should learn that our funds cannot buy friends or a patriotic spirit by mere materialistic giving. Perhaps we should help those who help themselves, and not have a lot of strings on that help.	• ‘
c. The Viet Cong crowded a lot of action into the year 1960. They infiltrated thousands of armed forces into South Vietnam, recruited local levies of military territorials and guerrillas, and undertook large scale guerrilla and terroristic operations. In so . domg,.they neglected doing sound political work at the grass roots level and broke one of Mao Tse Tung's cardinal rules. Many people • in the south now under their thumb are unhappy about it, but too terrif:ed to act against these new rulers. The Viet Cong apparently . • . .havc-been working hard recently, to-rectify this error, and now halve political cadres in the field. We still have a chance of beating them if wc can give the people some fighting chance of gaining security and some political basis of action. Since both of these actions will have to be carried out by Vietnamese forces in their Defense estab-Ilshmcnt, it is worthwhile to make U.S. help to the Vietnamese in the contested provinces along these sorely needed lines a priority mission of the U.S. military in Vietnam, The political actions should be the implcrnenting of Vietnamese governmental policy bv Vjehnrnese

VIETNAM
I. Background

r
Vietnam today is largely the child of the 1954 Geneva Agreement.
The Geneva Agreement was billed as a "cease-fire” between the French and Vietminh armed forces for all of Indo-China, and was forged in the gloom of the French disaster at Dien-Bien-Phu. The British and Soviets were its sponsors. Thc U.S. was an observer, not a signatory.
The political portions introduced into the agreement by the Communists should be noted carefully. Among these are the temporary partition of Vietnam with provision for a plebiscite, the establishing of an international inspection cotnmission, and a proviso for keeping a military status quo in weaponry.

Vietnam was partitioned at the l7th Parallel. This gave the Communist North the majority of the population (estimated then at • 14 million) and its most important industries (including coal and . Cement). The Free South had an estimated 12 million people and an export potential of rice and rubber.
r
L_
The plebisCite was to be held in 1956, to determine whether
' Vietnam was to be Free or Communist. Communist control over the majority of the population seemed to make the outcome plain to predict. However, the vigor of the Ngo Dinh Diem government in
' making Free Vietnam a viable state, plus the movement of nearly a million refugees from the Communist North to the Free South, Changed thc political Climate strongly by the end of 1955. The Soviet and British sponsors of the agreement then decided that the plebiscite should be postponed indefinitely.'	'	■

The International Control Coniinission was establishcd, with .
Polish, Indian, and Canadian members. It is still in being, a t-	monument to the ineffectiveness and dangers of such an international
body: theRrce South is observed far more Closely than the Communist North, bccause we play the game legally.
As to the military status quo there were two points; a prohibition, on introducing new weapons into Vietnam and a ceiling on foreign military personnel in thc country (thc number to be no I	more than v/ere in Vietnam at the time of the "cease-fre"). There
were some 400 U.S. military in Vietnam at that time, plus the many thousands of French military. No foreign communists were reported, and the Vietminh had no aircraft at the time.
II.	Today
In the North is the DemoCratic Republic of Vietnam, Its Constitution in key provisions makes it into a Communist state in thc image of the Soviet Union, In January 1961, its population was estimated at 16, 375, 000. Its armed forces total around 300,000, with reported heavy fire power capability in new artillery and tanks. Also, aircraft have been reported, not only transports, but jet
; fighters. In March 1960, it was estimated that there were 6 to 10 i	[ thousand Bloc pcrsonnel in the North, most of whom were advisors
■ to the Vietnamese. About two-thirds v/ere Chinese, the remainder f	being mostly Soviets, East Germans, .and Czechs.
L •	•	..
In the South is the Republic of Vietnam, with a government somewhat patterned on ours. In January 1961, its population was . estimated at 14, 300, 000. Its armed forces total about 150, 000, not counting 64, 000 in the Civil Guard (similar to a stat.c Constabulary) or the 40, 000 in the Self Defense Corps, whiCh is the ill-equipped t	I and untrained .village militia. Official Americans in Vietnam are:
• 98 in thc Embassy, 685 in MAAG, 2.30 in USOM (ICA), and 30 in
i USIS. There are more than a thousand other Aarne ricans, dependents of officials, business people, and missionaries. Only a few French and British remain in Vietnam. U.S. aid to the South, in millions of dollars, is indicated as:

Since 80% of thc population in the South is employed in agriculture, much of the U.S. aid to South Victnam in the years right after 1954, (estimated at over $l-billion), 'went to rehabilitate thc agrarian economy and to settle some 900,000 refugees. The ever-present threat of invasion from the North, and large scale subversivc activities Has required continued expenditure by thc new government to give unusually heavy support to its national security forces. The South now is self-sufficient in basic food-stuffs, but has no heavy industry.
III.	Situation Analysis
The situation map at MAAG in Saigon early this month shows thc South's major current problem at a glance: the Communist
‘internal security threat. (Map attached)
The Communist '’National Liberation Front" claims that the Communists will "liberate" the South in 1961. The main reliance , is on Communist armed forces, now estimated at about 10, 000, who : have been infiltrated into the South from the North (overland through I Cambodia Sad Laos, or by sea in coastal junks), and who fight as 1 guerrillas. These are the Viet’Cong.
L_
As the Free Vietnamese become more effective at countering these Communist guerrillas, (in January and February, the govcrn-. ment initiated 529 attacks on the guerrillas, compared to 310. attacks i initiated by the Viet Cong), the Communists have been forCed to consider further means for winning. Current Communist plans include:
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
a.	Readiness to exploit any future coup d’etat attempts in the South. (The Communists were caught unprepared in last November’s attempt at a non-Communist coup in Saigon).
b.	Use the proposed forthcoming 14 nation conference on Laos as a forum to gain political agreement to a texv partition of Vietnam at the l3th Parallel,
C. Possibly establish an enclave in the Knntum area
>f South Vietnam, using forCes from Attopen in Laos to do this, and start a revolutionary government there.

p
Meanwhile, Free Vietnam has just completed a successful Presidential election, returning Ngo Dinh Diem to office, with Nguyen NgoC Tho as Vice-President. The U.S. Country Team has taken up with Diem’s government a Counter-Ins urgency Plan, mostly written by Americans in Vietnam last year. It is hoped that the implementation of this plan will solve the Viet Cong internal threat. In addition, MAAG-Vietnam has produced a work, "Tactics and Techniques of Counter-Insurgent Operations, " which is being translated for use in Vietnamese military manuals and texts.
Thc Counter-Insurgency Plan calls for bctter-integratcd Control of the military-economic-political effort against the Viet Cong, a more effective Chain-of-Command, improvement of military strength and structure, coordinating and unifying the intelligence effort, gaining more popular support, changing some of Lhe politiCal structure, and increasing the Vietnamese contribution to the economiC support of thc struggle. The Vietnamese have: adopted a number of these proposals, have ohangcd some to more acceptable I Vietnamese forms, and balked at part of the political proposals (the ; inclusion of opposition politicians in the Cabinet and elimination of : the Can Lao party which has supported President Diem).
Diem's actions to achicve objectives of the Counter-Insurgency Plan include:
a.
Thc Civil Guard (constabulary) was transferred
from the Department of Interior to Department of Defennc. 32, 000

Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
of the Civil Guard are now being traincd and equipped by the Army. Since the Vietnamese arc hard put to pay' the cost of the increased burden, U.S. Defense officials suggest that we train and equip the remaining 3 6, 000 Civil Guard immediately. They figure that $20-million would Cover the initial equipment and first year Costs, 17c Could start training and equipping the bcst of the remaining 36, 000 from FY 61 funds.
b. Control and power of the Joint General Staff has been improved, with U.S. advisors in a more favorable position to assist. The Director of the Civil Guard is now subordinate to the Chicf of Staff. Time lag between alert and air strike has been shortened considerably. LogistiCal methods are being improved.
r
C. The Internal Security Council was founded and now meets weekly. Other structural Changes of the government, (such as having "super-Secretaries" in Charge of a group of related Departments), have been announced but await implementation. Thc Vietnamese agreed to having a national planning systcm, as recommended in thc U.S. Plan, and progress is reported.
d.	The Vietnamese government published a decree on the taCtical zone organization, although not as complete as in the U.S. Plan. At the same time, the Vietnamese have accepted, de facto, closer MAAG help at the taCtical level; U.S, military are now adually visiting small tactical units on operations.
e.	The Vietnamese have agrecd to Chief MAAG’s proposed 20,000 additional troops, as in the Plan. Implementation of this increase is tied-up with discussions on the Plan in Saigon. Our Ambassador wants thc Vietnamcse to accept responsibility for pay and allowances of this increase; U.S. Defense offidals propose that the increase be supported thc same as other MAP forCes.
On top of the problem of the Vict Cong actions, and getting thc Counter-Insurgency Plan implemented, there still remains the Continuing threat of a coup against President Diem. Much of this is still parlor talk in Saigon and other urban areas, but there reportedly are groups seriously plotting. Some plain, private
Declassified per Executive Order 13526. Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
talk with key Vietnamese leaders by a responsible U.S, official would end this plotting, espccially if the political oppositionists had another outlet for their energies. A small stv.rt on providin another use of political energies has been made by the younger leaders of the Northern Dai Viets, who have started trying to coalesce all the non-Communist opposition partics in a "Front cor Democratization, ”
In the propaganda field, the Communists are way out in front. They have macle this a major effort, while we have done too little, too late. Radio facilities in the South are still inade-quate, with Radio Hanoi Coming in more powerfully to many areas than do Free Vietnamese broadcasts. The Communists reportedly have ten transmitters in the Hanoi area, all 100 KW medium, and short-wave; relay transmitters built by Chinese Communists in Cambodia apparently give Radio Hanoi strong broadcast coverage of thc South. The South has 15 transmitters listed, -with 9 in the Saigon area; 4 are medium wave (1KW to 5KW), 5 short-wave (12 KW and 25 KW); the remainder are 1 KW transmitters scattered around the country.
In this ConneCtion, Vietnam is the Asian Counterpart of Germany, as far as being a showplace of direct competition between the Free World and the Bloc is Concerned. Americans in Vietnam too often forget that they haye Bloc opposite numbers just to the North of them, working like beavers to make the place get ahead of us or at least appear that way.
One of the customary working groups in Washrngton is being called together next week by John Steeves, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. It will be composed of "desk” personnel handling Vietnam’s daily problems in State, Defense, ICA and C1A. It will address itself to some of the current questions arising out of the U.S. formulated-Counter-Insurgency Plan

1	IV. Action Proposed
The President should at once determine that conditions, in Vietnam arc critical and establish a Washington task force for that country. This will permit the task force to come up with an approved • I plan of action prior to sending a new U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, ' so that he can start moving towards U.S. goals upon arrival.
Initial Actions
1. A Presidential directive should name a Dircctor and provide for members of a Vietnam Task Force from Defense, State, CIA, ICA, and USIA. The organization providing the Director will support the Task Force administratively.
2.	The implementing
3.	The
Task Force will submit a statement of U.S. goals and planning to the President for approval by 21 April.
r
Task Force will prepare a list of Candidates for a
spccial three-man staff for the Ambassador (plans officer, opcra-tions officer, fiscal officer), and will have this staff selected and appointed with the Ambassador’s approval.
4.	Thc Task Force will bring the Ambassador and his three-man staff together in VIashington, "marry" them, and present them to the President for his instructions. •	’	'	’
5.	The Task Force will then supervisc and coordinate the
1 activities of cvcry U.S. agency carrying out operations pursuant to the plan in Vietnam to insure success of the approved plan, until ‘ the contingency in Vietnam is determined to have been overcome and that U.S, goals can be’achicved by normal procedures.
Goals
Present U.S. policy objectives are now stated in general terms. Detailed plans, such as the Counter-Insurgency Plan, only cover part of the notions needed to reach U. S, goals. A fresh statement of goals and tasks, making use of work now underway, would provide firmer purpose to U.S. efforts. True objectives in Vietnam seem to fall into three inter-related parts:	- ■	__

-	Communications and transport should be expanded rapidly to L,	knit national unity. Light air craft capabilities should be improved.
Government officials should be induced to get away frequently from their desks in Saigon for more direct actions in the field. The President should be cncouragcd to hold occasional Cabinet meetings in the provinces, particularly in newly purified areas.
-	The Washington Task Force should send into Vietnam a . praCtical economic team, which should include representatives of U.S. business, to work out with the Vietnamese effective plans to speed up national development, give Vietnam a better tax struCture, and establish a sound basis for foreign investment. The numerous U.S. and other economic plans for Vietnam should be re-examined for sound ideas to be incorporated into a firm new plan.

-	Arcas just south of thc 17th Parallel in Free Vietnam should be developed as show-places, partiCularly in agricultural improve-mcnts.

j - Introduce teams of Free Vietnamese into the North to Create I the means for the people to liberate themselves from Communist controls and coercion. Related actions could be undertaken by Chinese Nationalists in Southern China. Hope could be awakened by taking initial aCtions against symbols of Communist power; thc rail-
i road, the Cement plant, and the large modern printing plan in Hanoi (which the Viet-Minh took in 1955).
-	Encourage again the movement of refugees into thc South by stimulating the desire to do so among the pcople in the North, by establishing better means of ingress to the South, and by re-estab-lishing thc highly successful refugee settlement program. Sustained world opinion should be foCused on the plight of the Northern people in ordcr to bring pressure on the International Control Commission

' North, organized along lines of political-revolution, with the goal ' of freeing the North of Communist control and eventually unifying a Free North with a Free South. Thc movement should be affiliated with the government of South Vietnam.

dom, and election machinery can be set up to proteCt a free vote, .	thc sponsors of thc Geneva Agreement of 1954 should be induCed to

Immediate Stcps
Fullest use should be madc of the existing position o£ personal ‘confidence and understanding which General Lansdale holds with President Diem and other kcy Vietnamese. In addition to giving a major assist to thc new Presidential Task Force for Vietnam in Washington, General Lansdale should acCompany the new U.S. Ambassador to Saigon to facilitate good working relations with thc Vietnamese Government from the earliest moment and to be in Command of the initial imple-mentation of President Kennedy's Task Force Plan for Vietnam. ■ This would spced early actions in the field and assure, upon Lansdale’s return to Washington, that the Task Force in AV as hangton applied itself to p radical priorities to win this one.
While in Vietnam, Lansdale also Could obtain President DiemJs permission and then call non-Comm uni st political opposition leaders together and encourage them to rely on legal means of opposition, to help in the fight against thc Communist Viet Cong, and to cease scheming Coup d’etats.
Other actions he could take while in Vietnam include:
a.	Confer with President Diem on expediting of . obtaining a popular base through sudl means as a "Presidential Complaints and Action Commission, ” This would fit appropriately into the tasks of the Secretary of State for the Presidenoy, where President Diern now has one of his ablest exeCutives, Nguyen Dinh Thuan. Thc Filipino expert on this subject, Frisco Jolmny San Juan, who assisted Magsaysay and who is favorably known to Prcsidcnt Diem, Could be brought to Saigon to help establish this. It would give the peoplc an immediate feeling of personal conneCtibn. with a responsive government.
b.	Visit the Hue area, just south of the demarCation. line of the 17th Parallel,' to see what might be done to dramatize the benefits of U.S. -Vietnam friendship. The Communists are highly aware of what goes on in this region. If American youth from thc Peace Corps workcd side by side with Vletnamese on

some dramatic agrarian projects, in this area, word of this would spread among the farmers throughout thc Communist North and '
.	offer a sharp contrast to the Chinese advisors on the land there.
This could be strengthened quickly by adding a tcam of Filipinos .
• from Operation Brotherhood to work side by side with Arne ricans •and Vietnamese	’ ,	•
c.	Radio broadcasts should be surveyed realistically, for facilitics and Content, to be certain that the word of what free
—	men are doing in Vietnam is heard loudly and acceptably by Vietnamese
who arc staking their lives on freedom’s cause in the South, by
•	Vietnamese who dream of lost frecdom in the Communist North, and
r	‘ by neighbors in Cambodia and Laos. Any mobile radio broadca.sting
equipment and staffs available to the U.S. should be brought in to action here as a priority matter. ;	.
r —
d. A small R&D section could be established in the Victnamcsc Army, to work closely with a small team from U.S. Dcfense, which could be attached to MAAG. This R1D section would actually produce locally materiel for use in thc fight against thc Viet Cong, as well as offer a Vietnamese means of introducing
' improved American techniques and materiel . A similar section “•	in the Philippine Army produCed- faulty ammunition and booby-

25 April 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY GILPATRIC
Fr.om: Brig. Gen. Lansdale—A
Few people outside Vietnam really know the man who was reelected President of the Republic of Vietnam earlier this month. With your new responsibilities towards Vietnam for Prcsident Kennedy, you might find it useful to have an insight about this
dedicated man drawn from my dose association with him. Also, you might like to pass this along to Vice President Johnson prior to his trip.
First of all, there is his name. Ngo Dinh Diem is pronounced as "No Din Zee'em. " lie is propcrly addressed as "President Ngo, " although most Americans, including myself, think of him as "Presi-
dent Diem. " The family name i
Diem is his given name and
it is customary for Victnamesc to be called by their given names. Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho is "Vice President Tho, " (pro-nounoed as "Tuh"). Secretary of State for -the Presidency Nguyen Dinh Thuan is "Mr. Thuan, " (pronounced as "Twan"). The use of "Prcsident Ngo" is a formal mark of respcct. Since I think of him as "Diem, " I will call him that to make-the remarks come easier.
<3
It takcs a perCeptive eye to see Diem’s true character when meeting him. Fie is short and round and "mild-spoken. " Many people miss his "snapping" black eyes by noting, instead, that his feet seem barely to reach the floor when he is seated. However he is not defensive about his short stature and is at ease around tall . Americans. He has a very positive approaCh to. Westerners, not the least bit Concerned about differences such as Asian-Caucasian background. When the Vice President secs him, he will find him as in-•tcrcstcd in Cattle as any Texan and as interested in freedom as Sam Houston.

At the- table, he shows that hc enjoys cating (and usually has a good appetite). His smile is shy and infrequent. Usually he is u	serious and becomes passionately so when, he talks about his true
love, Vietnam. Age lines show around his eyes, particularly on (	those mornings when he has stayed up most of the night reading,
which is often. He reads in English, French, and Vietnamese. While he speaks and understands English rather well, he is em-1 rrassed over his pronunciation and is reluctant to use it. In
I	his official contacts with Americans, he uses French.

Diem was born in Hue, the ancient capital in Central Vietnam, o.l 3 January 1901. His 60 years have been full of sharp tests of . his moral courage, of devotion to a highly-principlcd ideal of patriotism. This is worth understanding, particularly since the truth has been hidden by decades of "character assassination" by his bitterest enemies, the Communists and the French colonialists. Much false information has stuck, by sheer repetition. The truth is even more interesting.
« 1
For example, in the Spring of 1955 the Presidential Palace was under artillery fire from the Dinh Xuycn forres, who opened up on his bedroom wing with Sl-min. mortars at midnight. The French colons in the Saigon bars told a story with great glee of how Diem had hidden under his bed quivering with fear. What he 1	- actually did was typically different. He went out in his night-shirt
into the Palace grounds where some of the Guard Battalion had abandoned their artillery to take cover, and drove them baCk to r .	their guns with a tongue-lashing while paddling around the yard in
(	a pair of old slippers.
f	When someone desoribcs him as an aloof mandarin, 1 recall
.(	'	how he cried on my shoulder when our close friend, Trinh Minh The,
v/as killed, his anguish over thc loss of Phat Diem province in the North to the Communists, and the agony he went through in his final . break-with Chief of State Bao Dai., Ele-simply doesn’t parade his '	,
feelings for everyone to see, particularly when things are going wrong.
• President Diem has been criticized for his "family, " meaning primarily the influence of his younger brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu (pro-rnounCed as "No Din New"), and Madame Nhu. This younger brother J	*	■	■

handles many of the more sensitive political party and intclligence "speCial operations" for President Diem, as well as helping him privately with spcedlcs, planning, and family affairs. Some
• Americans have been strongly critical of brother Nhu, seeing in him a continuing influence towards a Diena dictatorial regime, with E	Control of the press, arrests of political dissenters, etc. Actually,
.	. brother Nhu-is a whole complex subject in himself, as is Madame
Nhu in herself. Both have been defamed maliciously. There is a r	grain of truth in some of the stories about them. But, the reality
is that Diem trusts Nhu for certain activities which he cannot entrust to anyone else, and needs him. We will hardly help Dicm be the strong leader we desire by insisting that he get rid of his trusted right-hand man; we would do better to influence that righthand man more effcctively. Incidentally, Madame Nhu is the daughter of Tran Van Chuong, the Vietnamese Ambassador in Washington.
The Ngo family needs mention further. Diem’s father was Grand Chamberlain of the old Imperial Court at Flue, in central Vietnam. He spent his life striving to maintain some semblance of Vietnamese rule under French control -- and brought up his sons to carry on the fight for eventual Vietnamese indepcndence. In
. effcct, it was a family organized for revolution. The sons arc:
/ ' . r	'	.
s	Ngo Dinh Khoi - killed by the Communists
Ngo Dinh Thue - ("Took") - Catholic Archbishop
Ngo Dinh Diem - President	...	,
Ngo Dinh Nhu - Presidential Adviser
Ngo Dinh Luyen - Ambassador in London
( .	Ngo Dinh Canh - At family home, Hue - in local politics there.
*
f .	.	In Vietnamese family style, each brother is responsible for his
□	next younger brother. Thus, Archbishop Thuc feels a heavy res-
ponsibility for President Diem (and is well-worth talking to about his brother’s problems), and President Diem feels a heavy responsibility .	for brother-Nhu.	.	(	•	.
Diem was educated at Hue, in the Vietnamese equivalent of legal training. Fie was the honor graduate of the last Government class

before the French stopped the training. Diem concentrated on tribal law, becominr, the outstanding expert on the subject through an.exhaustive study of all books and manuscripts in the Imperial library. His real bent was towards engineering, evidenced today in his love for mechanical gadgets and plans for public works. •
L
At 25, He was appointed as a Province Chief, and served from
■ 1926 to 1932 as such, governing Phan Rang and Phan Thiet in central Vietnam. At thc time, these provinCes had large French plantations which were practiCally feudal worlds into themselves. Diem, making use of tribal laws, opened lands for Vietnamese settlers. When workers started leaving plantations for land of their own, Diem beCame a hero among his people -- and earned some French hatred which still has remnants today.
Lt
During these same early years, Diem came up against the Corn-munists and started fighting them. The French brought in Chinese coolies from Singapore to build plantation railroads; the Chinese brought in Communist pamphlets and distributed them to Vietnamese plantation labor. Diem argued fordbly against this dangerous practice, but wasn’t heeded by the plantation owners. He then started working directly with the Vietnamese against Communist influence. (In other words, he has been actively up against all forms of Communist operations for 30 years now. )	'	•
r
In 1933, he had bccome such an outstanding leader among the Viet- . namesc that he was made Prime Minister. After 6 months in office, the French proposed government "reforms. " It adually meant the final form of Vietnamese abdication of all politiCal rights. Diem defied the French openly on this issue, finally resigned and returned all French honors (including their helpful remuneration). He became a real hero to the Vietnamese.
•....Thc family went through some hard times then. Diem’s father	(
was forced out of his position in 1940 for actions against the Communists,
. and- for returning tribal lands to the Vietnamese. They lived for a time ‘on the family farm, with Diem helping with plowing and chores. However, the family spent every spare moment working for Vietnamese freedom. Brother Nhu handled the funds. They fought a long, seoret war against both the French and the Communists.

. In 1950-53, Diem came to the U.S., staying at Maryknoll, N.J. He lectured at several U.S. universities, studied, tried-to interest Americans in helping Vietnam, and had a book published. The book was about thc meaning of democracy in Vietnam, pointing out similarities between U.S. and Victnamese "checks and balances" in government powers.	.
Diem then went to Belgium (where he met a number of German industrialists and engineers who impressed him). In 1954, as the Geneva Agreement was bringing a "cease fire" to the Franco-Vietminh War after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, Chicf.of State Bao Dai ' asked Diem to return to Vietnam to form a government. Fie arrived as half of his country was given away at Geneva and as French troops pulled back into smaller perimeters, abandoning the countryside to the Communist Vietminh.

r
I first met him when hc came to Saigon in 1954.- The situation for the free Vietnamese was disastrous, so I jotted down some sug-gcstions for vigorous aCtions by the new Prime Minister to start remedying the situation, had them approved by our Ambassador and MAAG Chief, and then went to the Palace and introduced myself. This • started a working relationship which gradually grew into one of trust - and respect, despite the faCt that such Vietnamese enernics as General Hinh (Chicf of Staff of the Vietnamese Army who plotted to overthrow Dicm) were friends of mine. Diem and'they knew that I, as an • American, was honestly trying to help bring unity and stability out of chaos to give the free Vietnamese a chance at life. I came to sce him almost daily as we moved refugees from thc Communist North, padficd the South as thc Communists withdrew regular forces, fought down a "rebellion by gangster sects, established government administration throughout the South, went through two serious coup attempts, brought the independent religious sect armies into the regular army, held a plebiscite to Choose a Chief of State, elected ’ a Constituent Assembly, and finally wrote a Constitution for the new country. They were 2-1/2 tough years, with plenty of give and take.
As the leader of a modern nation which has just bcen governing itself for 5 years, Diem has worked extremely long hours daily. For a long time, he was really the only competent executive in the govern-nient and had to cheok on infinite details of administration. Hc has a

phenomenal memory for details, dates, plaCes, and personal biographics -- and is short-tempered with Ministers who know less about the current work in their Dcpartments than he does. (U Nu of Burma shocked him once by not knowing the strength of the BurmeSC Army; Diem not only knows the strength and location of Vietnamese Armed Forces units, but also the names and family background of practically all the offioers). He now is starting to get a few competent executives. As he gets them, he gives them all the responsibility and authority needed to do the work. Few can stand the burden.
So, here is our toughest ally against Communism in Southeast Asia. A 60-year-old bachclor who gave up romance with his childhood sweetheart (she remains a spinster in Hue) to devote his life to his country. He is a person of immense moral courage and of demonstrated physical courage. He is intensely honest. And, despite sceing hundreds of people daily and visiting frequcntly all over the country, he is essentially a lonely man. He is hungry for the understanding friendship of responsible Americans.

Appraisal of the Situation: After a meeting in Hanoi on 13 May 1959, thc r~
(	Central Committee of the North Vietnamese Communist Party publicly
If ' announced its intention "to smash" the government of President Dieni. Following this decision, the Viet Cong have significantly incrcased their ■

program of infiltration, subversion, sabotage and assassination designed to achieve this end.
At the North Vietnamese Communist Party Congress in September, 1960, the earlier dcdaration of underground war by the Party's Control
1	Committee was re-affirmed. This action by the Party Congress took place
,	only a month after Kong Le’s coup in Laos. Scarcely two months later there

' ’ • .	■' Since that time, ‘as can-be seen from the attached map, the internal
L	security situation in South Vietnam has become critical. What amounts to
a state of active guerrilla warfare now exists throughout the country. The
number of Viet Cong hard-core Communists has increased from 4400 in

Casualties on both sidcs totalcd more than 4500 during the first three months of this year. 58% of the Country is under some, de.gre.e of Communist control, ranging from harassment and night raids to almost Complete administrative jurisdiction in thc Communist "secure areas."
Thc Viet Cong over the past two years have succecded in stepping up the pace and intensity of thcir attacks to thc point where South Vietnam is nearing the decisive phase in its battle for survival. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the Communists will be able to press on to thcir strategic goal of establishing a rival "National Liberation Front"
government in one of these "secure areas, " thereby plunging the nation ‘into open civil war. Thcy have publicly announced that they will "take over the country before thc end of 1961. "	-

munist subversion in South Vietnam has bccn the development of the Counter
Insurgency Plan. . This Plan, which has been fully.Coordinated within
thc U.S. government, has bccn fowarded to President Diem. Those
. portions of the Plan which arc agreed to by the G. V. N. will be implemented
as rapidly as possible.
As part of the over-all program, it is proposed that Vice Prcsident

Col. E. F. Black ■	28 April
EFFECT OF A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN LAOS ON THE PROPOSED PROGRAM OF ACTION FOR VIETNAM
If agreement is reached on a cease fire, political negotiations on the future of Laos will begin on May 12 at the Fourteen Power Conference in Geneva. However, the April 26th statement onLaos by the Chinese Communist indicates that the Communist members of that conference intend to expand the negotiations to include other areas of Southeast Asia. As a result, it can be expected that the Fourteen Power Conference will be prolonged, covering several months or more.
The effect of these negotiations on the Proposed Program of Action for Vietnam are threefold:
First, the very fact that the Fourteen Powers are meeting under essentially the same ground rules as the 1954 Geneva Accords, including the concept of an ICC mechanism in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, could have a politically inhibiting effect on any significant measures which the U.S. might undertake to prevent a Communist take-over in South Vietnam.
Second, as has been their practice in the past, the Communists can be expected to use the cover of an international negotiation to expand their subversive activities. In this case, close coordination SECRET 53
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 6,3316. By: NWD Date: 2011
of their efforts in southern Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam can be expected. The 250 mile border between South Vietnam and Laos, while never effectively sealed in the past, will now be deprived of even the semblance of protection which the friendly, pro-western Laos offers.
Third, the three principal passes through the Annamite Mountains (the Nape Pass, Mugia Gap, and Lao Bao Pass) lie in Southern Laos. These passes control three key military avenues of
| advance from North Vietnam through Laos into the open Mekong valley ' leading to Thailand and South Vietnam. A Lao political settlement that would afford the Communists an opportunity to maintain any sort of control, covertly or otherwise, of these mountain passes would make them gate keepers to the primary inland invasion route leading to Saigon and flanking the most important defensive terrain in the northern area of South Vietnam.
The first is of little significance since this government has already indicated that we will not consider ourselves bound by any limitations imposed by the 1954 Geneva Agreements.
As to the second, the neutralization or loss of Laos to the Free World will, of course, compound the problems which the G.V.N. faces in maintaining the security of their border with Laos. It will also improve the Communist capabilities to infiltrate personnel and equipment into Southern Vietnam through Cambodia. The extremely rugged nature of
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

• ■ . the terrain along the Laos-G.V.M. boundary makes it almost impossible to establish a "water-tight" border. However, this same rugged terrain limits the smuggling routes to one principal road, (the east-west highway
• from Savannahhet to Tchopone to Quang Tri) and to some 12-15 reasonably passable trails, with the reinforcement of the G. V. N. Army in .
the Konium plateau region; with the establishment of a thoroughly effective intelligence and patrol system using the most modern communications equipment; with regular aerial surveillance of the entire border region; and with the application of new technological area-denial techniques (e.g., GW, BW, ligh plastic, air-droppable landmines, fluorescent materials, etc.); it should be possible to hold the flow of Communist agents and supplies to the current levels. As these measures are applied the efficiency of the border patrol system can be expected to increase and it is not unreasonable to expect that the flow of Communist aid to the ;	Viet Cong might even be reduced somewhat.
The third, however, poses a direct and serious military threat to the entire western flank of South Vietnam. It cannot be met within the dimensions of our internal security program alone. It requires the prompt organization of two new G.V.N. divisions and a vastly accelerated U.S. training program for the entire G.V.N. army. This cannot be conceived of in terms of regular MAAG training, as its success depends upon raising the combat effectiveness of the South Vietnamese forces by an entire order
60 i

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
of magnitude within a matter of 6-8 months. To meet this new situation it will be necessary to augment the MAAG with two U.S. training commands, each capable of establishing a divisional field training area. One camp would be established in the vicinity of Kontum; the other, near Ban Me Thuot. Each of these training commands would require approximately 1600 U.S. soldiers drawn from Army or Marine Corps sources.
In addition to the regular divisional training program, a major step-up of Special Forces training is indicated to assist the G. V. N. forces counter the increased move level of Viet Cong guerrilla activity which can be expected to follow a cease fire in Laos. This will require a further MAAG augmentation of a Special Forces Group. To meet the urgency of the situation, the 1st Special Forces Group now stationed in Okinawa should be deployed at once to Nha Trang for this purpose.
In summary, the most effect of a political settlement in Laos, while complicating one important aspect of the problem of the defense of South Vietnam, will not make the over-all task impossible or even impracticable.
Specifically, force levels for the G. V. N. Army will have to be increased by two divisions; modern equipment, primarily of the communication and reconnaissance types, will have to be provided to assist the G. V. N. in setting up and operating an effective border control system; and the MAAG will have to be augmented by the addition of two U.S. divisional training commands (1,600 U.S. military personnel each) and one Special Forces Group (400 U.S. military personnel).	«

The Secretary observed that the principal change on the ground had been that forces had moved from such points as Muong Kassy and Tha Thom However, there had been no major change that would in itself make the difference between our carrying out Plan 5 today and three weeks ago.
Mr. McNamara said that the real question was whether we could land forces in Vientiane because of the danger of Chinese air retaliation local sabotage and the action by PL guerrillas who could move into Vientiane at any time. The Secretary observed that the presence of these guerrillas had been noted for weeks.
General Le May observed that there had been a large build-up of supplies by the Pathet Lao side.
Admiral Burke said that we were faced with the "folding" of the FAB, which was not fighting.
The Secretary asked to what extent we were influenced by the movement of Chinese Communist fighter bombers and pointed out that this capability certainly existed three weeks ago.

When the Secretary asked whether wo could send in troops to secure the airfield, Admiral Burke said that would be a first task. Mr. FlcMamara said it would be easy for the enemy to deny us the airfield as we would need thirty-six sorties a day to get US troops into Vientiane.	| 1

Mr. Steeves pointed out that we had always argued that we would not give up Laos and that it was on the pleas of our military that we had supported Phoumi; that we had reiterated in the press and to the public what Laos meant to us. If this problem is unsolvable then the problem of Viet-Nam would be unsolvable. If we decided that this was untenable then we were writing the first chapter in the defeat of Southeast Asia. Mr. McNamara said the situation was not as bad five weeks ago as it was now.
Admiral Burke pointed out that each time you giv. ground it is harder to stand next time. If we give up Laos we would have to put US forces into Viet-Nam and Thailand, we would have to throw enough in to win—perhaps the "works". It would be easier to hold now than later. The thing to do was to land now and hold as much as we can and make clear that we were not going to be pushed out of Southeast Asia. We were fighting for the rest of Asia.
Mr. McNamara wondered whether more VietCong would necessarily enter South Viet-Nam if Laos went down the drain. He mentioned that some 12,000 Viet Cong had entered South Viet-Nam under present conditions and that the Communists held the area south of the 17th Parallel to a depth of twenty-five miles with a supposedly friendly government in South Viet-Nam. (Several of those present questioned	•
the accuracy of the figure of 12,000.)
Turning to the question of the morale of the Southeast Asians, the Secretary recalled that the Thai Foreign Minister had told him during the recent SEATO conference that Thailand was like a "golden bell" which had to be protected from outside. The Secretary said he was not sure the Foreign Minister was wrong. He added that he was less worried about escalation than he was about infectious slackness. He said he would not give a cent for what the Persians would think of us if we did not defend Laos.	__
General Decker thought that we should have stood last August and wondered what would happen if we got "licked". The Secretary suggested that Thai and US troops might be placed together in Vientiene and, if they could not hold, be removed by helicopter. Even if they were defeated they would be defeated together and this would be better than sitting back and doing nothing. General Decker said we cannot win a conventional war in Southeast Asia; if we go in, we should go in to win, and that means bombing Hanoi, China, and maybe even using nuclear bombs. He pointed out that all the advantage we have in he'avy equipment would be lost in the difficult terrain of Laos where we would be at the mercy of the querrillas. The Secretary pointed out that this fact was also true at the time of the Bangkok Resolution but that we had gone ahead with the resolution anyway and had issued statements indicating that we would

would back up our words with deeds. Mr. McNamara repeated that the situation is now worse than it was five weeks ago. Mr. Steeves pointed out that the same problems existed in South Viet-Nam, but Admiral Burke thought that South Viet-Nam could be more easily
controlled.
General Becker then suggested that troops be moved into Thailand and South Viet-Nam to see whether such action would not produce a cease-fire. Admiral Burke asked what happens if there is still no cease-fire. General Decker said then we would be ready to go ahead.
Mr. Kennedy said we would look sillier than we du now if we got troops in there and then backed down. He reiterated the question whether we are ready to go the distance.
The Secretary said that we would want to get the United Nations "mixed up" in this.
Mr. Behlen said he saw no need for a fixation on the possibility of a reaction by the Chinese Communists. He said we had no evidence that they want to face the brink of nuclear war. He said that he was more concerned about the objectives we would seek if we took military action.
There followed a discussion about the possibility of restoring the kingdom of Champassak where Boun Oum relinquished the throne and where he is popular. It was thought that Sihanouk would support a partition of Laos. General Decker thought that if a cease-fire could be effected now, it would be possible to secure southern Laos.
General Le May did not believe that it would be possible to get a cease-fire without military action. He admitted that he did not know what US policy is in Laos. He knew what the President had said but he also pointed out that the military had been unable to back up the President’s statements. He then enumerated a number of possibilities: 1) do nothing and lose Laos; 2) yse B-26’s and slow up the enemy; 3) use more sophisticated bombers and stop supplies and then perhaps Phoumi's forces could be brought up to where they could fight; 4) implement Plan 5, backing up troops with air. General Le May did not think the Chinese would escalate but believed on the contrary that a cease-fire would then be brought about. He added that he believed we should go to work on China itself and let Chiang take Hainan Island. He thought Chiang had a good air force.

General Shoup suggested that B-26’s should be used before troops are landed. He felt that it might then be possible to obtain a cease-fire and get the panhandle of Laos. Mr. Kennedy asked if any appreciable dent could be made on the guerrillas with B-26's. General Le May said it would be possible to knock out a big wad of supplies with B-26’s and 100's. Mr. Kennedy asked what would be the next step. The Secretary said it would be necessary to get the UN in quickly. Mr. Kennedy asked what the others would do then. General Le May said the worst that could happen would be that the Chinese Communists would come in. Mr. Kennedy asked if it could all be done by air. General Le May said it could. Mr. McNamara said you would have to use nuclear weapons. Mr. Kennedy asked if South Viet-Nam and Thailand could be held if Laos • were lost. The Secretary and Admiral Burke agreed that it would take a greater effort to hold them after Laos had been lost and Mr. Johnson pointed out that Thailand had to be defended from the other bank.
Mr. Steeves felt that the prize to be focused on was Southeast Asia. The question to be faced, he thought, was whether we could afford to lose Southeast Asia.
The Secretary thought that if a cease-fire is not brought about quickly, then it would be necessary to get the UN to come in with the SEATO forces committed in a Plan 5 action. He thought that a majority could be found in the UN for such action if the cost is not distributed. Mr. McNamara and Admiral Burke thought that more than two weeks would be required for UN action. Admiral Burke said that only the United States could pull its own chestnuts out of the fire. (There followed a general discussion on the extent to which others would support us. It was agreed that the Pakistani could be relied upon if we paid for them and that a few Malays, New Zealanders and others would help.)
Ambassador Young suggested the possibility of training 50 to 60,000 Vietnamese. He pointed to the ready access to ports in the area of the Lao border and to the fact that the terrain in the area is not too bad.
Mr. Bowles said he thought the main question to be faced was the fact that we were going to have to fight the Chinese anyway in 2, 3, 5 or 10 years and that it was just a question of where, when and how. He thought that a major war would be difficult to avoid. General Le May said that, in that case, we should fight soon since the Chinese would have nuclear weapons within one or two years.
Mr. McNamara said that the situation was worsening by the hour and that if we were going to commit ourselves, then we must do so sooner rather than later.
The Secretary then adjourned the meeting saying he would like to consider the matter further.

To Prevent Communist Domination of South Vietnam
	.		
Appraisal of the Situation: The internal security situation in
	South Vietnam has become critical, as can be seen on the attached
map, with an estimated 12, 000 Viet Cong Communists waging

guerrilla warfare inside the country. The strongly anti-Communi st, pro-AmeriCan government of South Vietnam, with American aid, is
inCreasing its capabilities to fight its attackers. Should the Com-	•
munist effort increase, either directly or as a result of a Collapse 	of Laos, additional measures beyond those proposed herein may be
				
necessary. (Details in Annex 1. )
		 The U.S. Objcctive: To prevent Communist domination of South
Vietnam and to create in that country a viable and increasingly
		
democratic society. 
			
	Concept of Operations: To initiate, on an accelerated basis, a
series of mutually supporting actions of a military, political, economic, psychological and covert character designed to achieve this objective. In so doing, it is intended to use, and where appropriate extend,
expedite or build upon the existing U.S. and Government of Vietnam

(G. V. N. ) programs, including as much of the Countcr-Insurgency
Plan (CIP), as can.be agrecd by both governments, already uncler-
way in South .Vietnam. There is neither the time available nor any
sound justification for "starting from scratch. " Rather the need is
to focus the U. S. effort in South Vietnam on the iinmcdiate internal
e unity problem; to infuse it with a sense of urgency and a dedica
tion to the overall U.S. objeotive; to achieve, through Cooperative
inter-departmental support both in the field and in Washington, the
operational flexibility needed to apply the available U. S. assets in
a manner best calculated to achieve our objeCtive in Vietnam; to
give the U.S. Ambassador and the U.S. team under his leadership
general authority to undertake a series of accelerated measures
as noted bclow; and finally, to impress on our friends, the Viet
namese, and on our foes, the Communists, that come what may,
the U.S. intends to win this battle.
Program of Action:
1. General: The situation in South Vietnam has reached
•the .point 'where., 'at least for the time being, primary emphasis must
be placed on providing a solution to the internal seCurity problem.
A significant step which has already been taken by the Country Team
to counter Communist subversion in South Vietnam, has becn the
development of the Counter-Insurgency Plan (CIP). Those portions
L.
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 201 I
of the CIP which are agreed to by the G. V.N. will be implemented
as rapidly as possible.
Communist domination of South
Vietnam needs more than mili-
tary measures alonc to be stopped.
Our military program must be
acCornpanied and supplemented by a
strong, positive political-
1.
economiC program.
2. Military:
a. The following military actions were approved by
the President at thc NSC meeting of 29 April 1961:
(1) Increase the MAAG as necessary to insure the
effeotive implementation of the military portion of the program in-
cluding the training of a 20, 000-man addition to the present G. V. N.
armed forces of 150, 000. Initial appraisal- of new tasks assigned
CHMA_AG indicate that approximately 100 additional military person-
nel will be rcquired immediately in addition to thc present complement
of 685.- •
(2)0 Expand MAAG responsibilities to include
• authority to-provide support and advice to the Self Defense Corps
with a strength of approximately 40, 000.
(3) Authorize MAP support for the entire Civil
Guard force of 68,000. MAP support is now authorized for 32, 000;
the remaining 36,000 are not now adequately trained and equipped.

(4)	Install as a matter of priority a radar sur-
vcillance capability which will enable the G. V.N. to obtain warning of Communist over-flights being conducted for intelligence or clandestine air supply purposes. Initially, this capability should be provided from U.S. mobile radar capability.
(5)	Provide MAP support for the Vietnamese
Junk Force as a means of preventing Viet Cong clandestine supply and infiltration into South Vietnam by water. MAP support, which
r:
was not provided in the Counter-Insurgency Plan, will include train-
ing of junk crews in Victnam or at U. S. bases by U. S. Navy personnel.
b. The following additional actions are considered neces-
sary to assist the G. V.N. in meeting the increased security threat
resulting from thc new situation along the Laos-G, V.N. frontier:
(1)	Assist the G. V. N. armed forces to increase
thcir border patrol and insurgency suppression capabilities by establishing an effective border intelligenCe and patrol system, by instituting regular aerial surveillance over the entire frontier area, and by applying modern technologiCal area-denial techniques to Control the roads and trails along Vietnam's borders. A speCial staff element (approximately 6 U.S. personnel), to concentrate upon solutions to the unique problems of Vietnam's borders, will be activated in MAAG, Vietnam, to a.ssist a similar special unit in the RVNAF which the
73

G. V.N. will be encouraged to establish; thesc two elements working
।	as an integrated team will help the G. V.N. gain the support of nomadic
tribes and other border inhabitants, as well as introduce advanCed
,.	techniques and equipment to strengthen the security of South Vietnam’s
j	frontiers.
(2)	Assist the G. V.N. to establish a Combat Develop-r
<	ment and Test Center in South Victnam to develop, with the help of
modern technology, new techniques for use against the Viet Cong
forces. (Approximately 4 U. S. personnel.)
T
(3)	Assist the G. V. N. forces with health, wclfare
and public work projects by providing U.S. Army civic action mobile
L»
training teams, coordinated with the similar civilian effort. (Approxi-
□	matcly 14 U. S. personnel. )	*	....
(4)	Deploy a Special Forces Group (approximately
.	400 personnel) to Nha Trang in order to accelerate G. V.N. Special
Forces training. The first increment, for immediate deployment to
r
Victnam, should be a Special Forces company (52 personnel).
p	(5) Instruct JCS, CINCPAC, and MAAG to undertake
an assessment of the military utility of a further increase in the G. V.N. r
forces from 170, 000 to 200, 000 in order to create two new division
।	equivalents for deployment to the northwest border rcgion. The
parallel political and fisoal impliCations should be assessed.

> In preparation for possible commitment of U. S. force
to Vietnam, which might result from an NSC decision following discus
sions between Vice President Johnson and President Diem, Defense is
undertaking an immediate study of the size and composition of U.S.
forces required to:
- provide maximum psychological impact in deterrence
of further Communist aggression from North Victnam, China, or the
Soviet Union, while rallying the morale of the Victnamese and enCourag
ing the support of SEATO and neutral nations for Vietnam’s defense;
- release Vietnamese forces from advanced and static
defense positions to permit their fuller commitment to counter-insurgency
actions;
- provide maximum training to approved Vietnamese
forCes; and
- provide significant military resistance to potential
. North Vietnam C.ommunist and/or Chinese Communist aCtion.
The following.possible aCtions are being considered in this Defense
study:
(1)	Deploy to South Vietnam two U.S. battle groups
(with necessary Command and logistics units), plus an engineer (con-

which will create a solid and widespread support among the key political
group and the general population for a Vietnam whiCh has the will to

resist Communist encroachment and which in turn stems from a stake
in a fleer and more democratic society. ■
a.	Increase the confidenCe of President Diem and his
government in the United States, by the following aCtions:
(1)	A message has been dispatched to President
Diem informing him of your personal support for his courageous leader-
ship in the struggle against communism and of Vioe Prcsident Johnson's

trip, indicating that Vice President Johnson will be Carrying a more
detailed expression of your thoughts on a broad range of proposals for

prepared for Vice Prcsident Johnson identifying the key objectives con-
tained in this Task Force report which we propose as a joint U.S, -
’ Vietnamese address to the existing threat to Vietnam’s freedom, stability
and security, seeking an expression of Diem’s support for this joint effort.
(3)	Vice President Johnson’s trip to Vietnam should
bc focused on obtaining broad agreement on how the U. S. and Vietnam

b.	Strengthen President Diem’s popular support
within Vietnam, by the following actions:
(1)	Instruct Ambassador Nolting to reappraise
the political situation and undertake to obtain agreement of the G. V.N.
on an urgent basis for a realistic political program along the lines
indicated in the CIP. The objective of the program would be to seek
to produce favorable attitudes and active popular cooperation against
the VC. While the Ambassador’s recommendations might well include *
adions directed toward fiscal and monetary reform measures, it is
presumed that the major recommendations in this area will be developed
by the Ambassador in conjunction with the special team of U.S. economic
l experts which it is proposed be dispatched to Vietnam for this purpose
(in Econornic .section following).
(2)	As a part of this initial assessment, the
Ambassador should also consider such special arrangements within the field organization as he may deem required to assure a capability for rapid Country Team response to evolving problems. This should include an assessment of staff requirements, both with a view to requesting such additional personnel as required and to reviewing the employment

ANNEX 1
Appraisal of the Situation
After a meeting in Hanoi on 13 May 1959, the Central Committee
of the North Vietnamese Communist Party publicly announced its
Ci
intention "to smash” the government of President Ngo Dinh Diem. Following this decision, the Viet Cong have significantly increased thcir program of infiltration, subversion, sabotage and assassination designed to adlieve this end.
At the North Vietnamese Communist Party Congress in September, 1960, thc earlier declaration of underground war by the Party’s Control
Committee was rc-affirmed. This action by thc Party Congrcss took place only a month after Kong Le's Coup in Laos. Scarcely two months later there was a military uprising in Saigon. The turmoil created throughout the area by this rapid succession of events provides an ideal environment for the Communist "master plan" to take over all of Southeast Asia.
Since that time, as can be seen from the attached map, the internal security situation in South Vietnam has become critical. What amounts
to a state of active guerrilla warfare now exists throughout the country.
Despite greatly stepped up efforts by South Vietnamese, the number of
Vict Cong hard-core Communists has increased from 4400 in early

1960 to an estimated 12,000 today. The number of violent incidents per •month now averages 650; casualties on both sides totaled more than 4500 during the first three months of this year. These figures, while alarming, are also a reflection of inCreased efforts by South Vietnamese forces. 58% of thc Country is under some dcgrec of Communist control,
ranging from harrassment and night raids to almost complete administra
Ci
tive jurisdiction in the Communist "secure areas. "
The Viet Cong over the past two years have succeeded in stepping up the pace and intensity of their attaoks to the point where South Vietnam is nearing the decisive phase in its battle for survival. If the situation
Continues to dcteriorate, the Communists will be able to press on to their strategic goal of establishing a rival "National Liberation Front"
government in one of these "secure areas, " thereby plunging the nation into open civil war. They have publicly announced that they will "take over the country before the end of 1961. "
If agreement is reached on a cease fire in Laos, political ncgotia-ti'ons on the future of that country will begin on May 12 at the Fourteen Power Conference in Geneva, However, the April 26 statement on Laos
by the Peiping government indicates that the Communist members of that conference intend to expand the negotiations to include other areas of Southeast Asia. As a result, it Can be expected that the Fourteen Power

meeting will be prolonged, covering scvcral months or more. 0—

The effcct of these negotiations on the situation in Victnam will be threefold:	.
First, the very fact that the Fourteen Powers arc meeting under essentially the same ground rules as the 1954 Geneva Accords, including the concept of an ICC mechanism in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, could have a politically inhibiting effeCt on any significant measures which the U.S. might undertake to prevent a Communist take-over in South Vietnam.
SeCond, as has been their practice in the past, the Communists can be expected to use the cover of an international negotiation to expand thcir. subversive aCtivities. In this case, close Coordination of their efforts in Southern Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam Can be expected. The 250 mile border between South Vietnam and Laos, while never effectively scaled in the past, will now be deprived of even the semblance of protection which the friendly, pro-western Laos offers.	•
Third, the three principal passes through the Annamite Mountains -the Nape Pass, Mugia Gap, and the pass that controls the road from Quang Tri to Savanakhet - lie in Southern Laos. These passes control three key military avenues of advanCe from North Vietnam through Laos '••••• _ • • ♦ * . - ■ • * into the opening Mckong valley, leading to Thailand and South Vietnam.
A Lao political settlement that would afford the Communists an opportunity to maintain any sort of control, covertly or otherwise, of these mountain passes would make them gatc keepers to the primary inland invasion

route loading to Saigon and flanking the most important defensive
terrain in the northern area of South Vietnam.
Thus, the situation is critical but not hopeless. The South
Vietnamese Governmcnt, with American aid, is increasing its capa-
bilities to fight its attackers. It provides a strong anti-Communi st
government and generally pro-American population as a base upon
which the necessary additional effort can be founded to defeat the
Communist attack. Should the Communist effort increase, either
directly or as a result of a collapse of Laos, additional measures
may be necessary.

1.	The military considerations involved in a national program of actic 1 designed to prevent Communist domination of South Vietnam and to create in that country a viable, increasingly democratic society are com-plicc _ed by:
‘ .j .	.	.	.
a.	The Post Cease-fire Situation in Laos:
Indications are that the Communists are attempting to use the post cease-fire period to consolidate their control over the areas in which the Pathct Lao forces have been operating. If they are successful, this will
(1)	Greatly increase the problem of guarding thc G.V.N. -Laos border against the infiltration of Communist terrorists and supplies, and
(2)	Allow the Communists to gain control over the three principal passes through the Annamite Mountains, which lie along the frontier between Vietnam and Laos. These passes (The Nape Pass, Mugia Gap, and
‘	. pa’ss that controls the road from Quang Tri to Savannakhet; are located
in Southern Laos and control the three key military avenues of advance flom North Vietnam through Laos into the open Mekong Valley leading to Thailand and South Vietnam. Ability to use these internal lines of advance would enable an attacker from the North to avoid thc coastal road which is vulnerable to interdiction by naval gunfire or demolitions and to flank the most defensive terrain in the northern area of South Vietnam.

b.	The Forthcoming Fourteen-Power Conference:
The very fact that the Fourteen Powers are meeting under essentially the same ground rules as the 1954 Geneva Agreements, including the concept of an ICC mechanism in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, could have a politically inhibiting effect on any significant measures which the U.S. might undertake to prevent a Communist take-over in South Vietnam. I
c.	SEATO Responsibilities under thc Manila Paot:
Responsibility for the defense of South Victnam, both against external aggression and internal subversion, was assumcd by the SEATO powers under the protocol to the Manila Pact. The unanimity principle governing SEATO action has prevented that organization from taking any measures to resist Communist advances to date. Yet the very existence of SEATO makes it politically desirable that any military operations in Southeast Asia be conducted under its aegis. This in turn inhibits, to a * * ... • certain degree, U.S. unilateral military actions.
d.	The Morale Problem within South Vietnam:
a i	The failure of SEATO to take any action to .halt the Communist
! actions in Laos has in large measure impaired the credibility of that

organization insofar.as providing collective assistanCe in the.defense of
any nation in the area. Similarly, the U.S. reluctance to play a more active leadership role in SEATO has also Contributed to a general lowering
i of morale among the G.V.N. governmental officials and intelligentsia.
Meanwhile the Communist terrorist campaign has been stepped up, thereby . o -r

। increasing the sense of unCertainty and fear throughout the official govern-
I mcnt of South Vietnam.	.
2.	Taking these military considerations into account, the problem of preventing Communist domination of South Vietnam can be broken down into:
a.	Internal Security Mcasures:
These have been carefully worked out and coordinated within the U.S. Government in the form of a counter-insurgency pl'n (CIP) for Vietnam. This plan has been presented to Prcsident Diem and is to be implemented as rapidly as possible as he approvcs the various specific elements of the plan. In support of the CIP, the President at the NSC Meeting of 29 April 1961 approved the actions listed under Part I of the Military Section of the proposed Program.
b.	Protection of the Land Border of South Vietnam:
Communist capabilities to infiltrate personnel and equipment into South Vietnam across either the Lao or the Cambodia border will be facilitated by the cover provided by the cease-fire and the forthcoming Fourteen-Power Conference. Along the Laos-G. V. N. boundary, the extremely rugged nature of the terrain makes it almost impossible to * • . * • • . • • .. establish a "water-tight" border. However, this same rugged terrain limits the smuggling routes to one principal road, (the east-west highway . from Savannakhet to Tchepone to Quang Tri) and to some 12-15 reasonably passable trails.

Barring a significant increase in the present level of guerrilla
infiltration and military aggression, the G.V.N. armed forces (170,000)
and the Civil Guard (68, 000) bolstered by the establishment of an effective
intelligence and patrol system, regular aerial border surveillance and the
application of technological area-dcnial techniques (e.g., CW, BW, light
plastic, air-droppable landmines, fluorescent materials, etc.), have the
capability of Continuing the suppression of .the insurgency and even making
considerable headway against it. This capability will, of course, dcpcnd
on a major acceleration of the present retraining program. Given the aug-
mentation and strengthening of the G.V.N. armcd forces now being proposed,
it is considered an acceptable military risk that South Vietnam can cope
successfully with thc Laos border problem.
Similar considerations apply to the frontier between South
Victnam and Cambodia.
It is hoped, however, that a realization of the
increased threat to their
own security posed by Communist advances into
J.cos would persuade the
G.V.N. and Cambodia Governments to cooperate
more effectively in the maintenance of adequate border security between
the two Countries
In furtherance of these efforts, a special staff element (approxi-
mately 6 U.S. personnel), to concentrate upon solutions to the unique prob-
of Vietnam's broders, will be activated in MAAG, Vietnam, to assist
a similar special unit in the RVNAF which the G.V.N. will be encouraged

warfare now being waged throughout Southeast Asia, taking into account
particularly thc local terrain, the Icvel of training of the Vietnamese population, and the possibilities of local production of any new weapons or equipment which may be developed.	’
c.	Protection Against Infiltration by Sea:
The provision of MAP support for the Vietnamese Junk Force f (tflrea’dy approved by the Prcsident) will greatly improve that Force's capabilities in preventing clandestine supply and infiltration from the s'ca. Additionally, however, it v/ill be necessary for CINCPACs naval . component to assume an active responsibility jointly with the Vietnamese navy for coastal patrol aCtivities from the Cambodian border to the mouth of the Mekong River.

supplies and personnel Currently reaching the southern delta area of Vietnam.
d.	Training the G.V.N. Armed Forces for Combat:
The changed military situation in South Vietnam resulting from
the Communist successes in Laos poses a direCt and serious military threat
to the entire western flank of South Vietnam which Cannot be met within the
dimensions of our internal security program alone. This new threat requires
the prompt organization of two new G.V.N. divisions and a vastly accelerated
r
U.S. training program for the entire G.V.N. army. Because of the shortage
of trained officers and non-commissioned officers cadres, the success of
such a program depends upon raising the combat effectivencss of the South

months. To meet this new situation, it will be necessary to process the
entire G.V.N. army through a greatly intensified divisional training pro-
gram as rapidly as possible. A task of this magnitude is wcll beyond the
capabilities of the existing MAAG and will require the augmentation of the
U.S. Advisory Group with as much as two U.S. training commands, each
capable of establishing a divisional field training area in the "high plateau

area of South Vietnam. These training areas, established in remote location
away from population centers and organized on a completely austere basis, •

simulating to the maximum extent combat conditions in the Country, would
each be able to process an entire G.V.N. division every ten weeks.

U.S. personnel required to establish these training commands would be introduced into South Vietnam in phased increments through northern ports, such as- Tourane and Nha Trang in a manner calculated to minimize, as much as possible, public attention to these MAAG augmentations. Preliminary estimates indicate that in order to process the existing 7 Viet-namcsc divisions through this intensified combat training program in the short time available, each of these U.S. training commands would require approximately 1600 U.S. instructors from Army or Marine Corps sources.
In addition to thc regular divisional training program, an acceleration of Special Forces training is indicated to assist the G.V.N. forces counter the incrcascd level of Viet Cong guerrilla activity which can be expected to follow a cease-fire in Laog. This will require a furthcr MAAG augmentation • of a Spccial Forces Group. To meet the urgency of the situation, a Special Forces Group (approximately 400 military personnel) should be deploycd at phascd increments to Nha Trang for this purpose. Initially a Special Forces Company (52 personnel) would be sent at once to prepare for the arrival of the remainder of the Group.	..

3. Inoreasing the confidence of President Diem and his government

Vietnam. Fortunately a number of circumstances are favorable; a new administration in the United States, a new ambassador going to Vietnam, and the fact that President Diem has received a new mandate. Ncvcrthcless, the going will not be easy. Given Diem's personality and charactcr and the

5. The Vice President's visit will provide the 'added incentive needed to give the GVN the motivation and confidence it needs to carry on the struggle. We believe that meetings between the Vice President and President Diem will act as a catalytic agent to produce broad agreement I	-
on he need for accelerated joint Vietnamese-US actions to resist Communist encroachment in S.E. Asia. These meetings will also serve to get across to President Diem our confidence in him as man of great stature and as one of the strong figures in S.E. Asia on whom we are placing our reliance.z At the same time, these conferences should impress Diem with the degree of importance we attach to certain political and economic reforms in Vietnam which are an essential element in frustrating Communist encroachments. Recognizing the diffiCulties we have had in the past in persuading Diem to take effcctive action on such reforms, as specific an understanding as possible should be soliCited from Diem on this point, . Finally it might be possible for the Vice President to return to Washington with a letter from Diem to the President replying to thc letter rcferred to in Paragraph c4_ above.	. .

autocratic methods and his lack of communication with the Vietnamese people are a continuing cause of concern.
7, The chief threat to the viability of President Diem's administration is, without a doubt, the fact of Communist insurgency and the government's inal lity to protect its own people. Thus military measures must have the highest priority. There is , nevertheless, strong discontent with the
T
government among not only the elite but among peasants, labor and business. Criticism focuses on thc dynastic aspects of the Diem rule, on ■
its clandestine political apparatus and on the methods through which the
President exercises his leadership. This is aggravated by Communist subversive attempts to discredit the President and weaken his government's authority. All this is made the easier because of a communication void existing between the government and the pcople. For many months United States efforts have been directed toward persuading Diem to adopt
, .	! f olitical, social, and economic changes designed to Correct this serious
.p	defect. Many of these changes are included in the Counter-Insurgency

cooperation with Cambodia on border control. This.will require a major effort of reconciliation. Other free world countries should be asked to assist or at least support Vietnam in its struggle. Vietnam is a Free World problem, not just a Unitcd States problem.
11	Cooperation between Cambodia and Vietnam on border (control is an essential means of combating the Communists. Vietnam and Cambodia have always had difficulty in negotiation on any issue, I
espccially a complex and politically-charged problem like bordercontrol. In 1960, Cambodia made a major request for military assistance to which we made only a token response. We should endeavor to obtain better Cambodian cooperation, using a step up of military assistance as "quid pro quo. " To maximize the benefit to be dcrived from provision of additional military assistance we should specifically agree' to provide 4 jet trainers requcsted by the Cambodians thereby precluding provision of these aircraft by Czechoslovakia which has already offered to make the aircraft available to thc Cambodians. This would forestall further Communist pcnetration in this area.

Vietnam. The Soviets would probably veto any such action, and action in the General Assembly would be required. Not only does the provision of United Nations Observers have intrinsic merit but in any event, United Nations consideration would have the value of focusing world opinion on Communist actions in Vietnam.
13.	An appeal by Vietnam to the United Nations for the dispatch of ground observers to supplement the work of the ICC in patrolling against
the infiltration of arms and armed personnel into Vietnam would normally be Health with first in the Security Council and, if a veto by a permanent member prevented the Security Council from acting the appeal could then be taken up by the Gcneral Assembly. There are various reasons for concluding that such an appeal ought to bc dealth with first in the Security Council rather than in thc General Assembly:
(a)	The Seourity Council, under Article 24, has primary responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. .	'	'	’	' '	•’	•

meet resistance in the General Assembly, perhaps led by such permanent members of the Security Council as France and the Soviet Union.
(d)	Proceedings in the Council are more manageable, and it would be relatively easier to secure majority agreement on a satisfactory text. If the USSR should veto, this sann text could then be introduced in the Assembly, with probable avoida.nce of a difficult many-powered negotiation. 14. A resolution providing for the dispatch of a United Nations observer group would be likely to receive the support of seven or more members of the Security Council. Nevertheless, its passage could be prevented by the negative vote of one of the permanent members of thc Council. The Soviet Union would bc likely to veto such a resolution. Then the processes of the General Assembly could be invoked to deal with the question, pursuant to the Uniting for Peace Resolution. Action in the Assembly would presumably be undertaken on the basis of thc draft resblution which failed of adoption in the Security Council. Under Article 18 (2) of the Charter, questions involving recommendations with respcct to the maintenance of peace and security are important questions requiring a two-thirds majority of the m.embcrs present and voting in the General Assembly. In thc case of a request by Vietnam for United Nations observers, such a majority could probably be secured in support of a.resolution providing for the
I dispatch of a United Nations Observer Group.

Infiltration would be exposed to a much greater extent than is now the r .	'
case and hence might be deterred; South Vietnam would be strengthened by the presence of United Nations observers. The prcstige and political

offered 1 to provide training personnel with years of experience in Malay.
It has also offered financial support. Other like-minded countries, notably , the Philippines, and Australia have a capability and a possible ,	interest in this regard. While the use of third country personnel may
create some administrative problems for us and the GVN. it is of overriding importance that others share with us the responsibility for (	.	helping Vietnam win its struggle. Particularly as we can obtain a
British participation we will maximize the political benefits to be obtained within the western alliance by sharing responsibility for this diffioult problem.	.

Civic Action
17.	The anti-guerrilla effort should be accompanied and followcd up
by economic and political consolidation. A broad range of community
development activities both in the politicaland economic field should
c
be pressed forward. Not only should roads, wells, schools, etc., be
pushed forward, but village political councils should be created and an
imaginative communications system should be established, geared to
bring the rural people of Vietnam into the body politic.
Improved Sccurity Arrangements
18.	It is doubtful whether the Vietnamese government could weather
the pressure which would be generated if Laos were lost, without
prompt and dramatic support for its security from the U.S. Similarly,
the extent to which thc remainder of the S.E. Asian countries would be
prepared to go "in resisting Bloc pressures or in withstanding local
Communist threats would depend on whether they still assessed that
the U.S. could stem further Communist expansion in the area. Although
they would bo disillusioned regarding U.S. resolution after the loss or 1
division of Laos, they would nonetheless welcome demonstrations of U.S.
firmness, ald might, in response, modify their appraisal of their own
future in due course. " (NIE of March 28, Outlook in Mainland S.E. Asia).

continuous violation of these provisions of the Gcneva Accords by
North Vietnam in introducing large numbers of armed guerrillas
into South Vietnam would justify the corresponding non-observance
oi hese provisions by South Vietnam. Indeed, authorization for.-
changing PEO Laos onto an ordinary MAAG was justified on this
legal theory. It should be recognized that the foregoing proposals
require careful and detailed consideration and preparation particularly
with
regard to the .precise mission of U.S. forces used.

In addition to the previously cited advantages such an action might
1
have
at least two other important political and military advantages:
(a) It could release a portion of the ARVN from relatively static
military functions to pursue the war against the insurgents and
(b) It would place the Sino-Soviet Bloc in the position of risking
direct intervention in a situation where U.S. forces were already in
place, accepting the conscquense. of such action. This is in direct
contrast to the current situation in Laos.
22. Alternatively, there are several potential political and military
disadvantages to such an action, principal among these being:
(a) Some of the neutrals, notably India might well be opposed -
the-attitude: of the U.K. and France is uncertain.
(b) This would provide the Communists with a major propaganda
opportunity.

Best Uge of Resources
1.	Our capability to assist Vietnam is hampered by its own inability to make the best use of its available resources. A broad range of agreement between our governments on fiscal and monetary measures to correct this situation is urgently needed.
2.	In spite of the increased insurgency, Vietnam has been making good economic progress. It has increased production and its exports have been increasing rapidly. Despite a steady decrease in economic aid, its foreign exchange reserves have been going up and are now in excess of its normal needs. On the other hand, GVN revenues are now inadequate, in GVN opinion, to meet the increased local Currency costs of furthcr anti-insurgency measures. This presents the US with a difficult delimma. On the one hand, the enthusiastic cooperation of the GVN in moving forward against the Communists is essential, but on the other hand, if we give in to their request for more aid in support • • •• s • • •. . ■ •
of the military budget, this might not only fail to produce additional local currency, but could provide a serious disincentive to GVN efforts to find more resources. More importantly, coming after a protracted

which has recently gained a limited Vietnamese agreement (the
Vietnamese have agreed to meet the FY 61 local currency costs of
the CIP) a relaxation, in our previous position might well be inter-
preted as an acoeptanCe by the US that the problem is of greater concern to it than to Vietnam. Such an attitude could be highly disruptive to an effective joint US-Vietnamese effort. They have the means to raise more revenue, including increased taxation and
monctary reform, but both of these solutions, particularly the latter, arc unpalatable in the extreme-to President Diem. However, one
thing is certain, payment of Vietnamese troops will receive first priority in the Vietnamese budget and US failure to provide additional defense support aid will not affect the ability or willingness of Vietnam f to carry out necessary military actions.
3.	Vietnam is essentially, a "have" rather than a "have not” country. It has land, resources, and an ahleand. energetic people. If it were not for the Communists, Vietnam -would probably be, like Thailand,
‘ economically viable tc-day. We should help it move ahead with a long range development program against the day when the Communist menace has been brought under Control and it can press ahead into an era of

4.	Perhaps the most effective means of establishing Vietnaiinese confidence in the political and economic future of their country would be for the US to commit itself to a long range economic development program. Under peaaeful circumstances, Vietnam would unquestionably be one of the most rapidly developing countrics in the area, havingihe. resources, both human and natural, to bring this about. Substantial amounts of additional US development grant assistance for long range

projects can bc effectively employed in Vietnam. The additional amounts

(c)	Education - Priority should be aCcorded to accelerated

teacher-training programs with an augmented technical-vocational cdu-
Cation program.
(d)	Fishing - The deficient protein content of the Vietnamese diet

of secondary road systems in the rural areas to permit imore efficient
marketing of agriculture products as well as to assist in exploitation of

and liberated areas and to accelerate self-help in rural development
activities. This program, despite numerous difficulties, has
aChieved satisfactory results to date and presents itself as a most
convenient and realistio mechanism for the Presidential Task Force

Covert Actions
a.	Intelligence: Expand current positive and counter-intelligence
operations against Communist forces in South Vietnam and against North
Vietnam. These include penetration of the Vietnamese Communist
mechanism, dispatch of agents to North Vietnam and strengthening
Vietnamese internal security services. Authorization should be given,
subject to existing procedures, for the use in North Vietnam operations
of civilian air crews of American and other nationality, as appropriate,
in addition to Vietnamese. Consideration should be given for over-
flights of North Vietnam for photographic intelligence coverage, using
American or Chinese Nationnlists crews and equipment as necessary.
b.	Communications Intelligence: Expand the current program of
interception and direction finding covering Vietnamese Communist
communications activities in South Vietnam, as well as North Vietnam
targets. Obtain further USIB authority to conduct these operations on Qf
a fully joint basis, permitting the sharing of results of interception,
direction finding, traffic analysis and cryptographic analysis by American
agencies with the Victnamese to the extent needed to launch rapid
attacks on Vietnamese Communist communications and command
installations.

This program should be supplemented by a program, duly coordinated, of training additional Vietnamese Army units in intercept and direction finding by the US Army Security Agency. Also, US rmy Security Agency teams could be sent to Vietnam for direct operations, coordinated in the same manner -- Approved by the President at the NSC meeting of 29 April 1961.
c.	Unconventional Warfare: Expand present operations of the First Observation Battalion in guerrilla areas of South Vietnam, under joint MAAG-CIA sponsorship and direction. This should be in full operational Collaboration with the Vietnamese, using Vietnamese civilians recruited with CIA aid.
In Laos, infiltrate teams under light civilian cover to Southeast Laos to locate and attack Vietnamese Communist bases and lines of communications. These teams should be supported by assault units of 100 to 150 Vietnamese for use on targets beyond A •j.pa'bility 6f teams'.

This funding program is discussed under two headings: (a) GVN Defense Budget (local Currency) and (b) MAP. It is understood that these are estimated figures and that the Task Force will attempt more detailed estimates as programs are approved.
(	a. Defense Budget: (Looal currency GVN defense budget re-

surgency, the GVN defense budget has had to be increased materially over the past two years. The GVN defense budget is mutually agreed , - upon by the GVN and MAAG." The budget for FY 60 and our present

2. Funding of budget: Funding of its defense budget is accom-
plished by GVN, with the US providing imported commodities which are

was as follows:
4,	•	FY 60
r	US Contribution	155. 5
L		
	GVN Contribution	12. 5
L	TOL GVN Defense Budget	168.0
Prior to the initiation of the CIP, the GVN proposed a defense
budget of $177 for FY 61. No agreement has been reached between the
USG and GVN as to provisions of funds for this budget. Prior to the
development of tile Program of Action for Vietnam antioipated expenses
associated with the implementation of the Counter-Insurgency Plan, and

other requirements, made it necessary to incrcase the earlier estimate
of GVN Dcfense Budget for FY 61 to $212. 0. The status of funding of
this amount is as follows: ICA has agreed to provide $134. 0 and GVN
has agreed to provide $20. 0 leaving a short-fall of $58.0. The Country
Team has. recorrunended that US contribute an additional $19.0. If
this were approved, it would raise the total FY 61 US contribution to ■
$153.0 mil-lion, but would still leave a short-fall of $39. 0 million.
L
Mr. Thuan (GVN Secretary of State for the PresidenCy and Minister
of Defense) stated on 24 March 1961 that the GVN would like to receive
more American aid, but if this were not possible the GVN will have to
choose between the Communist danger and thc danger of inflation. The

QVN in this case,, of course, would choose to risk the danger of inflation and could meet the financial burden of the CounterInsurgency Plan in 1961, Secretary Thuan, however, expressed considerable concern regarding the prospects for 1962.*
I While recognizing that the final levels of both US and Viet-
namese contributions to the FY 61 defcnse budget are still under negotiation, it must be kept in mind that in order to be certain that the 20, 000 additional soldiers now authorized for the GVN Army arc brought into the troop basis promptly, it may be necessary for the US to increase FY 61 contribution by the amount of the short-fall of $58 million to insure the success of the CounterInsurgency Plan.
In order to implement items in the Counter-Insurgency Plan which are agreed to by thc GVN and to Carry out the additional measures recommended herein, the GVN defense budget for FY 62 ...
might be in the order of $247. This budget would include, if mutually agreed upon, a US Contribution of $161. 0 million and a Vietnamese contribution of $86. 0 million. This would provide the
.local currenoy needed to carry out this program of action for Vietnam. The Task Force points out that this level requires a four-fold increase

over the FY 61 GVN contribution. If the Vietnamese are unable to ' provide this level of funds, there will again be a substantial short-fall which the US might have to meet if the program as outlined is to be mounted.

of $140 million is required for Military Assistance in FY 62 for
Vietnam. This amount is $71 million more than is currently- programmed for Vietnam within thc Current World Wide FY 62 MAP of $1. 6 billion, : which is a holding program pending results of an Executive Brandi

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JCS
SUBJECT: U. S. Forces for South Vietnam
In preparation for the possible commitment of U. S. forces to Vietnam, it is desired that you give further review and study of the military advisability of such an action, as well as to the size and composition of such U. S. forces. Your views, which I hope could include some expression from CINCPAC, would be valuable
1 for consideration prior to the NSC meeting this week (currently scheduled for Friday, May 12.)
The missions for such U.S. forces, and preliminary concepts of size and composition, are given in section 2c of the May 6 draft of "A Program of Action to Prevent Communist Domination of South Vietnam." JCS members of the Presidential Task Force participated in formulating the thinking on these, with this guidance, and with the other studies which I appreciate you have undertaken already on this area, it is my hope that you will be able to provide me with a recommendation which will assist the NSC discussion of this subject.

Dear Mr. President:
I have asked Vice President Johnson to go to Viet-Nam on my bchalf to visit you personally, to give you my warmest greetings, to witness the valiant struggle of your people against Communist aggression, and to assure you that my message of April 27 was more than an expression of moral support.
r
Since I took office my colleagues and I have watChed develop-ments in Viet-Nam with attention and concern. We have been urgently considering ways in which our help could be made more effective. I can now tell you that, for our part, we are ready to join with you in an intensified endeavor to win the struggle against Communism and to further the social and economic advancement of Viet-Nam. Because of thc grcat importance we attad to this matter, I have asked Vice Presidcnt Johnson and Ambassador Nolting to discuss it fully with you.
If such an expanded joint effort meets with your approval, we are prepared to initiate in collaboration with your government a series of joint, mutually supporting actions in the military, politiCal, economic and other fields. We would propose to extend and build on our existing programs including the Counterinsurgency Plan and infuse into our actions a high sense of urgenCy and dedication.
It is my understanding that Certain of the proposals in the c Counterinsurgency Plan may not entirely reflect your own judg-ment, However, I hope you would feel free to discuss any issues frankly with Ambassador Nolting so that we may find a common viewpoint. I am happy to tell you, however, that the steps already • taken to implement'the Plan have made'it possible for us to have approved Military AssistanCe Program support of the 20, 000 increase of your regular forces.

1 spdak first of military measures. But I fully share your view that Communism cannot be stoppcd by such measures alone. Parallel political and economic action is of equal importance. I believe we are in agreement that the military actions proposed in the Counterinsurgency Plan for Controlling and defeating the Vict Cong are soundly conceived and should be taken. However, in light of current conditions, these measures may no longer be sufficient. Therefore, in addition to notions in the Counter-insurgency Plan, we would be prepared to:
1. Augment the personnel of the MAAG to enable it to carry out increased duties.
Expand the MAAG's duties to include supporting and
advising the Self Defense Corps.
• 3. Provide Military Assistance Program support for the entire Civil Guard force of 68,000.
4.	Provide material support for the Vietnamese Junk Force to help it prevent clandestine supply and infiltration of the Viet Cong.		

We would also be prepared to consider carefully with you,_ if developments should warrant, the case for a further increase in . the strength of your forces beyond the 170, 000 limit now contemplated.
  I also believe that the problem of Viet — Nam's borders requires our further urgent joint study to develop techniques whereby crossing of these borders by unfriendly elements Can be more effectively controlled.
L
I believe we should consider the establishment in Southeast Asia of a facility to develop and test, using the tools of modern technology, new techniques to help us in our joint campaign against the Communists.

In the political field, in addition to the steps contemplated in the Counterinsurgency Plan, I feel you will agree that the strengthening of border control arrangements, particularly with Cambodia, is perhaps the most important element. Whil_ I fully recognize the difficulty and delicacy of this problem, I urge you to authorize the renewal of negotiations on this subject with the Royal Khmer Government. If you concur, we will use our best efforts with the Cambodians to facilitate these discussions.
Other governments have shown an intcrest in assisting Viet-Nam in its actions against the guerrillas and have indicated that Certain expert personnel with long experience, e. g. , in Malaya,
might be made available to help, with your government in planning welcome assistance.
We would be glad to cooperate the most cffective use of this
Turning to the cconomiC aspects,
I am aware of the increased
burden that an increase in your military forces will place on your internal budget. However, budgetary problems must not be permitted to interfere with the sucoessful prosecution of our joint cffort against the Communists. It seems to us that the. Chief problem is how to make thc best possible use of all available
c -csources-. This is a complex problem which taxes the ability of the best experts and we feel must be attacked by the best talent v/e both can muster. If you Concur, I will send to Viet-Nam a group of highly qualified economic and fiscal experts who would ' meet xvith your experts and work out a financial plan on which our joint efforts can be based.

. I wish to assure you of our Continued interest in the sooial advance-ment and economic betterment of your people. Various joint programs are under way and much has bccn accomplished. These will be continucd and improved.

In addition, Ambassador Nolting will be prepared to discuss new economic and social measures in rural areas to accompany the anti-guerrilla effort in which the U.S. can provide direct assist-_ ance, if desired. Such programs, we feel, can be organized, in dose cooperation with military operations and with maximum mobility, speed and flexibility. Funds for expanded efforts along these lines can be allocated.

We have great confidence in the long-range political and economic futurc of Viet-Nam. Therefore, I am certain you will ag ree that, despite our present focus on the immediate Viet Cong problem, it would be good for us to work together toward a longer range economic development program, including increased assistance on our part in the fields of agriculture, health, education, fisheries, highways, public administration and industrial development. I have authorized Ambassador Nolting to enter into preliminary discussions with members of your government concerning the best ways of moving forward with a program whose eventual goal would be a Viet-Nam capable of self-sustaining economic growth.
This, Mr. President, is thfe broad outline of our thinking on how we can help you and your brave countrymen to help themselves in their determined struggle to defeat the Communists and find a better way of life. I am confident of your succcss. I look forward with great interest to Vine President Johnson’s report on his talks with you, and I would be especially happy to hear from you .

6 May 1961
A Program of Action
To Prevent Communist Domination of South Vietnam
Appraisal of the Situation: The internal sccurity situation in
South Vietnam has become critical, as can be seen on thc attaChcd
map, with an estimated 12, 000 Viet Cong Communists waging
guerrilla warfare inside the Country. The strongly anti-Communist,
pro-American government of South Vietnam, with American aid, is
n
increasing its capabilities to fight its attackers. Should the Com-
r
munist effort increase, cither direotly or as a result of a collapse
of Laos, additional measures beyond those proposed herein may be
necessary. (Details in Annex 1. ).
The U.S, Objcctive: To prevent Communist domination of South
Vietnam and to create in that country a viable and inCreasingly
democratiC society.
Concept of Operations: To initiate, on an accelerated basis, a
series of mutually’ supporting aCtions of a military, political, economic
• psychological and covert charaCter designed to aohieve this objective.
In so doing, it is intended to use, and where appropriate extend,
expedite or build upon the existing U.S. and Government of Vietnam

(G. V.N.) programs, including as much of the Countcr-Insurgcncy Plan (CIP), as can be agreed by both governments, already underway in South Vietnam. There is neither thc time available nor any
■ sound justification for "starting from scratCh." Rather the need is to focus the U.S. effort in South Vietnam on the immediate internal security problem; to infuse it with, a sense of urgency and a dedica-tion.to the overall U.S. objcCtive; to achieve, through Cooperative inter-dcpartmcntal support both in the field and in Washington, the operational flexibility needed to apply the available U.S. assets in a manner best calculated to achieve our objective in Vietnam; to give thc U.S. Ambassador and the U.S, team under his leadership
gcneral authority to undertake a series of accelerated measures as noted below; and finally, to impress on our friends, the Vietnamese, and on our foes, the Communists, that come what may, the U.S. intcnds to win this battle.
Program of Action:
1. General: The situation in South Vietnam has reached the point where, at least for the time being, primary emphasis must be placed on providing a solution to the internal security problem. A significant step which has already been taken by the Country Team to counter Communist subversion in South Vietnam has been the development of the Counter-Insurgency Plan (CIP).

nel will be required immediately in addition to the present complement
of 635.

premise that such an undertaking is justified in international law as represcnting a refusal to be bound by the Acoords in a degree and manner beyond that which the other party to the Accords has shown a willingness
to honor. Communist violations, therefore, justify the establishment

Your thoughtful and under standing letter of May 8th,1961 .which was handed to me by Vice-President Johnson .contains wise and farsighted proposals , man v of which I myself have advocated for four years or more, I was accordingly glad to tell Vice-PreSident Johnson without hesitation that the Government of Vietnam accepts the proposals in your letter to initiate, in collaboration with the Government of the United States,the scries cf joint, mutually supporting actions to win the struggle against communism in Victnam and further the advancement of our country. Our agreement to these proposals was made public in the joint communique which . was released to the press on Saturday morning 13th,just before Vice-President Johnson’s departure from Saigon.	.
In the course of our frank and fruitful conversations, Vice-President Johnson graciously asked for my ovm suggestionS aS to the most urgent needs as v/e See them to save our country-from the viciouS communist aggression beinc waged against us, both within our borders and from every side today. I was most deeply gratified by this gracious gesturc by your distinguished Vicd-President,pc rticularly aS we have not become accustomed to being asked for our ov/n views as to our needs. The recent developments in Laos have emphasized our grave concern for thc security cf our country with its long and. vulnerable frontiers,	•	•	•

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY GILPATRIC
SubjeCt: U.S. Combat Forces for Vietnam
Thc following sums up the information made available to me on the possible deployment of U. S. cohibat forces in Vietnam.
On 10 May, the JCS recommended that President Diem be encouraged to request that the U.S. fulfill its SEATO obligation, in view of the new threat imposed by the Laotian situation, by the immediate deployment of appropriate U.S. forces to South Vietnam. Details of size and composition of suitable forces were awaiting the views of CINCPAC and CEIMAAG.
On 12 May, this Subject was discussed'by President Diem and Vine President Johnson in Saigon. Ambassador Nolting reported this discussion, noting that President Diem would desire U.S. (or SEATO) combat forCes only in case of overt aggression. The introduction of foreign combat forces would contravene and signify the end of the Geneva acoord. (General Williams, former MAAG Chief, agrees that this is in line with previous thinking by President Diem. )	.
Ambassador Nolting added that President Diem would welcome • as many U.S. military personnel as needed for training and advising Vietnamese forces. General McGarr, Chief of MAA.G who was pre' ’sent at this ’discussion also, repdrtcd that while President Diern
would not want U.S. combat forces for the purpose of fighting Communists in South Vietnam, he would accept deployment of U.S. combat forces as trainers for the Vietnamese forces at any time.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
L
Size and Composition:
There has been considerable study of the size and composition of U.S. combat forces for possible deployment to Vietnam. The latest I have seen were CINCPAC's tentative views, after refine-ment, A U-. S. Army infantry division to the High Plateau region, reinforced with Army Aviation, Engineers, Artillery, ctc. The Seventh Fleet would relieve the Vietnamese need for readiness to resist largc scale invasion by sea. A minimum number of U. S. Navy patrol craft to help develop and train the Vietnamese Junk Forces, while initially supplementing the efforts. The air effort would be based near Saigon, with cight B57's (later relieved by FIDO squadron) for border surveillance, four Fl02:s for possible air defense, two or three TAG recce aircraft, and provisional C47 squadron.
Lo Cation:
Much of tile thinking has been on stationing U.S. combat forCes in the High Plateau, where they would be well located in relation to borders vulnerable to overt Communist aggression. However, Gencral Williams has written a brief memo for me, recommending such U.S. forces be stationed on the Coast, at Da Nang (Tourane), Nha Trang, and Phan Thiet, where sea, road, rail, and air facilities would pcrmit further deployment as necessary in a contingency.
Any of thc above loCations would permit the relief of Vietnamese forces for training or operations against the Viet Cong. Also, any of the above locations have good areas for training of Vietnamese forces, if this were to be a mission of the U.S. forces.
Recommendations:
Since tile deployment of U.S. combat forces in Vietnam is predicated on-the request for them, by the Government of Vietnam, since this request hasn’t been made yet, and since President Diem is sending. Nguyen Dinh Thuan (Secretary of Security, Defense, Interior, etc. ) to Washington next week to bring us Vietnam’s "definitive military needs, " it is reCommended that you explore this subject with Secretary Thuan towards getting a precise definition of the use of U.S. forces in Vietnam, With concrete information, you will then have a firm position for further deCisions.

MEMORANDUM
TO:
The President
FROM:	The Vice President
SUBJECT:Mission to Southeast Asia, India and Pakistan
The mission undertaken May 9, 1961, at your request, was informative and illuminating far beyond my expectations. Unusual candor -- as well as unusual length — marked exchanges in each country. Each leader bisited selcomed and sought to take full advantage of my presence as a means of transmitting to uou their strongly held personal views on many matters.
The purpose of this memorandum is to convey such of my own impressions and evaluations as seem most pertinent to decisions now under your consideration. It would be unrealistic to assume that such limited visits afford a basis for detailed substantive policy judgments. It would be equally unrealistic not to recognize that the circumstances and timing of this mission elicited a depth and substance of expression not normally present in exchanges through casual channels. My purpose is to offer perspective -- not, I wish to emphasize, to propose details of policy.
The Impact of Laos
There is no mistaking the deep - and long lasting -- impact of recent developments in Laos.
Country to country, the degree differs but Laos- has created doubt and concern about intentions of the United States throughout Southeast Asia. No amount of success at Geneva can, of itself, erase this. The independent Asians do not wish to have their own status resolved in like manner in Geneva.

1 Their charity extends no farther.	•
The Im pact of the M i ssion •
Beyond question, your judgment about the timing of our mission was correct. Each leader -- except Nehru -- publicly congratulated you on the '’timing'1 o£ this mission. Chiang said -- and all others privately concurred -- that the mission had the effect of "stabilizing' the situation in the Southeast Asian nations. .
r
Lj
What happened, I believe, was this: the leaders visited want -as long as they can --to remain as friends or allics of the United States. The public, or, more precisely, the political, reaction to Laos had drastically weakened the ability to maintain any strongly-pro-US orientation. Neutralism in Thailand, collapse in Vietnam, anti-American clcction demagoguery in the Philippines were all dcvcloping prior to our visit. The show of strength and sinoerity -partly because you had sent the Vice Prcsident and partly, to a grcatcr extent than you may believe, bccausc you had sent your
sister -- gave the friendly 1 on" for a while longer.
something to "hang their hats
Our mission arrcstcd thc decline of confidence in thc United States. It did not -- in my judgment -- restore any confidence already lost. The leadcrs were as explicit, as courtco.us and courtly as men could be in making it clear that deeds must follow words -- soon.

The Purpose of Joint Communiques
Starting with President Diem at Saigon
my conclusion
that thc interests of the Unitcd Statcs would be served -- and protected -by thc issuance of joint communiques. My purpose was this; to attach thc signature and thc name of each of thc leaders to a joint public statement e. bodying thcir acccptance of an agrecmcnt with thc dctails of your letters which I delivered in your behalf. Without such statements in writing, it was clear that thc Unitcd States would bc victimized later by' self-serving st foments that you -- and the Administration -- had offcred "nothing" or "too little, ” etc.	.	.
As you recognized, the joint communiques followed item by item the
tatements in your letters.
Washington before issuanc
In most instances, where substantive pledges the communiques were cleared through
The extensive, important and almost
unprecedented communique with Nehru largely reflects the high regard ' the Indian Government holds for Ambassador Galbraith.
I should make these two points clear: assurances I gave were those, you sent me to convey, and no comrnitmcnts were asked and none were givcn beyond those authorizcd in your letters. In some instances, for various reasons, I did not, cxpress all the commitments or proposals authorizcd in the State position papers.
Thc Importance of Follow-Through
. I cannot stress too strongly thc extreme importance of following up ; this mission with other measures, other actions, and other efforts. At
thc moment -- becausc of Laos -- thcse nations arc hypersensitive to the possibility of American hypocrisy toward Asia. Considering the Vienna talks with Khrushchev -- which, to the Asian mind, emphasize ■ Western rathcr than Asian concerns -- and considering the negative line of various doxnestic American editorials about this mission, I strongly i bclieve it is of first importance that this trip bear fruit immediately.

Pcrsonal Conclusions from thc Mission
• I took to Southeast Asia some basic convictions about the problems faced there. I have come away from the mission there -- and to India and Pakistan -- with many of those convictions sharpened and deepened by what I saw and learncd. I havc also rcachcd Certain other conclusions which I belicvc may be of value as guidance for those responsible in formulating policies.	.
These conclusions are as follows:
1. The battle against Communism-niust'be'jdine'dTn Southeast Asia’.t • /with strength and determination to achicvc success there -- or
^the United States,, inevitably, musTsurrcnder the Pacific'a'nd take
our dcfcnscs’dn pur.own shores/ Asian Communism is compromised and contained by thc maintenance of free nations on the subcontinent. Without this inhibitory influence, the island outposts -- Philippines, Japan, Taiwan -- havc no sccurity and the vast Pacific becomes a
. Red Sea.	...
2. (The‘struggle is’ far~fronflost' in" Southeast 'Asia”ahd~it_l s py. no.,) means inevitable that it must be lost. In each country it is possible to build a sound structure capable of withstanding and turning the Communist surge. Thc will to rcsist -- while now the targetuf subversive attack -- is there. The key to what is done by Asians in defense of Southcast Asian freedom is confidence in the United Statcs.	•	•
3. irhcT'ensIhrNaftcrnative to United Statcs'l'eaae’rship-in'SoutheasfAsiav^ Leadership in individual countries --or the regional leadership and cooperation so appealing to Asians -- rests on the knowledge and faith . in Unitcd States power, will and understanding.

We should consider an alliance of all the free nations of the 
Pacific and Asia who are willing to join forces in defense of their freedom. Such an organization should:	.
a)	Have clear cut command authority
b)	also devote attention to measures and programs of social-justice, housing, land reform, etc.
5.	Asian leaders' -- at this time - do not want American troops
involved in Southeast Asia other than on training missions. American . combat troop involvement is not only not required, it is not desirable.
Possibly Americans -- fail to appreciate fully the subtlety that recently-colonial peoples would not look with favor upon governments which invited or accepted the return this soon of Western troops. To the extent that fear of ground troop involvement dominates our political responses to Asia in Congress or elsewhere, it seems most desirable to me to allay those paralyzing fears in confidence, on the strength of the individual statements made by leaders consulted on this trip.  This does not minimize or disregard the probability that open attack would bring calls for U. S. combat troops. But the present probability of open attack seems scant, and we might gain much needed flexibility in our policies if the spectre of combat troop commitment could be lessened domestically.		
6.	Any help -- economic as well as military -- we give less developed nations to secure and maintain their freedom must be a part of a
mutual effort. These nations cannot be saved by United States help alone. To the extent the Southeast Asian nations are prepared to take the necessary measures to make our aid effective, we can be --and must be -- unstinting in our assistance. It would be useful to enunciate more clearly than we have -- for the guidance of these young and unsophisticated nations -- what we expect or require of them.				


7.	In large measure, the greatest danger Southeast Asia offers to nations like the United States is not the momentary threat of Communism itself, rather that danger stems from hunger, ignorance, poverty and disease. We must -- whatever strategies we evolve --keep these enemies the point of our attack, and make imaginative use of our scientific and technological capability in such enterprises.

He is frank about hls,belief, offensive as it is to us, that the forms of representative government would only open his Country to Communist take-over at this time. Nonetheless, Ayub understands -- and is in agreement with -- the aims of eradicating poverty, ignorance and discase. Wc can have great influence and. -because of his administrative organization -- achieve drarnatic sucoess by supporting Pakistan's needs, Our military should see how to improve the effectiveness and achieve modernization of Pakistan's array.

Release Indian and Pakistani troops to deter the Chinese rather than each other. He spells out the fact that U.S. leadership rests on our own self-confidence and confidence we permit Asians to have in us.
To recapitulate, these are the main impressions I have brought back from my trip.
The fundamental decision required of the United States -- and time of the greatest importance -- is whether we are to attempt to meet the challenge of Communist expansion now in Southeast Asia by a major effort in support of the forces of freedom in the area or throw in the towel. This decision must be made in a full realization of the very heavy and continuing costs involved in terms of money, of effort and of United States prestige. It must be made with the knowledge that at some point i we may be faced with the further decision of whether we commit major •
United States forces to the area or cut our losses and withdraw should our other efforts fail, we must remain master in this decision, what we do in Southeast Asia should be part of a rational program to meet the ' threat we face in the region as a whole. It should include a clear-cut pattern of specific contributions to be expected by each partner according to his ability and resources. I recommend we proceed with a clear-cut and strong program of action.
i
I believe that the mission -- as you conceived it -- was a success.
I am grateful to the many who labored to make it so.

are willing to fight and die for their freedom, not withstanding the temptations to neutralism and its false promises of peace being drummed into their ears daily by the communists.
In the light of this situation, the council of generals concluded.that additional forces numbering slightly over 100,000 more than our new'force level of 170,000 will be required to counter the ominous threat of communist domination. The 100,000 reservists to be called up according to the plan of my council of generals were to meet the requirement for an augmentation of the Vietnamese Army by nine infantry divisions plus modest naval and air force increases. First priority called for one division to reinforce each of the three Army Corps in Vietnam plus a two divisional general reserve for a total of five divisions. In second priority, an additional division for each of the three Army Corps plus one in general reserve brought the total to nine new divisions, with the seven existing divisions, fragmented in anti-guerilla operations, the Army of Vietnam would thus have a strength of 16 divisions of slightly less than 10,000 men each plus appropriate combat and logistic support units.
we have now had an opportunity to review this initial force requirement with General McGarr and the MAAG staff who have recommended certain modifications which are basically in consonance with our plan and with which we agree.
After considering the recommendations of our generals and consulting with our American military advisors, we now conclude that to provide even minimum initial resistance to the threat, two new divisions of approximately 10,000 strength each are required to be activated at the earliest possible date. Our lightly held defensive positions along the demilitarized zone at our Northern border is even today being outflanked by communist forces which have defeated the Royal Laotian Army garrisons in Tchepone and other cities in Southern Laos. Our ARVN forces are so throughly committed to internal anti-guerilla operations that we have no effective forces with which to counter this threat from Southern Laos. Thus, we need immediately one division for the First Army Corps and one for the Second Army Corps to provide at least some token resistance to the sizeable forces the communists are capable of bringing to bear against our Laotian frontier. Failing this, we would have no recourse but to withdraw our forces southward from the demilitarized zone and sacrifice progressively greater areas of our country to the communists. These divisions should be mobilized and equipped, together with initial logistic support units immediately after
168

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
' .
completion of activation of the presently contemplated increase of 20,000 which you have offered to support.
Following the activation of these units, which should begin in about five months, we must carry on the program of activation of additional units until over a period of two years we will have achieved a force of 14 infantry divisions, an expanded airborne brigade of approximately division strength and accompanying supporting elements of logistical, naval and air units. In other words, our present needs as worked out with General McGarr's advice and assistance call for a total force of 15 divisional equivalents plus combat and logistic support units instead of our original plan for a 16 division force. Tile strategic concept and mission of this total 270,000 man force remains the
I same, namely, to overcome the insurgency which has risen to the • scale of a bloody, communist-inspired civil war within our borders and to provide initial resistance to overt, external aggression until free world forces under the SEATO agreement can come to our aid. The question naturally arises as to how long we shall have to carry the burden of so sizeable a military force. Unfortunately, I can see no early prospects for the reduction of such a force once it has been established, for even though we may be successful in liquidating the insurgency within our borders, communist pressure in Southeast A.sia and the external military threat to our country must be expected to increase, I fear, before it diminishes. This means that we must be prepared to maintain a strong defensive military posture for at least the foreseeable future in order that we may not become one of the so-called "soft spots" which traditionally have attracted communist aggression. We shall therefore continue to need material ;	support to maintain this force whose requirements far exceed the
capacity of our economy to support.
To accomplish this 100,000 man expansion of our military forces which is perfectly feasible from a manpower viewpoint will require a great intensification of our training programs in order to produce, in the minimum of time, those qualified combat leaders and technical specialists needed to fill the new units and to provide to them the technical and logistic support required to insure their complete effectiveness. For this purpose a considerable expansion of the United States Military Advisory Group is an essential requirement. Such an expansion, in the form of selected elements of the American Armed Forces to establish training centers for the Vietnamese Armed Forces, would serve the dual purpose of providing an expression of the United States’ determination to halt the tide of communist aggression and of preparing our forces in the
169

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
minimum of time.
while the Government and people of Vietnam are prepared to carry the heavy manpower burden required to save our country, we must know that we cannot affort to pay, equip, train and maintain such forces as I have described. To make this effort possible, we would need to have assurances that this needed material support would be provided. I have drawn on our past experience of United States support we have received to make some extremely rough estimates of the costs of these proposals.
i
The costs of providing essential initial equipment to the added forces under the Military Assistance Program would probably be in the neighborhood of $175,000,000 with deliveries to be distributed over the next two and one-half years as units can be activated. If the United States assumes the task of providing this initial equipment for the additional forces, I understand that the annual Military Assistance Program for force maintenance will increase by about $20 million above the level of MAP support for the presently authorized 170,000 force.
The Vietnamese Military Budget, which includes piaster requirements, must also be supplemented. As you know, Vietnam contributes to this budget to its fullest capability now with respect to existing forces. Despite our best efforts, your Government has largely supported this budget through Defense Support Assistance. Although we have made • significant progress in developing our economy in the last four years, the support of even the inadequate armed forces we have has far exceeded the modest capabilities of the economy of our small country. In order to carry out the expansion of forces, the piaster military budget now averaging nearly 7.0 billion piasters a year will have to be supplemented. As I see it, the annual maintenance cost will increase gradually during the force implementation and will ultimately level off at approximately 10.60 billion piasters.
This program, I realize, will be expensive in money, equipment and personnel. The benefits to be gained, however, in preventing the subjugation of our free people and in establishing a solid obstacle to the advance of communism, I know you will agree,"far outweigh the cost, with your support, we stnad determined to survive in independence and freedom.
It goes without saying that in the face of the extremely serious situation created by the communist aggressor, we must temporarily
170

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
accord pnority to the military problems, However, my Government doss net attach lcoa importance to economic ,political and Social prebic'ny . At this point the doctrinal position whieh pertains to South ViTiuarn is clear and clean. It was expressed in a free and sin ar e ma.v.ncr in my message to the Arne ri can Congress in April 195/, It has not varicd since. Neither did it vary during the recent presidential campaign when I was elected by a very, large majority.
Presently, it (3 accessary net tc bc maneuvered by the communists, who exploit our tendency to consider military efforts as reactionary and fruitless, to divert our effective action, which is ne cos sins ted by thc rno.tal communist attacks, toward a long range project of economic and social improvement, and which, of course, supposes that we aie still alive. IVc sec for thc army ar. econom'c and social misnion along with military role, a conception which rationally responds tc thc double challenge which thc newly independent countries of Africa and Asia have had to fa.ee : underdevelopment and co mm uniat subversive war. It is along this line that, since my taking office in July 1954, I havc undertaken to create an economic infrastructure throughout the country, including the least inhabited regions ; to devcicp thc lines of communication with thc double purpose of facilitating inter course and facilitating the mobility of our troops ; to increase and diversify the agricultural production ; to give each family a tract of land which will belong to them ; to create each day more employment by industrializing thc country ; in brief to open new horizons to the rural massts, thc dotermining factor in thc struggle against communiam. It is sufficient to consider thc product of our exportation these last two years, the reduction of our importation program, to count thc factory chimneys which
■ mate thcir appearance to realize the progress already made . On thc other hand, in spite of its lack of resources, thc Governtnr.nt increases thc social investments to respond to thc divcrsifiod needs cf a population which increases at the rate of 3°/o per year : hospitals in the towns, dispensaries in the villages, primary schools in each commune, secondary schools in each city of whatever importance . Education is developing at the annual rate of 20o/o while in the 'domain’of public health, we hayc a hospital bed available for each thousand inhabitants . We want to progress more rapidly but,'in addition to ths budgetary limitations which constitutc a primary obstacle, thc lank of trained personnel has made itsclf felt despite our accelerated training programs . The agrovilles, which I have built in the last year, are another proof of thc Government’s efforts : These are agricultural communities located between two urban centers to give the rural population thc benefits of thc commodities of modern life and to correct thc extreme dispersion of thc
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
population. All foreign observers who travel in the country are struck by the standard of living enjoyed by the mass of peasants: sewing machine, bicycle, transistor radio for each family in more or less comfortable circumstances, theater, movies in the most backward areas, motor boats on the inumerable canals, tricycle busses on all passable roads. And it is precisely in order not to interrupt this development program that we ask for supplementary aid to finance our war effort; otherwise we will be forced to make the tragic decision to abruptly cease all our social and economic programs.
Concerning Cambodia, our diplomatic efforts would have results only if we recognize our adversary.
The idea of Cambodia being afraid of Vietnam is a myth. For 7 years, Sihanouk has not missed one chance to provoke South Vietnam, of which he has militarily occupied six islands. Having no reason to fear a Vietnam, divided and weakened by the subversive communist war, Sihanouk has nothing to fear at all. However, this idea would be pleasing to those who would seek to arbitrate between Cambodia and South Vietnam. It would also be pleasing to certain Vietnamese because this idea is flattering to their vanity and to their infantilism which consists of minimizing the difficulties and proposing any solutions. It would also be pleasing to Sihanouk who has a need to give substance to another myth that of encirclement which he needs to excuse his internal failures in order to justify his presence in power, to accuse the Americans and to court the communists.
In reality, Sihanouk is committed intellectually and morally to communism, which he considers the stronger party and the inevitable victor in the future. In spite of the aid which he receives from America, has Sihanouk ever aided the US in the battle with the communists? He always takes positions favorable to the communists against the USA. His conduct in the Laotian affair is clear. Not only does he serve the communists, but he is proud to serve a stronger master. On the other hand, Cambodia, like Laos, is unable to ensure the security of her territory from the communist guerillas because he will not or does not wish to make the appropriate efforts. It is for this reason that he takes refuge in communist servitude under the guise of a neutralist. It is also for that reason that he has always refused to accept any arrangement for the effective control of the Cambodian-Vietnamese border under the fallacious pretext of neutrality.
From the political point of view, the reforms that I have anticipated,

.Comments by Vietnamese Officials
following information has been received from Colonel Ed
Following is memo of my conversation with Vice President Tho on 10 July prepared for the Ambassador at his request, Mr. Tho invited me to his office as a result of a note of introduction from General Lansdale.

Taking advantage of the opportunity I reviewed briefly the presentation which Staley-Thuc were prcparing to make to President.
I Diem stressing the "breakthrough concept, " the need to mobilise Vietnam’s full effort to meet the current crisis, and the principle of fa complete joint approaoh on the part of both VN and US Governments f to the emergency. Mr. Tho appeared to be already briefed on this subject. He freely conceded that it was impossible for thc US to provide Vietnam with piasters. He acknowledged that the main source of piaster revenues was for the GVN to provide for-a higher piaster return per dollar of US economic aid imports. The problem which troubled the GVN was thcir fear that such an increase in piaster return per 'dollar of US economic aid would cause a rise in prices and thus, in turn, would create an irresistible demand for broad-based wage increases. Thus the GVN might find itself involved in a wage-price spiral which it would be unable to control. He conceded, hov/cver, that' the'basic problem was more politicaI than economic,.
Turning to more general subjects, Tho pressed me for my opinion of the Current situation in VN. I rcplicd that bascd on my observations made during my last visit in 1956, the Country had achieved tremendous progress. Tho agreed, but still left me with theIimprcssion that he held a more pessimistic view of the situation.'

■ PTho then said he wished to speak frankly concerning the underlying conCern throughout VN, at all levels, that if the GVN wore invaded by communist forces, thc US might not repeat not respond. In this regard, he Cited the dcvelopments in Laos, which hc sard wcrc uppcrmost in the minds of people throughout SE Asia, and which had addcd fuel to these fears. He noted that if the communists did attack it would probably be in conjunction with a well-planned, general Viet Cong uprising throughout South Victnam. He indiCated thcre werc two ways in which the US might provide tangible reassurances, but that both of thcse	,
presented political obstadcs. The first was thc stationing of token US
i: combat units in thc country. This was impracticable at this time as
I it left the GVN open to the highly-cxploitable communist charge that the government was merely substituting thc US for France as a colonial, occupying power. The second was a mutual dcfensc trcaty with the US. This also appeared to be impractical since it would constitute an open repudiation of the Geneva Agreements of 1954. ■	I _
Concerning the internal security situation, Tho stressed the importance of providing thc self defense forces with modern weapons. Today 30 percent of thcir weapons and ammunition are unusable. He pled for early distribution of up-to-date individual weapons to the self defense forCes as one of the most effective means of getting on top of the Vict Cong terrorist campaign. Hc strongly recommended that thc weapon needed by these forces was thc light weight carbine, not thc larger, heavy M-l.	. I	•
Referring to the emergency program, recommended in the
Staley-Thue economiC report, I askcd Tho if he thought thc GVN had ;-the administrative and managerial resources to complete 100 new
e agrovilles- in.18 months. He said he believed it could be done provi 1 it were handled in a manner which did not antagonize the pc^onle. I j told him the cost estimates in thc report included funds to pTy the
ed
villagers reasonable wages for thcir labor in constructing the new agrovilles. '.Tho v/as greatly relieved to hear this and indicated tha. this being the case he was reasonably confident the agroville program could be completed on schedule.	•	•	.

were present now have full picture of this key clement of economic equation. President allowed Thuan to state current GVN position. For
' their part in 18 month crash program. GVN will institute tax reforms, float victory bond issue, take measures to insure realization of 60	—

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. GILPATRIC	. '
• , •
SUBJECT: The Staley Report.
‘ . • -
Attached is thc "Joint A.ction Program Proposed by the Vietnem-U.S. Special Financial Groups" which has been submitted to both President Kennedy and President Diem. The latter react the report very carefully before ire left Saigon end we understand has approved it insofar as his country is concerned. I recommend you read, as a minimum, the covering letter, para-graph 6 and sections III and IV (these are marked with paperclips).	.	.
In Vietnam, as in many other areas of the world where the fight with the Communists is joined, thc difference between success or failure will be determined not so much by the amount of the money we spend, but by _ the speed with which we act. The critical factor is time.
The amount of additional U.S. funds recommended by the Staley group over and above the current level of U.S. effort in Vietnam comes to the modest stun of $85.5 million, for the next eighteen months, of which $42 million is MAP.	.
.	1
•	• You will note that while the U.S. is making this contribution, the
Vietnamese will also be contributing $6.5 billion piasters (approximately $103 million at 60 piasters per/dollar).■ • In other words, the attached program is trurtly, as its title indicates, a joint action program by both the Vietnamese and the U.S. Governments.
- • • . • ■ ■
From the standpoint of maintaining impetus behind the current counter-_	• insurgency program within Vietnam, and to insure that the U.S. Government
• takes prompt action on the Staley report, it is rec'dsmended that yo :
’	I
a.	Invite Dr. Staley to brief the JCS on his report at your next meeting with the JCS. Mr. Nitze should be invited to attend;
b.	Approve the report in-principle and so notify the Secretary of State (draft letter attached; . ■ ' ' .
• • ■ ■■ ’
c.	Have the report considered at an early NSC meeting to obtain formal Presidential approval of the "Joint-Action Program" and thc general order of magnitude of the additional. U.S. assistance to Vietnam which is recommended;	■

DRAFT
Dear Dean:
The Department of Defense has reviewed the "Joint Action Program Proposed by .the Vietnam-U.S. Special Financial Groups" (The Staley Report) and considers it a well-conceived, realistic program for meeting the stepped-up level of Communist activities in south Vietnam. The Department of Defense concurs in the recommendations contained in the "Joint Action Pxogram", including the proposed force level of 200,000 men for the regular forces by the end of CY 1962.	• •
I suggest that the report be forwarded to the National Security Council for approval, with the understanding that the cost figures and details of the broad programs outlined therein are subject to refinement and adjustment by the appropriate U.S. Government agencies in Vietnam, acting jointly with their Vietnamese counterparts under the guidance of the U.S. Ambassador. • , ,	' .	. •

JOINT ACTION PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE
VIET NAM - UNITED STATES SPECIAL FINANCIAL GROUPS
TO
President Ngo Dinh Diem	.	President John F. Kennedy
The Viet Nam and United States Special Financial Groups charged with 								
considering the means of further cooperation between their two countries for mutually shared purposes have tho honor to propose to their respective governments the attached joint program of action.
Viet Nam is today under attack in a bitter, total struggle which involves its survival as a free nation. Its enemy, the Viet Cong, is ruthless, resourceful, and elusive. This enemy is supplied, reinforced, and centrally directed by the international Communist apparatus operating through Hanoi.
To defeat it requires the mobilization of the entire economic, military    . psychological, and social resources of the country and vigorous, support from
  the United States.			
The long-term economic future of Viet Nam is bright. In fact, the
	 promising start already made toward improvement in the living conditions of
its people appears to be one of the factors which precipitated the recent
	 intensification of Communist pressure. The contrast between the achievements
of recent years in South Viet Nam and the hardships and failure in Communist
	North Viet Nam was becoming too glaring. Given the means to throw back the
Communist attack and to resume its march of economic, social, and political

Io ' INTRODUCTION'
Conscious of tho serious problems created throughout Southeast Asia by tbs. accelerated Communist campaign of subversion and creeping aggression in Inos and in Viot Nem^ President John F. Itennody, in response to an invitation of tha Govemmont of Viet Nams sent Vics President Iyndon B. Johnson to Saigon to discuss with President Ngo Dinh Diem various measures which might bo virlor-
taken by both their governments to proserva tho freedom and security of Viot Nam. One of the consoquencos of these talka was an agreement to send a Special Financial Group composed of U.S. experts to Saigon to explore with their Viotnamoso counterpartn tho economic and financial implications of a plan of action in whicl/tha two govemmento could cooperate in meeting thc emergency situation.	.
President NgoDinh Dicm appointed a similar group of experts to roprahont tho Government of Viot Nam. At their first meeting., the Vietnameno and U0S0 chairmen decided that any report or recommendations which they would submit should ba prepared oh a joint basisp emphasizing thereby the oloao partnership in which tho two governments desire to approach thc problem, Accordingly, they merged their two groups into one and conducted all their business as a completely integrated committee. The following is the spccial action program . which they recommend to the Presidents of Viet Nam and the United States,

•	• .	•	REVIEW OF IHLTTARY SITUATION AND
PECO-	FOR lCOliidHiJEW 1^^^^	,
Mr. .President, as your American military advisor, I feel this is,	.
again, an appropriate time to review the military situation. I know you also feel that we are at a decisive period in the military history of Vietnam, which is today in the vanguard, of the Free World's fight against Communism. Events are moving so fast that it behooves us from time to time to review the events of thc recent past so that we may give better direction to our present and future activities.	f-
Largely because of your keen understanding and assistance, we can	1
point with mutual pride to the accomplishments of thc past few months.
Although the urgency is great and there is still much to do, I am particularly .	heartened by the following actions.
Your approval of the Armed Forces reorganization portion of the Counter-Insurgency Plan has established a single' chain of command from JGS through Field Command to the operating units. The most important implementation phase of this reorganisation, which I shall later discuss at greater length, is now under way.
•	As you lmow, the actual build up of the 20,000 man increase in the RVNAF force structure is now in process with the attendant Budgetary
•	problems apparently on the way to resolution. At your direction, certain .	.of these Units are now being activated and equipment is beginning to arrive
for them in significant quantities;
Also, I feel wc can both be well pleased with the progress made in the overall Civil Guard Program since transfer was effected, to the DOD.
Your establishment of the Central Intelligence Organization is another improvement which, when it becomes fully operational.,- will, together with Military Intelligence improvements, contribute greatly to the c c ( counter-insurgency campaign by ensuring improved Operational Intelligence to the Armed Forces.
The Combat Development and Test Center, discussed with you by , Mr. Godel and myself, and which you. have authorized also holds great
*	promise of assisting in the overall Counter-Insurgency effort.	■	.	,

These organizational type improvements have been acctepanied by what I feel is equally heartening progress in the long delayed training of RVNAF forces and thc Civil Guard. All training programs, both .in-country• and off-shore, have been re-examined and revised to place additional Stress on anti-guerrilla tactics and techniques. Many training courses are now being conducted under the revised programs and results are beginning to be felt.
Immediately following the transfer of the Civil Guard to the Depart-went of Defense, we developed a concept of employment for Civil Guard units, which now serves as the basis for all Civil Guard training. This program includes special leadership training as well as individual unit training, all oriented toward anti-guerrilla combat. 3,500 of the Civil Guard havc been trained to date, and 6,000 are now undergoing individual and unit training at Quang Trung and Song Mao. In addition, 650 are now undergoing OCS and ECO training.
The Ranger training program has continued to receive high priority and emphasis. As you know, a series of U.S. Special Forces teams were brought to Vietnam, one of which is still here, and MAAG developed a program of instruction which was adopted by RViiAF for Ranger Cadre Training. In this respect, your Ranger Training Center at Nha Trang is outstanding. Additionally, an on-site unit training program has been developed to further train Ranger Companies in the vicinity of their actual operational areas using AIWN-US Mobile Training Teams.
•E
Closely tied to improvements in training is the work now being done by the joint RVNAF-MAAG study group on the MAAG paper,' "Tactics and Techniques cf Counter-Insurgent Operations." This is an important pro-ject because it will establish RV.TAF tactical doctrine i.n the Vietnamese language which will be widely distributed to the Armed Forces. Once re-fined and distributed, I believe we can.expect another significant increase in training improvement and subsequently in operations. As you know, however, certain of the concepts proposed in this study, because of their far reaching mid comprehensive nature, will require. policy decisions at a very high governmental level before thc full effect can be gained in the field. The timing and timeliness of these decisions is most essential for ■ anti-guerrilla combat to be successful.
1	' " In the field of tactical operation's, you have authorized MAAG ad-
1 visors to accompany RV1LAP battalion and company-sine units engaged in * operations, with the understanding that they will observe and advise but

will not actually participate in hot war activities. MAAG has arranged for the same authorization from U.S. military authorities. In addition, RVi’AF officers have been encouraged to work closely with U.S. advisors . in the all important operational planning phase which needs additional ' emphasis.	’•
■ '•
Also in the field of operations, I am particularly pleased at the improvements realized in Air-Ground operations. The reaction time on requests for air support and for airborne forces has been significantly reduced as a result of improved operational procedures worked out, with HAAG advice, between your Army and Air Force. In this regard, a concept has been developed employing a specially trained force oi' companysize, on constant airfield alert, with another company-size force equally trained in H-3h helicopter operations, on camp alert. This ready force, coupled with the airborne capability will naterially increase the ability of the RVNAF to counter widely dispersed guerrilla attacks. This, of course, requires that thc primary use of these H-34's be operational and not admini strative,
The foregoing, Mr. President, are only some of the achievements ve have realized in the past few months. They result from close cooperation between the RMIAF and MAAG. It is this type of cooperation which we both must re-emphasize in order to continue our progress toward victory over the Viet Cong guerrillas.
As you know, I am convinced, and I havc repeatedly given assurances to my superiors that the GVU'has the will and determination as well as the ability to achieve victory if provided with'required U.S. support and if ’ GVN accepted and implemented the military and other supporting recoin- . • • mendations contained, in the Counter-Insurgency Flan. I am sure you will agree from recent events that the United States will render the require! support. We both know that there is general acceptance of the CounterInsurgency recommendations in principle on the part of the GVN. However, there are certain specifics regarding their military implementation which *• i ‘ would now like to take up with you, together with some other closely re-la ted MAAG recommendations.
One of the major recommendations of the proposed Counter-Insurgency , ‘ '.Plan was that a. National Internal Security Council be established to promulgate the policy for and to coordinate the preparation and execution of a Viet. namese National Counter-Insurgency Plan, incorporating the political, economic, psychological, and military aspects of that plan. I realise the r ■ .	■	•• •

complexity of this task at the national level and am aware that although certain, existing agencies are capable of working in this field, it will take some time to implement fully this comprehensive- but vitally important . recommendation. I merely wish to invite your attention to the urgent . need for expediting the full activation and operation of such a National Agency.
Another matter of urgency at the present time is that of effective border and coastal surveillance capabilities for Vietnam. As pointed out in the Counter-Insurgency Plan, both of these capabilities require high level coordination and will not be fully implemented until a national agency such as the Internal Security Council is in operation. There are, however, certain portions of the border and coastal surveillance concepts which can be initiated piecemeal. I lmow you will agree that any’ action which can reduce the ability of the Viet Cong to make full use of the land or sea frontiers should be taken as soon as possible. Naturally, MAAG stands ready to vzork with appropriate agencies of the RVNAF to this end.
As you know, a portion of the 20,000 man force increase was devoted to the activation of three separate Infantry Regiments. In recommending these three units, MAAG intended the creation of a badly needcd rotational training base so that regiments from those Infantry Divisions ’ which have, of necessity, been committed to hot war operations for extended periods of time could be rotated for badly needed rest, rehabilitation and retraining in anti-guerrilla tactics. As you know, my superiors approved U.S. support of these Regiments, primarily on my strong personal conviction and consequent recommendation that a rotational capability by Regimental size units was absolutely essential to the adequate and timely training of the RVNAF. There was, ‘and still remains, a critical need for such a rotational training plan, especially in thc three divisions in the III Corps area. These three new regiments have, in fact
• been activated and are training toward operational readiness. However, I am informed that it is now proposed to use them in security roles, one per Corps area. If so, I feel this should be reconsidered, Mr. President, fin light of the most urgent need to improve the combat effectiveness of the combat divisions now committed to firjiting the Viet Cong and especially as the approval of the increase to 170,000 was made contigent on this use of the forces.
' '•	7 mentioned earlier that U.S. advisors are now authorized to ac- .
company AR.VN units on operations down to battalion and separate company level. This is a significant improvement over thc former arrangement, when advisors were not authorized to accompany units into operational

areas except in exceptional circumstances. While I feel that this is a major step forward in the more effective utilization of MAAG advisors, I am concerned that this forward looking authorization is not being fully implemented. The implementing directive (RVNAF Memora-: :dvrt, Num- . ber 563/111/1'3/1, dated 5 May 1961) reserves thc decision as to whether or not MAAG advisors are permitted to accompany units, largely •to ARVN field'co—nanders - based on their estimate of "security limits imposed by battlefield conditions." While I recognize and concur in the concern of the GVii at all levels regarding the security of U.S. military
• personnel, I feel that ARVIi commandert; are often over zealous in their desire to insure the one hundred percent security of MAAG advisors in operational areas - a condition which cannot be attained under current
I circumstances. Of course, I do not wish advisors to engage in actual combat except in self defense. However, I feci th t lack of absolute security measures should not preclude them from performing their mission. In the- future, I am hopeful that ARViI commanders will avail themselves more frequently of the professional competence available to them through HAAG advisory assistance in both the planning and.conduct of tactical operations.
I am convinced that the most fundamental military recommendations contained in the Counter-Insurgency Plan are those pertaining to reorganization of the command structure end a single chain of comand. As you, know, in my military assessment of the situation last September, one of my basic conclusions was tho absolute necessity for a single, inviolate ’ chain of command, which could implement an integrated national plan for counter-insurgency. You will recall our numerous discussions and cen-ferences on this subject prior to your decree 98/QP and thc directives which were derived therefrom. In essence, this important decree resulted in elimination of Military Regions•and placed the three Corps under an operational Field Corarand, charged with the conduct of military operations. Province Chiefs retained certain military responsibilities, however, the DOD directive specifically placed them within the military chain of command for military matters. As you know, HAAG was apprehensive about the retention of Province Chiefs in the military chain of command..' However, ire felt that your decree represented a workable solution and were enthusiastic about the opportunity for improvement in this vital area. In recent weeks, however, during the detailed implementation of these directives soma tendencies have developed which, if not checked, will negate much we are both trying to accomplish, I refer specifically to some instances of violation of the officially established chain of corrani and to diffic.ul.tics in isolating and defining the role of thc Province Chief, as pertains to military affairs.

•	I am sure you agree that the military chain of command, to be
effectivc, must be respected by all - both subordinates and superiors, alike. Confidence in the command structure, is fundamental to military ■ operations and I am convinced that a national plan for counter-insurgency cannot successfully be administered without it. Naturally, if co.renders are bypassed or their orders countermanded, they are unable to make effective plans and it is most difficult to execute successful operations within their assigned areas of responsibility.
Of course, unforseen circumstances will often develop requiring the immediate commitment of security forces in a particular area. Pro.	• vided such a requirement is levied through the normal chain of military
command, the mission can normally be accomplished with, minimum disruption of training, security and operations against the Viet Cong. In this respect, I have received reports recently indicating that major command ielements have been bypassed, both up and down the chain of command.
In this regard, I must also report that in establishing the new drain of military command, in certain cases problems have been encountered in defining the role of the Province Chief within that chain. The directives arc clcar that the Province Chief, in his role of a military commander, is within the military chain of cormsand. However, above and beyond the normal Civil Guard Force which has been assigned to each province, the Province Chief should not automatically assume command of all military units physically present in his province, but should command only those forces allocated to him by his next higher military superior, normally the Division Tactical Zone Commander. This arrangement is, of course, parallel to the system at the Corps level, which seems to be understood by all. For example, the Corps Commander does not command units of the General RVNAF Reserve merely because they are physically present in
• his Corms Tactical Zone. Rather, such units must be allocated by Field Command oj' JGS before the Corns Commander exercises command or control. I feel it essential that the same principle prevail at Province ’	•_ level. While I fully understand the dual capacity of Province Chiefs as
military and civil leaders, I fce.l that this dual position must be brought into harmony with the need for clear-cut command channels and unit
.	• . assignments on the military side. Otherwise, piecemeal assignment, as
. ' already reported, of AEF/ii battalion,'.: .to-Province.Chiefs could well result. • in the conduct of 37 miniature campaigns - cacti one proceeding at its own e
•	pace and intensity, rather than a national campaign against the Viet Cong
•in accordance with a cohesive, coordinated, plan.

• Another area to which I must invite your attention has to do with the _ utilization of the 11-34 helicopter squadron. This aircraft is not a simple item of equipment, and I era fully aware of the complex problems involved •• having to do with maintenance and specialized personnel. However, it is potentially one of the most effective items of equipment in the hands of RVHAF for defeating the Viet Cong. The helicopter provides superior mobility over all types of terrain, and as you know guerrilla warfare is essentially mobile warfare. Increased effort is necessary to expedite the training of troop units in helicopter borne operations. To accomplish this, priority utilization of these aircraft must be given to this training, and to the subsequent use of helicopters on their primary mission of combat operations. During my inspection of the 21st Division Operation in Vinh Binh Province, 27 June, there were only two of the six operational H-34's made available for operations. As you know, these H-3h’s were delivered, ahead of schedule by my government only upon my insistence that they were urgently required for actual hot war military operations. Although these aircraft are being used in important combat support missions, increased operational use of H-34's is required to Justify this earlier delivery.
Also, during my inspection of the 21st Division Operation mentionsd above, I noted an apparent lack of adequate prior planning and coordination between the civil administrative functions of the Province and the military operation. On this seventh day of the military operation, the Commanding General, Field Command, Courmding General, III Corps, the National . Delegate and the Province Chief were holding a meeting to coordinate and resolve problems of a combined politico-military nature. These included the problems such as the movement of villagers and civil control after completion of the military phase. As you recall, the concept of progressive coordinated, phased clearing of the country, spelled out in the CounterInsurgency Plan and the Tactics and Techniques paper, requires a high degree of civic-military coordination in all areas, and particularly in areas where actual fighting is taking place. Ihis is especially important not only prior to and. during the operation, but following it. Active and positive cooperation betwecn the Province administrative authorities and the mili-. tary commanders is essential to ensure a coordinated, pacification of the area plus the all important follow-up and take over by the Province authorities. Only in this way can permanent results be obtained - by denying the Communists re-entry into the area after the operation has been completed. The overall concept of the Province Chief using the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps to perform, this mission is bound but requires close supervision and coordination in each major clearance operation by RVNAF. .

Another element of RVFIAF which has a greater capability for ef- . fective opera-bions against the Viet Cong than, at present is the River Forces of the Vl'iH. Two general problem areas are currently preventing .	■
more effective employment.	•
' The first is the problem of joint planning. The operational commander of the River Force is Commanding General, III Corps. As an Array Commander, he cannot be expected to know the many details of how best to employ the potential combat and. support capabilities of these forces. I feel the solution lies in the establishment of a joint planning section with Naval representation on the Corps staff. Given proper technical advice, the Corps Cojssander could then realize much more effectiveness from the River Forces. •	•	•
The second problem area is support for the River Forces, to in-clv.de additional draft, better priority for maintenance, increased command recognition and assistance v.’ith some acute personnel problems to include officer shortages and an equitable promotion policy within the VNN. Military missions should also be coordinated with civilian requirements for these craft.
. In addition, as indicated in the Vinh Binh operation, better coordination wi.tll respect to the Sea Forces in Joint Operations appears neces-.sary. This coordination should be accomplished at Joint General Staff level. Although some preplanning was accomplished at Joint Staff level, . difficulty was experienced in coordination with the ground operation.
, Another important progressive step was the establishment of three logistic commands, one in each of the‘three Corps areas. This it resulting in the coordination of the six technical services in the field and is producing materially improved logistic support for. the combat forces assigned to the Army Corps. Also, I am pleased to note that the RViLAF Deputy for Logistics, General To, has teen given a. degree of increased
- coordinating authority. However, there still remain many complicated delaying procedures which impair the effectiveness of logistic support to combat units. It appears particularly desirable that some of the ABA fiscal functions be decentralized to permit prompter response to the needs • . • of combat units- .	.
• t 0	.	•
•	•	•	-	•	•	c
Another matter which I consider of sufficient importance to bring to
• your 'personal attention is the irradiate requirement for additional civilian personnel in the technical service depots and other logistic installations.

As of’31 Ity 1961, there was a cumulative shortage of 568 civilian personnel from the 4,821 authorized for the 1-50,000 RViIAF force level. Ko new authorizations have been made to provide the increased capability re- .	.
quired for the 20,000 ma increase and the MAP support of the 68,000	•
Civil Guard force. Additional permanent as well as tempora:ry civilian personnel are most urgently needed so that the technical services will be able to properly receive, account for, store, issue, and maintain the significant tonnages of supplies and equipment scheduled to arrive on an accelerated basis beginning in mid-July. Although an interdepartmental commission has been established to solve this proble:'., little progress has been made in augmenting the civilian technican force. The inability of your technical services to process these supplies could well retard the entire training and supply program. As HAAG has made the urgency of
•	this program its main reason for budgetary recommendations, this must
not happen.	•	•
I know that you share my concern that the officers and Bien of Vietnam’ s military and para-military forces slr ll be well uniformed and equipped as individuals. The transfer of the military clothing factory from its present inadequate quarters on Dai Lo Tran Hung Dao to a more spacious facility in the Quartier Pasteur is a. matter of the greatest urgency. The capacity of the existing uniform factory, 35,000 combat uniforms per month, is entirely inadequate to meet the demand - particularly since the supported forces basis has been greatly increased •• and the shortage will become most critical by mid-July. New power sewing machines have been procured from the U.S. but the modification to the new facility will not be completed until some time af.ter the arrival of these machines in Saigon.
In addition to action already in process, T feel that we must take additional urgent action to solve this problem as soon as possible.
One final major matter I would like to mention has to do with the all important continued improvement of ARVN tactical operations. As a re-su.lt of its responsibility for continuing analysis of operations against the VC, my staff has developed a synthesis of what appear to be recurring t. c ( al mosses .in the preparation for, end the conduct of, tactical operations by GVN forces. I have discussed these from time to time with appropriate RVNAF general officers and shall, of course, continue these discussions in the future. I have also furnished General Ty and General Minh with full , details of the MAAG analysis. There are seven general areas which re" quire the continued attention of all concerned in order to achieve the desired improVement. Briefly stated, they are:

COMMAND ARD CONTROL:
. a 4	N
There appears to be too much delegation of responsibility.and. too • little centralized control of tactical operations. Of course, decontfalii zation in tactical operations is sound practice, if sufficient centralized .control is maintained to ensure active supervision by higher commanders. . Such is not always the case, however, because of a somewhat natural tendency for higher commanders to stay fixed in offices and CP's instead ' of getting out with subordinates to whom control has been delegated, to inspect, supervise, and give guidance needed to take advantage of the developing tactical situation. In this regard, an essential adjunct to strengthening the chain of command is the establishment in the RVNAF of an effective inspection system.
INADEQUATE INTELLIGENCE AND RECONNAISSANCE
Large forces, up to "battalion size, are at times committed without : sufficient knowledge of enemy locations. Consequently, these operations ■ often produce negative results and are wasteful of time, energy and resources. Equally important, as they are non-productive, they are hann-ful to the morale and esprit of the officers and men. Better intelligence . coordination between civil and military intelligence agencies are indicated.
INCOMPLETE PLANNING:
• In many ARVII operations, the planning emphasis appears to be primarily on a scheme of maneuver, with inadequate attention to such other important aspects as sound coordination, teamwork, task organization, fire support, air support, communications, supply and resupply, and administration. Each phase must be thought through and planned for in detail, from the initial reconnaissancc to locate the enemy, to his final destruction. Appropriate planning, units and resources must be allocated to each of these phases if we are to be successful.
USE OF PROVISIONAL TASK FORCES:	■ •	••	.
Operations are too often conducted by makeshift, "provisoire," task forces under a provisional commander, when there are available regular units of appropriate size and composition. A commander who finds an immediate opportunity to gain a victory, properly commits everything at his disposal into battle - often with provisional organizations. Inis, however, should be the exception, not the rule. The reason for units such as
S E C R E T
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
S E C R E T
divisions, regiments and battalions is to -provide a coordinated, smooth functioning team, capable of applying the proper degree of combat power . to fit the specific situation. The com manders of such units, through ' prior training exercises, have developed a team, they know their subordinates personally - they understand the unit’s capabilities and limitations. Such is not normally true with "provisoire" organizations.
OVEREMPHASIS ON TERRAIN OBJECTIVES:
Junior leaders tend to become "fixed" upon a particular terrain objective and there have been instances where opportunities to destroy VC have been lost in order to occupy a terrain objective on schedule.
I The solution lies in increased emphasis on the job of killing Viet Cong.
i Subordinate commanders must be constantly reminded that their primary ‘
; mission is to destroy the Viet Cong who normally hit and then run to avoid ! casualties.
IMPROPER AND INSUFFICIENT USE OF AIR AND ARTILLERY:
Air and Artillery support are weapons the VC do not possess and cannot effectively counter. Their advantages must be exploited to the maximum. In many instances commanders do not adequately plan in
advance for this support. Air support of operations, properly planned, coordinated with the ground forces, and timely executed, provides the
t ground ccmmander extremely effective support. Too often, ground

, J FED, FOR AN. OFFENSIVE SPIRIT:	.
Despite improvement in this area, there is still too much reliance on defensive operations and reaction to Viet Cong initiative rather than . talcing the actual initiative ourselves. The ultimate solution does not lie in "defending against the guerrilla; but in boldly and energetically attacking him. Anti-guerrilla fighters must gain and maintain the initiative and truly become the hunter rather than the hunted. The Viet Cong often retains the initiative, even though we take the offensive. This is because he

strikes unknown out of the jungles, swamps or mountains and then fades
> away again. To prevent this, the HVNAF must penetrate and control
l these Viet Cong safe areas. Although the key to success is the spirit of the offensive, to permit the guerrilla to retain the initiative is to court ultimate defeat. The Vietnamese Forces, to an ever increasing degree, must continue to carry the fight to the enemy, rather than permit him to select the time and place for battle. Larger guerrilla, units must be hit in their assembly areas and. smaller groups must be hunted down and destroyed before they are able to accomplish their mission. This, of
' course, requires improved patrolling and training, a climate of assistance by the population to ensure accurate, timely intelligence, the ultimate in. offensive spirit together with tactical innovation at all levels, and the highest order of small unit leadership. Our current training programs arc oriented in this direction but mud! remains to be done to ensure
: maximum results.	•	•	•
This concludes my discussion, Mr. President. Although we have previously touched on many of these matters in our many discussions, I felt I should review the considerable accomplishments wo have made as a cooperative team, and highlight those areas in which I feel further corrections and improvements are required.
I am confident that, by continuing to work together we can build an efficient fighting force, led by commanders duly invested with adequate com-toand authority, and the fighting capabilities of the Armed Forces of Viet-nara will continue to improve.

NATIONAL SECURITY ACTION MEMORANDUM NO. 65
(Supplement to National Security A tion Memorandum N . 52, dated May 11 1961)
TO:	The Secretary of State
SUBJECT:	Joint Program of Action with the Government of Viet-Nam
Following his review of the "Joint Action Program Proposed by the Viet-Nam-United States Special Financial Groups to President Ngo Dinh Diem and President John F. Kennedy," the President on August 4 made the following decisions:	,
1.	The President agrees with the three basic tenets on which the recommendations contained in the Joint Action Program are based, namely:
a.	Security requirements must, for the present, be given first priority.
b.	Military operations will not achieve lasting results unless economic and social programs are continued and accelerated.
c.	It is in our joint interest to accelerate measures to achieve a self-sustaining economy and a free and peaceful society in Viet-Nam.
2.	The United States will provide equipment and assistance in training for an increase in the armed forces of Viet-Nam from 170,000 to 200,000 men. In order to make this increase as effective as possible, the United States and VietNam should satisfy themselves, before the time when the level of 170,000 is reached, on the following points:
241
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
a.	That there then exists a mutually agreed upon geographically phased strategic plan for bringing Viet-Cong subversion in the Republic of Viet-Nam under control.
b.	That on the basis of such a plan there exists an understanding on the training and use of those 30,000 additional men.
c.	That the rate of increase from 170,000 to 200,000 will be regulated to permit the most efficient absorption and utilization of additional personnel and material in the Vietnamese armed forces with due regard to Viet-Nam's resources.
3.	In view of the fact that the force level of 200,000 will probably not be reached until in 1963, a decision regarding the further increase above 200,000 will be postponed until next year when the question can be re-examined on the basis of the situation at that time. Meanwhile, the build-up in equipment and training of the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps within already agreed levels should'be expedited.
4.	Within the limits of available funds, the United States will provide the external resources required to implement the Joint Action Program, including commodity imports which can be justified and absorbed under the seven criteria of the Joint Action Program (pp. 20-21). The parallel Committees of the United States and Viet-Nam will immediately cooperate in working out target estimates for an import program that will give the United States Government a basis for planning.
5.	In order to direct the resources of Viet-Nam to the highest priority requirements, Viet-Nam should be strongly urged to undertake to generate piasters through the several means spelled out on pp. 22-23 of the Joint Action Program.
6.	Strongly urge early implementation by the Vietnamese of the recommendation regarding tax reform and the principle of a single and realistic rate of exchange.

7.	The Ambassador should make clear to President Diem that if this is to be a truly joint effective effort, action . by each country must be related to that by the other. In particular, the U.S. attaches grant importance to the reasonable implementation of the agreed criteria governing imports; we also consider the gaining of the effective piaster rate applicable to U.S. commodity aid, to which it is understood President Diem has already agreed, to be an indispensable part of our effort. Action by Viet-Nam on both of these matters will be very closely related to thc U.S. contribution to the over-all effort. The Ambassador is authorized to assure President Diem that increased piaster realization per dollars worth of imports will not be used as a reason for reducing the U.S. share of our joint efforts.
8.	The President directs the Director of International Cooporation Administration to conduct through USOM Viet-Nam and in cooperation with appropriate Vietnamese experts, a through and expeditious review of the new proposals for emergency social action outlined in Section B of the Joint Program and of programs already underway which these proposals are intended to supplement.
9.	In order to derive long-range benefits from our joint efforts to win in the present emergency, Viet-Nam needs long-range planning. Accordingly, urge the Vietnamese to create more effective planning machinery to develop a long-range plan and urge them to expedite the training of staff to carry on plat ting activities.* The Parallel Committees should develop specific development projects in line with the general recommendations in the Joint Action Program.
10.	Make clear to Diem that we hope that one consequence of our new joint efforts will be an effective projection to the nation, its friends and its enemies, of our confidence in a long-range
* Such planning activities should, inter alin, cover such particulars as the use of medical manpower and teachers, for which Viet-Nam has competing .civilian-military requirements.
243

future for an independent Viet-Nam. In this connection, the Ambassador should seek discreetly to impress upon President Diem that he should use the total U.S. program for the greatest political effect in his achievement of maximum appreciation of his government by the people of Viet-Nam and the people of the world. (It is hoped that the Ambassador will continue his efforts to persuade President Diem to engage more fully in his civic action program non-Communist elements now in political opposition.)
11.	The Parallel Committee should be given a maximum delegation of authority to assure follow-up action, approve modifications of the program and "recommend measures to improve and adapt the Special Action Program as the situation changes." In this connection, the President has emphasized that the chief responsibility for the planning and execution of the U.S. share of the program will, more than 'ever, rest with the Ambassador and, under his direction, with MAAG and USOM.
12	.The President shall be informed of matters arising in the implementation of this Joint Program requiring his attention so that they may receive his immediate consideration.

PROSPECTS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM
THE PROBLEM
To assess the situations in North and South Vietnam, to analyze the nature and scope of the Communist, threat to South Vietnam, and to estimate the prospects for ( the next year or so.
CONCLUSIONS
J. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) has thoroughly consolidated its i political control in North Vietnam and, with extensive Bloc assistance, will prob-ably continue to make rapid economic i progress. Regimentation and food short-ages have increased public unrest and . dissatisfaction and resulted in some ; slackening of discipline amOng local offi-' cials. However, there is no significant i organized Opposition, The moderating influence of the aged Ho Chi Minh has r -'rented policy differences among top 1 ✓ V leaders from erupting into serious i raparty strife. When Ho is no longer a live there will probably be a struggle for power between the Moscow-oriented aiid the Pciping-bfiented elements of the party. (Paras. 13, 15, 21, 23-25)
2.	There is some dissatisfaction in South Vietnam with Diem’s leadership among members of the cabinet, the bureaucracy, and the military, arising out Of the serious internal security situation and irritation n Die is system of family rule. -Diem
has initiated a number of political reform measures, but probably will not relinquish his highly centralized method of govern-ment control. The degree of dissatisfac- ; tion will probably be directly related to the success or failure of the Government of Vietnam (GVN) efforts against Communist -guerrilla and subversive activity. (Paras. 31, 34, 39)
3.	The army will continue to be a major factor in future political developments in South Vietnam. We believe that the chances of a military coup have been re-duced by recent manifestations' of US support of the Diem government and by the substantial increase in US aid to help-South Vietnam meet its internal security problems. Although there has been a de-crease in indications of coup-plotting within the military in recent months, cer-tain basic dissatisfactions with the na-tional leadership persist. If the fight against the Viet Cong goes poorly during the next year or the South Vietnamese Army suffers heavy casualties, th!

i chanc.es of a military coup would substan-■ tially increase. (Para. 37)
4. A major Hanoi-directed Communist offensive against the Diem government and directed towaid reunification of Viet-nam under Communist control is under way. The Communist apparatus in South Vietnam, the Viet Cong, now probably has more than 12,000 hard-core members and several thousand support ers ' engaged in guerrilla warfare, terrorist
operations, political and propaganda ac-■ tivity, sabotage and intelligence activities.
This campaign is intended to assert. Com-: munist authority over increasingly large । parts of the countryside in anticipation of setting up fully "HEerateci areas” in i which GVN authority is effectively denied, I or cf so weakening the Diem government.
as to precipitate its overthrow, or bOth. ’ At present, more than half of the rural area in the productive and highly populated region south and southwest of Sai-
i gon, as well as several areas to the north-i west of Saigon, are under extensive con-I trol of the Communists. (Paras. 50-51) i
• 5. We believe that the Hanoi regime, will
. increase the pace and scope of its para-■ military activity during the next few • months. South Vietnam’s urban centers
' 'll probably be subjected to increasing ■ let Cong IciToriSm. ■ Further Viet Cong st tempts to assassinate Diem are likely. Howeyer, we believe that with continued high levels of US aid and a strenuous and . effective GVN effort, the problem of Viet
Cong control of large areas of the countryside can in time be reduced. (Paras. 58-60)
G. Even if the GVN does reduce Viet Cong strength, it will require continued maxi-' mum effort—military, political, and cco-nomic—to maintain its authority. South Vietnam will not be able to seal completely its borders with North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to the infiltration of material and personnel from North Vietnam. (Paras. 60-61)
'I. Thus, the outlOok in South Vietnam is for a prolonged and difficult struggle with the Viet Cong insurgents. At the same time that the government is prosecuting the military campaign in the war against the. Communists, it will have to act to pre-vent internal y/eaknesses and strains from causing its collapse. Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese forces already control most of southern Laos* except for towns along the Mekong, and if a Communist or leftist government comes to power in Laos the GVN struggle against the Viet Cong will take on new, more perilous di-mensions. If there is a serious disrup-tion of GVN leadership as a result Of Diem’s death or as the result of a military coup any momentum GVN’s counterin-surgency efforts had achieved will be halted or reversed, at least for a time. The confusion and suspicion attending a coup effort could provide the. Communist an opportunity to seize control of the government. (Paras. 61-62) •

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject: Plan for Military InterVcntion in Laos (C.) The Secretaries of State and Defense have reviewed again the circumstances under which military intervention in Laos might be undertaken, and the form of such action. -Their conclusions are set forth below. .
The Intervention Plan
It is the judgment of the two Secretaries that if the President decides that US forces should be employed in Laos, SEATO Plan Fire, augmented with South Viet Nam and additional Thai forces, iR the proper basic Vehicle for the contemplated action. Along with the initial deployments coordinated action with South Vietnamese, Thai, and Lao forces would be taken to expand Royal Laos GoVernment control oyer additional areas of Laos.	’	•	•	•	•
Circumstances of Initiation
1.	The plan would be initiated upon resumption of obVious •	• . and determined Communist offensive actions -above the scale of
■ ■ Violation of the current cease fire.
. .	2. Initiation of the plan should be considered if large
...... • .
scale enemy military strength and logistic build-up clearly _ • ' ■ ’ • indicates imminent resumption of hostilities.
3.	The Royal Laotian GoVernment would haVe appealed to SEATO for assistance under the Manila Pact of 1954.

4.	An urgent meeting ef the .UN Security Council would have boon requested, to apply pressure on the USSR to establish an effectiVe cease-fire. A resolution would be introduced into the Security Council which would contain the following • elements;	'	' •	■	.
a.	Security Council endorsement of Lao neutrality and territorial integrity,	•

b.	A call to establish an effectiVe cease-fire.
c.	The sending of small UN teams to Laos to be positioned •	’	_ at strategic points throughout Laos.
5.	If such a resolution were Vetoed by the USSR in the Security Council, a move into the UNGA would promptly be made, 6. Simultaneously with the initiation of United Nations action, SEATO would proceed with the necessary measures for .

action on the same basis as that at the time of the Lebanon crisis. It would not exclude public Statements that SEATO • . . . . . — forces would be v/ithdrawn if the United Nations reached agreement on appropriate measures.

a.	Expanding Royal Lao Government control in the strategic "panhandle" of Laos, particularly along its border with South Viet Nam, to prevent the outflanking of the 17th parallel.
b.	Preventing Communist advances to the border of Thailand where they could easily supply and step up their insurgency effort among the Vietnamese ethnic minority in Northern Thailand.
c.	Bringing about a de facto cessation of further Communist thrusts into the territory of the Royal Lao Government•
It would be made clear publicly that the political objective of this military intervention is to stop Communist expansion in Southeast Asia. It would also be made clear that the forces involved would be authorized to take the required action to successfully accomplish this mission. Enemy military actions would not alter the political objective, but such actions could compel military responses not necessarily confined to Laos.
MILITARY OBJECTIVES
1.	To minimize United States military involvement by obtaining increased participation and coordination among the military forces of Laos, Thailand and South Viet Nam.
2.	To protect the borders of South Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambod i a.

Force .Tnvolvement
1.	The combat forces in Laos would number approximately 25,400c men, on a SEATO-augmented banis. US forces in IaoS would be
’ 5,5.00. The remainder of the SEATO forces of approximately 22,700, including 11,000 US air and logistics forces, would be based in Thailand. This does not include U.S Naval forces which may be committed to Support the* operation and a SEATO General RescrVe of 6,000 personnel, none of which is US, retained in the parent country.
2,	The augmentation indicated aboVe consists of one Thai division (11,400) less the units preVidusly conanitted, (3,300) to SEATO under Plan 5 a minimum of one South Viet Nam regimental combat team of 2,700.

Areas of Action and Milltary Tome Phasing	'	..
1. Execute the current SEATO Plan 5, augmented.
’	2. The initial lift of SEATO' forces (other than Thal) would be/
directly into Laos from areas outside Thailand. t .
3.	The areas.to be occupied would initially include key points along the Mekong River; Under present circumstances

. this would, mean as many as possible of the following: Vientiane, Paksane, Thakhek, 'Seno, SaVannakhet, and Pakse. It is not contemplated that the forces -would occupy any area held by opposition forces such as Xieng Khouang or the,Plaine des
Jarres.
4.	Upon the completion of the initial deployments of .SEATO
Plan 5 military actions will be expanded as follows:
a.	Thai augmentation forces will operate in the Sayabouri
ProVince area to include the town of Luang Prabang.
b.	South Vietnamese Forces of a minimum of a Regimental Combat. Teem will operate in Laos along the common border between the two countries.	.
c.	SEATO forces occupying Mekong River areas will support
and assist the Royal Lao Forces in cleaning Communist forces from the areas of Northern Laos bordering Thailand and from
all of Southern Laos (panhandle).
Initial Rules of Engagement.
1.	Short of expanded Viet Minh or Chinese Communist intervention or a broad Pathet-Lao offensive, the forces employed in Laos would occupy and secure the selected areas together with airfields and U.tkong RiVbr’crossings in the Vicinity, They would take counterguerrilla roti on as necessary to protect lines of communication, would preVent harassing action against their position, and would resist any force attacking their
positions,

2.	The SEATO force would furnish material and logistic support to Royal Laos Forces.
3.	The SEATO Farce would participate in offensive operainons against the insurgents by providing Royal Lao and South Vietnamese • Forces.assistance with air support. Including combat air support, communication, psychological warfare and with otncr special operations.	A
Enemy Forces
1.	Insurgents now -n Laos
The insurgents now operating in Laos, consisting of about 31,100 (Kham Ouane/Kong Le forces - 12,000; Pathet Lao forces 15,900; Viet Minh technicians and troops - 3,000) would be capable of harassing, guerrilla-type operatiDns against SEATO forces in Laos. These operations would most likely be directed by North Vietnamese cadres^with North Vietnamese- technical and logistic support and Bloc airlift. Communist insurgent forces employed cotild Vary from platoon-size to several battalions, including medium artillery support. 2'. 1Terth Viet Nam and Communist China

Laos are limited by tonnage capacity, of road routes and air heads. The eight division capability, is based on a 120 short ton per day divisional requirement (10,500 men per division). This represents the maximum capability during the dry season. During the rainy season the Communist capability would be reduced to introducing approx! mately five light regimental units. Communist logistic air ' support would be limited by airfield capacities.	• '
b.	The question of open counterintervention by Communist ' . .	-	o
]3loc forces is in large part dependent upon ..the manner and the circumstances under which SEATO forces are introduced in Laos. The communists might well react simply with a political and diplomatic campaign to force withdrawal of SEATO forces. If counterinterVention did occur, the Communists vzould be unlikely, at least initially, to seek direct engagement of SEATO forces with regular North Vietnamese or -Chinese Communist forces, although there probably would be guerrilla harassment using volunteers" or unacknowlcdged forceo to supplement the insurgents now in Laos.

ABSTRACT
Since late 1959 the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) has been faced with greatly accelerated, diversified, and unremitting Communist guerrilla and terrorist warfare and subversion directed and supported by the North Vietnamese regime. During this.period the armed component of the Communist apparatus has grown from 3,COO cadres to a wcll-organizon, ade-• quatety armed, and increasingly aggressive guerrilla-terrorist force of about 17,000 as a result of stepped-up infiltration and recruitment locally, Although Communist armed operations are concentrated in the rural areas of the. Mekong River delta, they have, spread to the once relatively quiescent central and northern provinces and have occurred increasingly closer to urban areas. The immediate Communist objectives are to demoralize the peasantry, weaken and supplant government authority in the countryside, (' and discredit President Ngo Dinh Diem’s leadership to the point of precipi-V tatihg his overthrow.
Cotemunist progress toward these objectives has been substantial. Flore than one-half of the entire countryside in the highly productive Mekong River delta, as well as some areas north of Saigon and in the central provinces, have come under varying degrees of Communist control. In many of these and other areas, the Communists, have restricted the flow of rice to the marketing centers, forced the curtailment of government agrarian and other rural programs, and gained control of many inland . Waterways, thereby adversely effecting the economy. Since the beginning of 1960, Communist guerrillas and terrorists love killed or kidnapped more than 6,500 civilians, local officials, and security and military personnel, thus increasing the shortage of trained local admi nistrators ••	. and weakening morale particularly among the security services and the
local civil bureaucracy. Moreover, in the face of the government’s inability to provide adequate protection to the popularb in many rural areas, Communist reprisals and propaganda have aggravated peasant t; *, dissatisfaction, an! have made the peasantry reluctant to participate in ■ local govern’-ant projects and to assist the security forces with vitally
. needed intelligence on the Communists,

The domestic political repercussions of the Co: munist insurgency have also been severe. Numerous officials at all levels of the government and the military and security establishmonts have criticized Dien's ’ handling of the security situation and have seriously questioned his_ ability to lead the people during what they regard as the most critical period since the encl of the Indochina war. Their concern with the Commu-. nist threat,, however, is almost inseparably entwined with an accumulation of grievances principally over Diem’s failure to delegate responsibility, the power exercised by members of Diem’s family, and Dien’s methods of policing the attitudes and loyalty of the government bureaucracy. Open deprecation of Diem’s leadership on these and other grounds has also increased sharply among intellectual-elite circles and disgruntled c-x--politicians in Saigon, largely a politically impotent however vocal lot, and to a. lesser extent, among labor and business elements..
Piecent developments- -including Diem’s outstanding success at the presidential polls last April and some modest political reforms to date but, more importantly, strong US public manifestations of support and a substantial increase in US military and economic aid-—have given Diem something of a political reprieve, However, the-political situation remains fluid and, .as yet, there has been no conclusive reversal of deteriorating trends, Although reports of coup-plotting and of criticism of Diem have decreased in recent months, their persistence is indicative of the continuing and potentially explosive political situation in South Vietnam. Moreover, below the surface of open discontent, there is probably a growing and increasingly desperate clement of dissenters who are silent either because of fear of being suppressed or because of the realization that there is little they can do legally to improve conditions. '
Neither has there been any conclusive, improvement in the security situation although the government’s comprehensive counterinsurgency program, supported by substantial US aid, is beginning to show favorable results,. The Communists can be expected to maintain a pressing and diversified campaign of guerrilla-terrorist and subversive warfare, and there are strong indications they will attempt a greater armed effort after the end of the rainy season later this year; however, they may continue to avoid any large-scale engagement with the increasingly aggressive Vietnamese, army, except in places and . at times of their own choosing. In the short run, the Communist apparatus , does not appear to have the. capacity to foment a large-scale insurrection or . to .seize control of the government without considerable assistance from North Vietnam, which would necessarily be of such magnitude that it would be tantamount to overt military aggression. Parring such a development■and given effective implementation of• the counterinsurgency plan, the government should ba able to reduce som.cwhat the level of Communist insurgency during the next year or so and conceivably even reverse the trend against ths Coe'mists.

Security prospects over the next year, however, may well be influenced more by developments in neighboring Laos than by the extent to which the Diem government can improve the effectiveness of its military and security forces. If Laos comes under predominantly Communist control, Communist capabilities in South Vietnam would almost certainly be strengthened to a degree unprecdented since 1954. • Southern Laos could become the most important base for Communist operations against South Vietnam. In this event, the level of Communist insurgency might assume the proportions of widespread guerrilla warfare and some areas would probably come under complete Communist control, within which Hanoi might attempt to establish a Coraminist but ostensibly independent government’ with both military and political support from the Bloc, Vietnam's agricultural economy would suffer further and urban centers probably would be increasingly subjected to Communist guerrilla and terrorist attacks designed to heighten anxiety in the centers of government power and spark a non-Communist coup effort.
In the face of a Communist offensive of such proportions, South Vietnam would be required to make a maximum military effort in order to survive. There would be no immediate collapse. In the long run, however, the maintenance of South Vietnam's independence would rest principally on the nature and amount of US support and on a maximum effort by the South Vietnamese G-vernment to develop the political, psychological, and economic programs required to gain and retain popular support.
The stability of the government during the next year or so, will depend principally on Diem's handling of the security situation. If Diem can demonstrate a continuing improvement in security conditions, he should be able to strengthen his position, alleviate concern and boost morale within his bureaucracy and military establishment, and lessen the urgency with which many of the members view the current situation. However, if the fight against the Communi goes poorly or the South Vietnamese Army suffers heavy casualties, the chances of a coup would substantially increase. Moreover, a coup may be attempted at any time. The odds favor a coup if security declines appreciably further, particularly if accompanied by a virtual Communist takeover of Laos.
Any coup attempt during the next year or so is likely to be non-Commi in leadership, involving army elements and civilian officials and perhaps some disgruntled oppositionists cutside the government. The participating elements probably would be broader than those involved in the 1960 attempt, would have greater popular support, and would be better prepared to execute their plan quickly and successfully. Moreover, a major split within the military leadership does not appear likely; most of the generals probably would elect to remain uncommiit< at the outset of the coup, as they apparently did in November 1960, adding their tacit or active support to whatever side they judged likely to win. Under these circumstances, a military coup attempt would have better than an even chance to succeed.
Diem's removal—whether by a military from accidental or natural causes--would of the military . The odds appear about
coup, assassination death, considerably strengthen the power even between a movement led by

military junta or by Vice President Tho, with the army playing a major if not the predominant role behind the scene?. On the one hand, the military might conclude that a military-led government would be better able to maintain national unity and internal political cohesion and, more importantly, to conduct a determined and effective campaign against the Communists. On the other hand, they might conclude that Tho, who has been on good terms with some of the present military leaders, would not disagree with their views on the manner of conducting the fight against the Communists and that his constitutional succession would legalize the change in government and avert a serious power struggle. Another important factor which would almost certainly enter into the calculations of the military would be the fortunes of the coup group in South Korea and the course of US-ROK relations. In any event, a government led by the military, by Tho, or by any other civilian approved by the military would probably maintain Vietnam's pro-US orientation.
If a military coup or Diem's death seriously disrupted government leadership, any momentum the government's counterinsurgency efforts had achieved probably would be halted.and possibly reversed, at least for a time. Moreover, the confusion and suspicion attending the disruption would provide the Communists an opportunity to strengthen their position in the countryside, and they might even be emboldened to attempt to seize control of the government. Since a serious split within the military leadership does not appear likely, Communist attempts to take oi/er the government in Saigon would probably fail.
In the meantime, the Diem government will almost certainly continue to press for increased, aid, further expansion of the armed forces, and a clear priority of military over political and economic efforts to undercut the Communist insurgency. Diem will be adamant in his views as to how the anti-Cotnmunist campaign should be waged and will tend to regard US differences with such views or criticism of his inner circle as indications of weakening US confidence in him. In the event of another coup effort against him, he would probably expect quick and strong US public support. Diem will also continue to press the US for a strong anti-communist posture in the Far East. If he concludes that this posture is weakening, he will almost certainly make strong protests and become increasingly assertive and stubborn in his relations with the US. However, in the absence of any acceptable alternative to US support and assistance to South Vietnam, he is likely to avoid jeopardizing seriously basic US-South Vietnamese tics. Indeed, he would probably seek to establish closer ties with the US by such means as a mutual defense treaty and possibly the stationing of US forces in South Vietnam if, for example, the Communists take over Laos or’Communist China achieves a nuclear capability. Failure of current international efforts to establish a neutral Laos or a resumption of all-out rebel military operations in Laos would greatly tempt Diem to increase substantially his covert forces in sout! Laos in order to prevent complete C '	rol of that area; Diem would probably seek US-Thai
participation as well as assurances that the US defend South Vietnam in case such action precipitated opeh aggression by North. Vietnam. Diem would also be tempted to involve his gove ‘ in t nother plot to overthrow Norodom Sihanouk in the event the latter became too accommodating to impending Communist pressure in the area,

The deterioration of the security and political situations has contributed to some deceleration in the pace of economic growthe Expansion in both tho agricultural and industrial sectors has continued, honever, and the South Vietnamese people remain, if not prosperous, at least relatively well-off' in terms of Southeast Asian living standardsc Nonetheless, the economy is still heavily dependent on US aid, and there is the greying fear that much of the economic progress achieved'to date my be undone by the Communists whose efforts in this direction give testimony • of a mo.jor objeo” tive.
In foreign affairs, the South Vietnamese G-overnment has sought to maintain its close ties With the US but, until recently, Diem and some of his top advisors have been critical and resentful, of many urgent US recont" mentations and even doubtful of US political support for their regime. During the past feu months, a clear and public reaffirmation of US support and increased US assistance, on the one hand, and on the. other, Diem’s willingness to push ahead more vigorously with expanded measures to fight the Co'emmtsts have provided a basis for a continuing close relationship between the US and South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese Governmentts most urgent concern, however, has bean with the crisis in neighboring Laos. Communist insurgent forces and capabilities in South Vietnam have bean appreciably strengthened by infiltration across the Lao frontier, and the South Vicitnamese Government is extremely alarmed at the prospects of a Communist takeover of Laos. In the South Vietnamese Government’s view, Cc-munist activities in Laos are part of a broader and coordinated DRV offensive aimed at South Vietnam, and a Communist takeover of Laos would quickly result in a Coirgunist encirclement of South Vietnam since neighboring Cambodia would be unable or vetwilling to resist Communist encroachment.

_ or the former Cochinchina area, were carried out by a few or several armed cadres, and were aimed principally at local administrative officials, police and security personnel, and village leaders. within a year, howeverj it Was clear that the Communist leadership in Hanoi was conducting a planned and increasingly diversified, although still low-level, armed campaign in South Vietnam, coordinated with stepped-up propaganda and other non-violent subversive activities and designed to weaken security and government authority in rural areas and	the pousanti’y, In addition to the conti-oing
rise in terrorist incidents, the number of guerrilla raids against’small security and anry units and remote villages increased, reflecting greater Communist armed capabilities and aggressiveness. Vietnamese intelligence sources; however, estimated the armed component of the Communist apparatus at just over 2,000 which included some remnant armed bands of the once-powerful Cao Rai and Hoa Hao religious sects and of the Binh Xuven bandit organization. Dy the end of 1959, estimated Communist armed strength reached 3,000, with a proportionate increase in the size of attacking guerrilla bands. During this period, Communist terrorists are believed to have assassinated or kidnapped a total of at least 1,100 persons, in addition to the number of military and security personnel killed during armed operations.2	: -
3.	Present Phase., Since the latter part of 1959, the Communist • • apparatus has waged an. intensive and considerably expanded terrorist-guerrilla offensive in South Vietnam, supported by increasingly effective propaganda and intelligence operations. Terrorist acts against local officials and civilians and guerrilla raids against army and security units have increased to levels unprecedented since the end of the Indochina war. The number of persons assassinated and kidnapped during 1960 alone is more than double; the total for 1957-59, Communist armed strength has more than quintri pled, substantial parts of the countryside have come under varying degrees of Communist • control and political influence, travel thoughou.t most of the countryside has become extremely hazardous, and terrorist acts in Saigon itself have increased.

Because of geographic, logistical, and other considerations, Co:— n-nist.actxvi.ties are concentrated, as in the past, in the highly poonlated and productive former Cochinchina region. ..The terrain, most of which is avtamp, as in the Mekong River delta, or virtually jungle*; as- along the Cambodian frontier, has favored Edt-cnd-run tactics and infiltration from (and regroupmsnt in) Cambodia. Since the latter part of 1960, however, the-'Communists Have steppad up substantially their armed operations in the once relatively quiescent central and northern provinces. While this may be partly a tactical manueve-r to relieve increasing government pressure on Coirmtmist forces in the southern proVinces, the Conaunist leadership may be in the process of opening a second major l;ITont" in an area v.'hera the prospects of infiltrating cadres from neighboring southern . Luos have become store favorable than ever before., In any event, the size of Communist forces in the central and northern provinces, has increased greatly, and Communist capabilities there are likely to improve still further. Other infiltration routes are across the Demilitarized Zone along the l7th parallel and by junk landings along South Vietnam’s long coastline.	’	'	'■	, *
Judging ’from their actions and from alleged secret directives from Hanoi, the Communists appear to'be. aiming at isolating as much of the countryside as possible from urban centers (as they were able to do to a considerable extent during the Indochina hostilities), hoping to weaken the government and utlimateIy precipitate its overthrow. The plan apparently Ions teen to build up sufficient armed strength in relatively : inaccessible areas (including areas under Communist influence since 1954) . whore-cadres could rest, train, and regroup and from which operations could be launched, The Communists presumably, hope that the number and size of these areas could :be progressively increased and that they could eventually become completely Conmuni st- control l.ed and strong enough to resist attack by government forces. By Cot.munist definition, they would then constitute "liberated" areas. Since about the riddle part of this year, however, Communist guerrilla and terrorist attacks have occurred closer to urt..n areas than ever before, and tvo provincial capitals have been’attacked and held temporarily. •	■	'	✓ *:

establishments have also increased. In rural areas, the Communists have attempted to subvert local government projects and inspire anti-government demonstrations and have undertaken major campaigns to gain control over the tribal minorities and to aggravate economic conditions,
13.	Conmamist..AcSSmtif lFints
Communist successes since the beginning of .1960 have been high. Probably the. most significant gain has been the spread of Communint control and influence over increasing sectors of the countryside largely through organized coercion and terrorism, The numbar of Communist cadres and conVerts is probably small in most villages, but in the absence of government forces sufficient to protect the village against reprisals, those inclined to support the government and turn against the Communists are effectively contained. The high rate of assassinations of local officials and retaliatory murders, moreover, is a continual reminder of the penalty of noncooperation with the local Communist forces.
Although, the Communist armed-political, apparatus does not appear to have succeeded in completely supplanting the government over any sizeable area, it is believed that more than one-half of the entire rural region south and southwest of Saigon, as well as several areas just to the north and in the central provinces, way be under substantial Communist control by night, with the government generally capable of maintaining its authority only by day. However, in some of these areas (for example, portions of the Ca Hau peninsula, and of the suaEipy Plaine des Joncs), the Communists have benefitted from the extended absence of sufficient government military and security forces and reportedly exercise considerable control by day as Well as by night, Moreover, these areas are believed, to be dangerously close to becoming ’‘liberated” areas, the Communists frequently being reported levying and collecting taxes, directing the harvesting and controlling the distribution of rice and other farm products, conducting indoctrination programs on the populace, conscripting cadres, and setting up overt party organizations and provisional local government units similar to those established during the Indochina fighting. ■	.
Another highly significant gain by the Communist network hag baen the sharp increase in the site and in the armed capability of its guerrillaterrorist force. . Total armed strength is now estimated at about 17,000 and the number of political agents, although still unlmoun, probably has also increased. Ths bulk of the Communist armed force is still distributed in the southern region, despite the substantial increase of forces in the rest of the country. The total numerical increase, in strength, .which is due both to stepped-up infiltration and recruitment locally, enabled the Communists during most of 1960 to operate frequently in large.bands and on several occasions of several hundred'armed personnel, e.g., during the , attack on an army regimental headquarters in Tay Ninh in January 1960

* 1 and the series of attacks against army and other govermsht outposts in tho Koatum- Pleilm area in Ootsus? lOcZl Since the beginning of this year, Communist guerrillas have generally operated in smaller bands, making it more difficult for government forces to find.and .engage then.. However, a series of attacks principally against oecnrity forces this month has reportedly involved about 1,000 Cos-muni st personnel,
■ ■ u .	'	■ ■
.	. The’ capture of weapons and equipmcnt has significantly improved
Communist armed capability. Communist bands appear io be adequately ai’med with a variety of small weapons, frequently utilise light machine-guns and mortars and occasionally rocket launchers and recoilless rilles, and are becoming increasingly adept in the manufacture and use of land mines and other explosive: During some engagements, Communist-guerrillas have, been reported wearing South Vietnamese military uniforms, complete with steel heJmets, utilising night flares, land vehicles, and' motor-boats, and being aided by radio communications.
The casualties inflicted by Communist terrorists and guerrillas have been heavy. According to inco.Tplete official Vietnamese statistics, Communist terrorists assassinated about 2,000 local officials and civilians and Hdnapped almost another 1,800 from January 1960 through June 1961, while Communist guerrillas killed about 2,700 military ana sec unity personnel during armed engagements from May 1960 through June 1961. In comparison, the government claims that about 19;000-20,000 Communists have been killed or captured during I960 and the.first half of this year, but this estimate appears exaggerated. In any event, the casualties inflicted by the Communists have been sufficient to aggravate the existing shortage of experienced J.ocal government officials, weaken morale particularly among the local bureaucracy and the security services, and foment peasant discontent. ’	’	;	■ . •	. - "
The effects of the Ccmnunist guerrilla-terrorist campaign in the countryside has been severe in other respects, Government operations in many areas have been constantly harassed and in some instances have been indefinitely suspended. For example, approximately 200 elementary schools in the south and southwest, affecting about l?,0CO students and 800' teachers, had closed down last .year, and it is now believed that the number of schools inoperative because of the insurgency is about 300c Certain land development operations in the central provinces have been reduced by ’al';ost 'fifty percent, and Comtrnist. attempts to disrupt the economy have caused a. shortara tri the amount of rice available for export and have contributed to a rise in rice prices. Sabotage has increased substantially; by the first quarter of 1961, for example, about 250 bridges had Lean partially or totally destroyed by the Communists. Finally, an increasing rued er of inland i/atsrways in the Mekong delta area, particularly minor canals leading to major waterways, have coma under Communist control.

C. Government Countermeasures	• '	•	•
. Increased Communist activities have required the government to *	■
adopt extraordinary internal security measures which cone close to
.. _ constituting a national emergency. The great bulk of its military, security, and police forces has been employed directly or indirectly in counterinsurgency operations since the beginning of 1960, and these forces are being increased substantially: the 158,000-ran defense establishment (with an army of about 140,000) is being increased to 170,0.00 and eventually to 200,000; the Civil Guard, in effect a paramilitary security and police force, Ls been increased from 48,000 to about 65,000 and eventually to about 70,000; and the Self-Defense Corps, a village constabulary force, has been increased from about 40,COO to 51,000. The regular police services, the Municipal Police and the National Stretd, have remained at about their previous levels of 10,500 and 7,500 respectively. Assisting the military establishment and the security and police services are a number of other groups such as the 'small Gendarmerie, the Self-Defense Corps Youth, and the Republican Youth, the latter being . essentially a political organization but recently armed for defensive purposes.
p'	With the help of US advisors and with increased US aid, the South
Vietnamese Government has proceeded to implement a broad and comprehensive counterinsurgency plan designed to strengthen its military and security capabilities as Well as improve related political, economic, and social conditions. Among the many military-security measures already enacted (some of which had been implemented prior to the formulation of the counterinsurgency plan), the government has accelerated significantly a • training program in anti-guerrilla warfare for its military and security services, increased substantially the number of army “ranger” units to be formed by the. personnel trained under this program, reorganized the army’s tactical, comand structure in order to increase the effectiveness of field operations, improved military communication and transportation • 'ilities, centralized the intelligence functions of most if not all ■	''. mcies, and created a high-level advisory council for security affairs.
...
These measures have increased the effectiveness of the government’s military and security forces to the point that they have been able since . * the first- part -of this year to take more offensive action against Communist guerrillas than ever before. Moreover, several unprecedentedly large opera-• tions, involving elements of the three military services, nave been launched since last June principally in southern areas cf considerable Couaunist armed strength. .While these operations have significantly improved the ability of the military services to carry out coordinatcd offcnsivos, in only three operations have tl a t’j numerically superior forces been able to inflict heavy casualties on the Communist guerrillas.

III. THE POLITICAL SITUATION ■ * 1
A • SlieilltiLeftl;® -Dietti Government
President Diem’s leadership and the stability of his government have boon more seriously questioned during the past year or so than at any time since he consolidated his authority in 1955-56. Since the beginning of 1960, critl.eism of Diem has itlcreased substantially in various sectors of tha Vietnamese society but has been moro urgently articulated within the government bureaucracy itself, including the military establishment. A wide range of officials including Vice President Nguyen Egos Tho and other important members of the cabinet, the bureaucracy, and the military have privately questioned Dien’s handling of the internal security problem and his ability to rally and lead the people against the Communists during what they regard as the most critical period since the end of ths Indochina vtar. Their concern with tho Communist threat, however, is almost inseparably entwined With an accumulation of grievances principally over Diem’s failure to delegate responsibility, the power .exercised by some of Diem’s close advisors, particularly his brother Kgo Dinh Nhu, and the use of the Can lac, the government’s semicovert political apparatus, to police the attitudes and loyalty of the government bureaucracy. Tills discontent culminated in a ncar-■ successful military coup effort in Saigon in November 1960,
Open deprecation of Diem’s leadership has increased sharply among intellectual-elite circles and disgruntled ex-politicians in Saigon, tho focal point of non-Communist'political opposition to Dien since 1956, and to a lesser extent, among labor and business' elements. They have consistently and, on occasion, vociferously demanded that Diem liberalize and reform the regime, lift restrictions on civil liberties, and permit an opposition to operate. These demands have been supported by a disparate group of anti-Diem Vietnamese expatriates in Paris Who "have long advocated Hem’s removal. There is little likelihood, however, that the activities ' .C the Saigon opposition will contribute appreciably to any immediate i /litical crisis in’ South Vietnam, Their.leaders are largely opportunists and political idealists with political vieus covering a wide spectrum, including neutralist. They are not believed to have support within the tipper echelon of the governs;cut, have little popular appeal outside Saigon •and expatriate Eiotnsr.ese communities', and have been consistently unable to maintain unity within their own ranks or to agree on a principal leader or spokesman, A number of then were involved in coup attempt last year, but there is no reliable evidence that they had entered into any close planning or understanding with the military coup leaders.

Until this period, few high or middle level officials dared to
-■ .criticise Item, or any member of the ruling family or to attach the Can Mo even privately, while nom-Communist anti-Diem elements outside the go eernrr.snt had limited themselves almost entirely to guarded expressions Ct. dissent. Diem had heretofore not hesitated to remove any critical, offio.al, including cabinet members and military leaders, or to use the government1s varied resources to pressure and otherwise silence grumblers outside tho government. Fear of unfavorable reaction from the US and of precipitating greater active opposition probably has kept Diem front dismissing critics within his official family and, with exception of those involved in last year coup attempt, from suppressing anti—government activities among Saigon intellectuals and ex-bureaucrats.
Unrest has.also increased among the peasantry principally because
of the gen’ernment's inability to assure adequate protection from depredations and taxation by the Communist guerrillas and terrorists but partly bccausc of the cumulative effort of excessive and roughshod methods by local security and administrative officials* Although dissatisfaction in the countryside is difficult to measure because of the peasantry’s traditional political apathy and suspicion of government, it does not appear to be Widespread. It is probably limited to areas where the level of
.Cpitaunist insurgency and the excesses of government control are highest, and would probably be alleviated by a general improvement in the security situation and by less government coercion. Some recent reports indicate that a trend in this direction is already noticeable due to the increased effectiveness of military and security forces, suspension of forced labor practices, and greater government effort to discipline and remove corrupt, harsh, and unpopular local officials. If these problems are not dealt with effectively, rural discontent nay in the long run develop as the principal source of political instability. In the short run, neither the government nor tho. Communists seem capable of building up a ground-snell of, positive popular support among the peasantry or .using it extensively as a.militant force. .	... t ' .......
The impact of these developments on the Vietnamese military
establishment, however, appears to be much more serious.. From senior down through junior officer ranks, there has been a growing concern over tho course of the fighting against the Communists. Morale particularly among junior and middle grade officers and non-d—'missioned personnel has suffered further 0ror.i extensive co—i,'ant' without sufficient rotation in the seBw.ingly endless pursuit of the Co:—unists under the most adverse conditions of guerrilla warfare. A fairly recent unconfirmed report has alleged growing neutralist sontimsnt among the junior army officers. The concern of a significant sene-ent of the top military leaders’ tip is further aggravated by Diceps reluctance io permit them a greater role in the planning of operations against the Communists, by his frequent disregard of the regular channels of cc-rand, and by the activities of the Can Lao

B.	Pieris. Attitude	’	.
President Diem's reaction toward the current crisis reflects both general optimism and serious concern. Dien's attitude apparently continues to be shaped by the basic premise that tho overriding problem is the Communist threat which he believes can be met virtually by .military measures alone. He is inclined to view criticism of his system of rule, "whether emanating from the bureaucracy or iron the political opposition on the outsidey as being substantially less important presumably because he feels that such criticism is either CoEmunist-inspired or, to the degree that it is legitimate, is stimulated by concern over the Cosmiunist danger Which he seems confident he can counter with increased US aid. In addition, he probably feels confident of his ability to forestall or suppress any armed 1 coup attempt against him,
Equally important, however, is Diem's basic impatience with demo-— cratic processes which he considers useful as ultimate goals but liable ! in a country such as South Vietnam to be wasteful and dangerous to political stability and public safety. Diem appears to hold, therefore, that Vietnamese, with their national survival at stako, must learn to submit to a collective discipline until they develop a better sense of civic responsibility. For these and other reasons, Diem .has not only given low priority to expanding democratic processes but he has also been disdainful and even suspicious of most Vietnamese who have agitated for political reforms. Dien’s convictions of the correctness of his political views and of his approach to the current situation probably have been strengthened by a series of recent developments, including his suppression of last year’s revolt, his easy victory during the elections last April, and the strong US public reaffirmations of support.

of last May to remove some of its critical (but admittedly weak) members; he has increased .the authority of officials helpful to him during the 1960 coup attempt, as in the case of Brig. Gen, Nguyen Khanh; and ho hap established a "political commissar" system in the armed services ostensibly to conduct political indoctrination programs but probably also to strengthen Diem's informant and control mechanism, According to recent reports, Diem has created a ’Military Task Force" of trusted military leaders and units Which would be prepared to move quickly against any attempted coup,
At the same time, Diem appears to have realized that some.'liberalization of llis pr evasive personal role in running tho government is necessary. To date, Diem’s political reforms have been modest arid appear to be motivated
• more by practical considerations, i.e, persistent US urging and increased US aid, than by any change in his political convictions. Among other things, he has permitted the "election’1 of youth representatives to village councils in a number of southern provinces, though the representatives come from the government’s Republican Youth Organization. He has sought to improve the quality of local government officials and has disciplined and removed (with adequate publicity) an increasing number of those guilty of graft, excessive harshness, and ineffectiveness in office. He has allowed (probably ordered) ths National Assembly to indulge in slightly more open delate of government-sponsored legislation and occasionally to question publicly cabinet members on the operation of their departments. Restrictions over the press have teen relaxed somewhat and, with the exception of those involved in last year’s coup attempt, the opposition has not been actively harassed. Finally, he has made a number of administrative’ changes within ths military establishment designed to improve its effectiveness and ostensibly to delegate greater authority to its hierarchy.

Its principal and consistent members have been Diem's own family: Ego Dinh ‘ Nhu, who is officially political advisor to-Diem; Ngo Dinh Can, who has no official status but is the political boss of the central and northern •	•
provinces; Ego Dinh Thuc, who is one .of three Ronan Catholic archbishops in South Vietnam but holds no official position in the government; and probably Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, Diem’s sister-in-law and a member of the National Assembly, whose influence is now difficult to judge in view of Diem’s recent efforts to impress the government and the public with her absence from the inner circle in order to counter sharp criticism of her activities. Outside the Diem family, membership in the inner circle has changed from time to time and currently includes Nguyen Dinh Thuan, Secretary of State for the Presidency, and Brig. Gcn. Nguyen Khanh, Chief of Staff of the Army. Vice President Nguyen Mgoc Tho’s position within . the inner circle is no longer clear in vicw of his known criticism of •
Diem and the mutual dislike between him and Nhu,
Control over the implementation of policies' outside the inner circle appears to be maintained by the Cen L-o and by the large bureaucracy of local officials. Headed by Diem’s brothers, Nhu and Can, the Can Ino also serves as a surveillance Lmchanisu both within and outside the government. Its trusted and carefully selected members are placed at every echelon of government, including the military establishment and the police and security services, and frequently exercise greater auth city than their non-party superiors. The power of the Can Lao outside the government bureaucracy is further enhanced by its direction of the government’s mass political party, the National Revolutionary Movement, by its influence over other pro-government political organizations and ■labor, social, and cultural groups, and by its illegal control of certain economic activities. The importance of the local government bureaucracy for controlling policy implementation is derived from the fact that practically all officials at all levels, from the region down to the village, are appointed and removed directly or' indirectly by the central government and frequently by Diem personally. These officials tend to
,	< c cerate essentially as Diem’s personal agents, particularly the province’ • ' •

D. Elections and Cabinet Reorrani zation
. President. Diem and Vice President Tho were returned to office for another five years by an outstanding majority (89 perceht) of tha vote cast in the presidential and vice presidential elections of April 9, 1961, the first under Victnats constitution.! However, rather than constituting . an accurate bsrometev of support for the nation?..! lcaderaldp, Diem’s easy victory at the polls was due largcly to the overWhalmi.ng advantages accruing from his utilisation of the vast government bureaucracy, including tho military and security establishments, the virtual political nullity of the opposition candidates, and the failure or inability of ths Communists network to exercise i ts ritexiwum armed and other subversive • capabilities during thc brief electoral period.	..	v
There .is no reliable evidence of extensive, government interference in the actual voting or manipulation of the ballots, and Diem made considerable effort to give impression that the elections were free. Among other things, he perra.i'ted extensive coverage and observation of the campaign and of the voting by foreign and Vietnamese correspondents, campaigned extensively even in provinces where Communist activities.were fairly intensive (partly in order to show that he was actively seeking tho office),, and reportedly instructed his officials and agents to concentrate their efforts on an effective campaign and on providing .adequate internal security during the voting rather than on intimidating the opposition candidates. This nay have been due to Dien’s expectation of an easy victory and to his desire to counter Western criticism of his authoritarian rule. Nevertheless, the elections were obviously closely controlled by the government. The national and local bureaucracy, including the almost 300,000 military, police, and security personnel, the equally large political -• party appa-ratus, and the propaganda media, including the government-controlled radio and press, Were monopolized by tho government in waging its campaign, instructing the voters how and apparently for whom to vote and seeing to . it that the voters actually voted. .	• • .

The four opposition candidates (there were two opposition tickets, with two candidates, on each ticket) would have hod little chance of winning even if the elections hod been completely free. They had no notable popular appeal of their own in or outside official circles and were not among the most vocal, articulate, or well-known critics of the government.

E. Political Reprieve for Diem
I
Recent developments appear to have given--President Diem something of a political reprieve. Diem’s outstanding success at the polls last April, however questionable, probably deflated soma of his critics, while the modest political reforms .implemented to date nay have given others some hope of further liberalisation of the regime, However, what lessening of the sense of urgency over the crisis in South Vietnam has taken place, r /I there almost certainly has been some, can be attributed principally
•	strong US’ public manifistations of support for the Diem government, .0lading Vice President Johnson’s visit, and to the substantial increase in IB aid to help South Vietnam defeat the Communist insurgents. Moreover, the reorganizations within the military establishment and the degree of
’ tactical -planning, permitted ths military leadership appear to have alleviated dissatisfaction somewhat within the upper echelon of the armed
•	forces, while the recent large offensive operations against the Commurlists have presumably improved morale amonv the middle and lower echelons.
At best, however, the political, situation remains highly fluid and, as yet, there has been no conclusive reversal of deteriorating trends. Although retorts of coup-plotting and of dissatisfaction with Diem’s leadership have decreased in recent months, their persistence is

Having passed the period when emergency action was required to meet critical economic problems, the'South Vietnamese government has since about 1959 given greater attention to future economic developmentc Progress in this direction has been tangible despite ths continuing priority given to defense and security needs, the effects of Ccmunist insurgency in the countryside, and the precarious political situation. The economy, with about 80% of the people employed in agriculture, is self-sufficient in food, the population-land ratio is still relatively favorable, and cultivable lands are still available. Approximately 7 million acres (about 6 million acres in rice), 17/ of ths national area, are under permanent cultivation, perhaps as much as an additional 20% of the country is potentially productive, and the average peasant land-holding is about five acres.	...	A
Although ths government’s outlook is influenced by a felt need to compete in economic as well as political terms with North Vietnam, it has not been disposed to grant priority to long-range programs of modernization, industrialization, and economic growth. Instead, it continues to regard economic, improvements as feasible and desirable only to the extent that they contribute to or at least do not detract from current defense strength. The maintenance of the military and security establishment continues therefore to be accorded overriding importance in current economic programming followed, by what is regarded as a political essential ■— the maintenance of tho consumption standards of the people at large. All other programs requiring the expenditure of funds tend to be ranged in order of their pertinence to immediate defense and security needs. ’	- ✓ •	*
- • The. economy of South Vietnam was severely weakened by the years of recurrent warfare after 1940, particularly during the Indochina hostilities, . and by the subsequent loss through partition of the mines and manufacturing industry, of North Vietnam. Sources of supply .and markets were disrupted and the economic balance of the region destroyed. In the countryside, vital water control works were damaged or neglected, large areas of rice land were abandoned, and the livestock population was seriously depleted as farmers moved to urban areas in search of security. The influx of about 900,000 refugees from North Vietnam in 1954-55 further burdened the economy.
Supported by heavy US assistance after 1955, South Vietnam'was able .by 1959 to make several notable economic achievements. Besides building up a moe'ern military force and absorbing the refugees from ths North (activities which themselves accounted for about 85 percent of the aid furnished by the US), South Vietnam made progress in repairing its heavily damaged transportation network, in restoring the productivity of its agriculturej in providing land to 'its landless peasants (including the

refugees) in carrying out other agricultural reforms, and in establishing some basis for industrial growth. For example, the reconstruction of the principal railroad, running for almost 700 miles along the coast • from Saigon to just north of Hue, was completedj the production of rico, which supports most of the population, reached the estimated prewar annhal average of 3.5 million metric tons of paddy; about 140,000 landless parsons were resettled in sparsely populated areh.s in the highlands and Nbhong delta as another means to counter. Communist infiltration as vol! as to relieve population pressures in the crouded coa still region; and construction or planning had began on several medium-size manufacturing plants, principally in the textile industry.
Despite the serious security and political situations curing ths past.year and a half, agricultural and industrial output has increased and the main reconstruction .projects have been completed. Paddy rice production in 19&0 (the 1959-60 crop) rose to over 5 million metric tons, exceeding the prewar .level for the first time, and the 1960-61. crop, which began to coma oh ths market toward the end of 1960, was slightly higher, Ry the end of 1960, as a result of the government's agrarian reform and land distribution programs, .the number of landless peasants resettled in villages in the highlands and delta areas increased to more than 170,COO,.an additional 123,000 tenant farmers were able to purchase land holdings they formerly . worked or to establish homesteads on abandoned lands, and some 44,000 other •"peasants Were resettled in 22 "agrovilles", the highly controversial govern mat . built villages in the delta area, Significant progress has been met in the reconstruction and expansion of the road system by completion of three princi--pal projects. National Routes J9 and 21 in the. central part of the country anc the Saigon-Bien Hoa highway, and the approaching completion of work on other important’routes. Industrial expansion since the end of 1959 has bean .groatcr . than at tiny time since 1955. There has been a sharp increase in the number of medium-size and s’ all plants constructed, under construction, or planned for South Vietnam’s light industry (which includes textiles, fertilizer, sugar, glass, paper, etc.); coal production has risen appreciably and is soon‘expected to supply all of South Vietnam’s requirements; and construction ( Fas begun on a large hydroelectric plant at the .Da Nhim river (financed

Since the.end of Jast year Saigon merchants have reported increasing difficulty in delivering their titer-chandie a to the villages, and ctmastic commorce-has deolined in part because of the uncertainties of the political situa- . tion. Communist sabotage of roads e nd bridges and Communist control of ■certain areas'have set back the government’s reconstruction and agrarian reform and land distribution programs. Finally, although there has been " an increase in the production of rubber, the leading source of foreign exchange, rubber plantations have come Wider increasing harassment by Communist terrorists.
South. Vietnam’s reliance on US grant aid has not lessened over the past several years. Hiring fiscal years 1955-60 total-economic aid amounted to about $11 billion, including several loans totalling about, million. The continued high degree of dependence derives primarily from the burden imposed on the economy by the defense establishment, MiIi-tary and security costs alone were budgeted at about 5.8 billion piasters (or about $221 million at the official rate of 35 to the dollar) in 1960, an amount which exceeds the total revenue Which the government is currently . extracting from the underdeveloped economy.
Dependence on foreign assistance is also clearly reflected in the external trade of South Vietnam. Deports in the period 1955-60 have covered only about 28/ of imports, averaging f68 million per year compared with average annual imports of $244 million. In 1960, rubber and rice furnished 89;, of the exports by value, with rubber alone accounting for 57/. Consumer goods make up a significant portion of the’imports, reflecting the necessity for increased'development of South Vietnamrs domestic manufacturing capacity. About 74/5 of all imports are financed by the IS commodity import program whereby goods purchased with aid dollars are sold for Vietnamese piasters and ths proceeds used to support the national budget and pay the piaster costs of economic assistance projects. France has remained South Vietnam's principal buyer and supplier, although its importance as a'supplier of imports has declined considerably since l?55t The US is the second leading buyer and supplier while Japan is becoming increasingly important as a supplier.

Diem government has labelled as being clearly directed and assisted by the DRV. Concern over the security of its frontier with Laos has led the government to place its armed forces in the border area under a continuing alert status, to dispatch a small contingent of covert military personnel into southern Laos ostensibly to carry out intelligence and reconnaissance operations, and to enter into secret negotiations with the Lao Government for joint planning to defend southern Laos and the border area. Regarding the current international efforts to resoI.ve the Laos situation, the Diem government has held that the "neutralisation” of Laos wo' ld inevitably result in a Communist takeover and thereby aggravate greatly the already serious Communist threat to South. Vietnam-
The strained relations with Cambodia since 1994 have been highlighted by several serious crises and protracted exchanges of highly inflammatory propaganda. The. persisting problems include border incidents, territorial ar.d financial claims, ar.d covert political conspiracies, The most serious crisis, for example, occurred in the early part of 1?59 and centered around probable involvement by the Diem government in an abortive conspiracy against Chief of State (then prime minister) Prince Sihanouk. During tho first half of 1961, tensions were exacerbated by the capture of two Vietnamese fishing boats in Cambodian waters ar.d by the flight of some. 1,5'00 Cambodian residents in South Vietnam into Cambodia, probably in order to escape internecine fighting between Vietnamese army and ■ security forces and Communist guerrillas.1 However, the basic factor in South Vietnamese-Cambedian relations has been DiemJs and Sihanouk’s intense dislike and distrust of each other, aggravated by their essentially divergent international political orientations. For his part, Diem seems convinced that Sihanouk is unstable and weak, sympathizes with and possibly supports anti-Dicm activities by Vietnamese Communist and non-Coxamists, ar.d cannot bc relied upon to keep Cambcdia out of Communist hands.

VI. OUTLOOK
A.	Internal Security
The Vietnamese Communist apparatus can be expected to maintain a pressing and diversified campaign of guerrilla-terrorist and subversive • warfare in South Vietnam. The principal immediate Communist objectives will continue to be the demoralization of the public, weakening and supplanting of government authority in countryside, and precipitation of a non-Communist coup effort. There are strong indications that Communists will attempt a greater armed effort after the rainy season later this year although they may continue to avoid any large-scale engagement with the increasingly effective Vietnamese army, except in places and at times of their own choosing. Statistics indicate that the total number of casualties among military-security personnel and local officials during 1961 is likely to exceed the total for 1960. In the meantime, the Communists will continue to place considerable importance on political, propaganda, and economic activities, in order to strengthen their controls in the countryside, encourage a popular front opposition, and disrupt further the economy.
In the short run, the Communist apparatus in South Vietnam does not appear to have the capacity to foment a large-scale insurrection or to seize control of the government without considerable assistance from North Vietnam, which would necessarily be of such magnitude that it would bo tantamount to overt military aggression. Barring such a development and given effective implementation of the government's counterinsurgency plans, reinforced by substantial US aid, the government should be able to reduce somewhat the level of Communist insurgency during the next year or so and conceivably even reverse the trend against the Communists. In the longer run, Communist insurgency can be substantially reduced but the government probably cannot, within the foreseeable future, eliminate it entirely, principally because of the government’s inability to seal completely South Vietnam's frontiers with North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
However, security prospects over the next year may well be influenced by developments in neighboring Laos than by the extent to which the Diem government can improve the effectiveness of its military and security forces. If Laos comes under predominantly Communist control, Communist capabilities in South Vietnam would almost certainly be strengthened to a degree unprecedented since the end of the Indochina hostilities. Southern Laos could be expected to become a major, if not the most important, base for directing, supplying, and expanding Communist operations in South Vietnam. In this event, the level of Communist insurgency might assume the proportions of widespread guerrilla warfare and some areas (including portions of the central highlands) would probably come under complete Communist control, within which Hanoi, might attempt to establish a Communist but ostensibly independent government with both military and political support from the bloc. South Vietnam's urban centers probably would be increasingly subjected to Communist guerrilla and terrorist acts insighting much anxiety in the centers of government power and spark a non-Communist c<

effort. The possibility of Communist attempts to assassinate Diem would increase, and Americans would probably be singled out as special targets for terrorist attacks.
In the face of a Communist offensive of such proportions, South Vietnam would be. required to make a maximum military effort in order to . survive. Thera would be no inmed. in to collapse. In the. long run, however, the maintenance of South Vietnam's independence would rest principally on the nature and amount of US support and on a waxiwum effort by the South Vietnamese government to develop the political, psychological, and economic programs required to gain and retain popular support.
B.	Domestic Political	....
: The stability of the government during the next year or so will depend principally on Diem's handling of the internal security situation. If Diem can demonstrate a continuing improvement in security conditions, hc should be able to strengthen his position, alleviate concern and boost morale within his bureaucracy and. military establishment, and lessen the urgency with which many of their membeys view the current situation. However, if the fight against the Communists goes poorly or the South Vietnamese Army suffers heavy casualties, the chances of a coup would substantially increase, Moreover, the possibility of a coup attempt at any time cannot be discounted, The odds favor a coup if security declines appreciably further, particularly if accompanied by what amounts to a Communist takeover of Laos.	;	.	■ . •	-

■ -. Tile Communists would like to initiate and control a coup against Diem, and their armed and subversive operations, including "united front" propaganda among disaffected groups in South Vietnam, arc directed toward this purpose. It is morc likely, however, that any coup .attempt which occurs during the next year or so would bc non-Communist in leadership, involving army elements and civilian officials and perhaps some disgruntled . oppositionists outside the government. In any event, the participating elements probably would be: broader than those involved in the 1960 .attempt, would have greater'popular support particularly among-the. youth and labor groups; and could ba expected to be better prepared to execute their plan quickly and successfully. Moreover,.'while the role of the military Teader-•	ship is by no means certain, a major split among ths generals does not
; , appear likely.' Most of them probably would elect to remain ,un commit tad at the outset.of the coup, as they apparently did in November 1960, adding •‘their tacit or active support to whatever side appeared to have the best chance of winning. Under these, circumstances, a military coup attempt would have better than an even chance of succeeding. ’	'	'
Diem's removal -- whether by a military coup, assassination, or , death from accidental or natural causes -- would considerably strengthen the power of the military. The odds appear about evcn betwaan a government ' x

led by a military junta or by Vice President: Tho, with the army playing a major if not the predominant: role behind the scenes. fOn the one hand, the military might conclude, that a military-lfd government would bc bet ter able, to maintain national unity and, internal political cohesion and, more importantly, to conduct a dctermine.d and effective campaign against the Communists. On the other hand, they might conclude that Tho, who apparently has been on good terms with some of the present military leaders, would not disagree with their viev.’s on tho manner of conducting the fight against the Communists and that his constitutional succession would legalize the change in government and avert a serious power struggle. (Although Diem’s brothers, Nhu and Can, would probably also be removed by a coup, they might attempt to retain real political power in the event	...
Diem left the scene by weans other than a coup. However, the army would	,
probably act quickly to neutralise their efforts.)! Another-important factor which would almost certainly enter into the calculations of the military would be the fortunes of the coup group in South Korea and thc course of US-RCK relations. (In any evcnt, a government led by the military, by Tho, or by any other civilian approved by the military would probably . maintain Vietnam’s pro-US orientation.,	•
. -f If there is a serious disruption of government leadership as a result of a military coup or as a result of Dietl's death, any momentum thc government's counterinsurgency efforts had achieved would probably be halted and possibly reversed, at least for a time,. Moreover, the confusion and suspicion attending thc disruption would provide the Communists an opportunity to strengthen their position in the countryside, and. they might even be emboldened to attempt to seize control, of the government. Since a serious split within the military leadership does not appear likely, Communist attcmpts to take over the government- in Saigon would probably fail.	'	'.	.	•	.	'
Economic
. Because of the greatly increased internal and external Communist threat:., improvement in South Vietnam's economic position during the next few years will depend largely on developments in the security and defense fields. ijoTcover, if larger and more effective military and security . forces are to be maintained, South Vietnam is likely to remain increasingly dependent oh-US .aid during this period. The security situation also will ■ continue'to a file t adversely the will ingness of the government to undertake' < fiscal reforms, urged by the US, aimed at increasing tax revenues.
" Agrarian reform and land distribution programs, as v?cll as highway and canal reconstruction, will continue to suffer as long as the govern-riant;'s control of much of the countrysida, particularly in the Mekong delta area, remains as tenuous as it is at present. Prolonged, unrelieved insecurity in the countryside would result in a decline of agricultural output, a further decline in domestic commerce, and a Tottering of business

confidence in South Vietnam. The cumulative cffact of all these developments could be intTatio-o, particularly if the government were to undertake large-scale deficit financing of its budget. One of the encouraging factors in South Vietnam has.been the fact that the price level has not risen cotva-nsurately with the money suPI'ly, reflecting increased private holdings of piasters. Impairment of Cuis confidence could bring out. of hoarding 3 to 4 billion piasters which would create •serious inflation,	'
... .
. . Unless the security and defense situations deteriorate appreciably further, development of South Vietnam's light; industry, concentrated in tile Saigon-Choton area, probably will continue at about ths present pace. Most of the effort, ho*,raver, may be directed toward the completion of plants currently undcr construction or in the planning stage. The GVN can also be expected to give high priority to the Da Nhim hydroelectric project and to increasing coal production.
The security situation has thus far not prevented an increase in the export of rubber which, along with rice, is the mainstay of South Vietnam's foreign trade. The trade gap, although still substantial, has been progressively narrowed in recent years and can be further decreased in the short run only by maintaining the availability of rubber and rice . for export. Tre short-run outlook is not bright, however, in view of ths adverse effects of Communist insurgency on rice exports and increased .Communist harrassmant of rubber plantations. In the long run South
Vietnam will probably have to rely increasingly on agricultural diversi-fication which, as in the cases of pork and kenaf, leads to new exports ■ and on increased consumer goods production which, as in the cases of coal and textiles, replace imports or substitute thc importation of raw materials for finished goods respectively.. In any event, South Vietnam will continue for thc foreseeable future to require extensive. US aid to finance its large balance of payments deficit.
D. Foreign Affairs	■	■	'	-	;*	'	• - -
Decent increases in US assistance, a jointly agreed plan to combat Communist insurgency, and manifestations to Diem of 'US sympathy and backing, have provided a basis for a continuing close relationship between the US and South Vietnam. To a considerable extent, hovzever, Diem and his advisors appear to rcgard recent US decisions toward South Vietnam as * a vindication of the wisdom ’of their basic approach to political and economic problems, as a recognition of thair long-standing efforts to get special US consideration of their appraisal of the sariousness of the Communist threat, and as a reward for South Vietnam*s steadfast support and anti-Communist orientation. The Victncme.se leaders, therefore, will almost certainly continue to press for increased aid, further expansion of the armed forces, and a clear priority of military over political and . economic efforts to’undercut rhe Communists. Moreover, Diem will be	•

adamant in his views as to how the campaign against Communist insurgency should be wa-.-d, and he will tend to regard US differences with such vieus or criticism of his inncr circle as indications of v/aakening US confidence in him.	•	•	.
Diem probably still has some lingering suspicion of the extent of US confidence .in and support of his leadership, resulting from the abortive coup attempt of Kovambar 1950 and urgent and persistent: representations made during that year for liberal political reforms. In the event: of another coup effort against Diem, he would, probably expect quick and strong US public support and would feel that ho did not have US confidence if such support ware not forthcoming.	'	•
t ■	_	....
Diem will also continue to press the US for a strong anti-Commonist posture in the Far East, particularly as it pertains to US policy toward Laos, Nationalist China, and tho issue of Chinese Communist representation in thc UN. If he concludes that the US is weakening its anti-Communist posture in the Far East, he will almost certainly make strong protests and become increasingly assertive and stubborn in his relations with the US. However, in the absence of any acceptable alternative to US support ■ end assistance to Vietnam, he is likely to avoid jeopardizing seriously basic US-South Vietnamese ties. Indeed, he would probably seek to establish closer ties with th?. US by such means as a mutual defense treaty and possibly the stationing of US forces in South Vietnam if thc Communist threat to the area increased substantially, as would be manifested, for example, in a Communist takeover of Laos or in the achievement of nuclear capability by Communist China.	.
In the event of the failure of the international conference at Geneva to reach an effective and' satisfactory settlement on Laos or a resumption of all-out military operations by the rebel forces in Laos, Diem would be greatly tempted to increase, substantially his covert forces in southern Laos and, in cooperation with Lao government forces, attempt to prevent: complete Communist control of that area. Diem would probably seek US and Thai participation in a concerted armed effort in southern Laos as" well as assurances that the US would defend South Vietnam in case such action precipitated open DRV aggression.
In South Vietnamese-Cambodian relations, tha best that probably can be expected from v’bat now appears to be a temporary and ephemeral situation of mutual restraint by Diem and Sihanouk is the resolution of one or more outstanding problem. Although this could probably lessen the chances of recurring crises and possibly strengthen thc current • political "cease-fire," there is little: prospect that cordial relations • will develop so long as the present leaders of thc two countrics remain in power. Moreover, if Sihanouk were to become too accommodating to Communist pressure, particularly in the event thc Cce.'iunists gaincd a predominant position in Laos, Diem may be unable to rcsist the tcmptatic,.-

BLOC SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNIST EBFORT AGAINST . THE GOVERNMENT GF VIETNAM . ■- • \
THE PROBLEM
Tg estimate the extent and nature of Bloc support of the Communist effort against Suuth Vietnam.1
THE ESTIMATE
;	1. The Communist subversive and guerrilla
apparatus in South Vietnam, known as the Viet Cong, is an integral part of the North Vietnamese Communist Party and it looks to Hanoi for political and military guidance and various forms of support. Hanoi is the implementing agency for Bloc activity in South Vietnam, and the Hanoi authorities are allowed considerable local freedom in conducting Viet Cong guerrilla and subversive activity. The Communist Bloc probably Views the guerrilla and subversive campaigns in Laos and South Vietnam as two parts of a single broad political-military strategy,' and of the two, considers South Vietnam as the • ; • more significant prize.
2.	The Viet Cong arc using Maoist tactics. A • large part of the North Vietnam Army was i trained in Communist China during the Indo-■	. china war ending.in 19.54, and some of these
' ’troops are'leading operations in South Vietnam now. Each Bloc country has supported the "struggle” in the South with propaganda, notably during Pham Van Dong’s trip to other Bloc areas in June-August, J 961
’For a broader treatment of the situation and prospects in South victnum, see NIE 1-13/53- Gl, “Prospects for North and South Vietnam;’' dated !5 August iSCL	_	•
3.	Since early 1930 a general Hanoi-directed political and paramilitary Communist ofTcn-sivc against President Diem and his government of Vietnam (GVN) has been underway, ■ and during the past year Illis campaign has taken on increased tempo and scale. The Viet Cong apparatus has undergone rapid expansion, and the scope and area of operations of its guerrilla units have increased significantly. More recently, the Viet Cons, has begun to operate in larger sized units (500-1,000 men) and they have extended large-scale attacks to include, for the first time, the. plateau area in' the northern part of South Vietnam.
4.	Apparently in response to this direction from Hanoi, cadre personnel and many special items, such as' communications equipment, chemicals, medical supplies, and other items needed for guerrilla warfare not available in the countryside, are being infiltrated into South Vietnam via long established land and sea routes. Thousands of Junks which ply the coastal routes of the Indochina peninsula provide a means of infiltration extremely difficult to control. Mountain trails in southern Laos have boon used freely by the Communists for years for movement of men and supph'cs between North and South Vietnam. Other infiltration routes pass through Cambodia.
. Nevertheless, the Vici Cong effort is still

S E C h* E T
Iargcly a self-supporting operation in respect to recruitment and supplies. The Viet Cong h'vci upon locally ‘produced food which .they cither grow themselves or levy upon villages. They meet most of their currency needs by taxing areas'under'their control, by robbery, or by blackmail. Most of their arms and much of their ammunition have been locally acquired or captured from GVN Army and security forces.	'	•
, 5. We estimate present armed, full-time Viet i Cong strength at. about 10,000, an increase, . despite substantial combat losses, of 12,000 ■ since April of 19G0 and of 4,000 in the past ' three months. About 10 20 percent of total
Viet Cong strength consists of cadres inOl-’ (rated from North Vietnam mostly via mbun-I tain trails through southern Laos. Most of I the remaining 80-90 percent of the Viet Cong arc local recruits, but they also include remnants of the approximately 10,000 stay-behind personnel who went underground during the ’ 1954-1955 regroupment and evacuation of
Victnmnc.se Communist Army units following the 1 ldochina War. Approximately 90,000 Vietnamese Communist troops were cvacuatcd to North Vietnam during this period, most of whom v/erc from south and central Vietnam. It is from this pool of experienced fighters that most of the guerrilla cadres now operating hr South Vietnam are drawn. These hard-core guerrillas are augmented by sev-cral thousand supporters who, under the cover of normal civilian pursuits, join tlic organized insurgent bands to assist in intcBigencc, sabotage, propaganda, and terrorist operalions. In addition, local inhabitants in many areas providc tlic Viet Cong v/ith recruits, food, refuge, and operational support, in some cases voluntarily and in o.thcrs as the result ’ of intimidation dr coercion.	•
6.	As part of the buildup for their current campaign, tlic Viet Cong have established an extensive communications network. Much of the communications cquipmcnt in use is probably quite primitive and some of it is assembled in the field. Thore is evidence, however, that in addition there arc substantial quantities of sophisticated communica-
2
lions equipment and well-trained technicians serving the Viet Cong. Such cquipmcnt and the necessary maintenance and operating personnel were infiltrated into South Vietnam.
7.	Tilde has been no positive identification of Bloc manufactured military equipment, in South Vietnam. Most of the arms and cqujp-ment now in use by. the Viet Cong is of US or Flench origin. Although weapons have been infiltrated from North Vietnam, most Vict Cong equipment is probably from caches established at the end of the Indochina War or is equipment captured from GVN armed forces or security forces. During 196^ ovcr 3,000 small arms were lost, by GVN armed forces during combat. Some items, such as grenades, land mines, booby traps, and small arms ammunition arc locally manufactured by village level Viet Cong “arsenals,” from materials procured locally m imported from • North Vietnam and Cambodia. Moreover, in view of the physical problems of infiltrating large amounts of arms and ammunition into South Vietnam, many Viet Cong operations are primarily for the purpose .of capturing arms, ammunition, medical supplies, and other cquipmcnt. A major buildup of Floc equipment in South Vietnam is likely to await the improvement ol Jines of communication
. into and within.South Vietnam.
8.	Outlook. Viet Cong control of the Ca Mau peninsula at the southern tip of South Vietnam has been virtually complete for several years. During the dry season beginning ju November, the Vict Cong will probably intensify the exploitation of GVN weaknesses in the plateau areas of the north and central parts of the country, seeking to establish another ."liberated area” as a logistics base from which larger scale operations could be mounted. The creation of a second ‘‘liberated area” in the plateau region adjacent to southern Laos would enable the Viet Cong to. keep GVN forces split and prevent the concentration of effort against cither. Moreover, a strong Vict Cong position in (he plateau area would scri-ousIy threaten tbe'rear of Diem’s troops posted along the demilitarized zone.

9.	To a considerable extent the ability of the Viet Cong to maintain this expanded chort yvill depend upon improved logistical support from the outside. It is probable that the Bloc intends to build up the eastern part of south Laos, improving the roads, mountain trails, and airfields, as a major supply channel to
support a stepped up Viol Cong campaign in north and central Vietnam. Th orc has already been a considerable increase in Communist troop strength in south Inos, a sub-slant ial supply buildup; particularly cast of Thakhck, and an increase in the Communist airlift into the area.

a.	Naval forccs in support of SEATO Plan 5 operations would consist of one or two attack carrier strike groups with supporting forces. The employment of these units would not unacceptably reduce Seventh. Fleet capabilities in other areas of til'- Western Pacific. In the event that overt Chinese Communist intervention

These actions arc in consonance with currently approved military plans.
b.	The "massive deterrent US air power" referred to in the paper was designod io provide the North. Vietnamese with evidence of the US intent, determination and capability. This "show of force" exercise could be conducted by Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft deployed to Southeast Asia under SEATO Planj 5, USAF aircraft based at Clark AB, Philippines, other P/lCONi aircraft using air-to-air refueling, or by SAC training flights.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Concept of Use of SEA.TO Forces in . South Vietnam (C)
1.	Reference is mate to the memorandum by the Deputy Secretary of DfRmse, dated 5 October 1961, subject as above. The Joint Chiefs of Sial, have considered the proposed concept for the use of SE/tTO forces in South Vietnam an,, the suggested two principal military possibilities for its implementation.
2.	It is their opinion that the use of SEATO forces at the orcatest	t
possible number of entry points along th- whole South Vietnam border, but excluding that part of the 17th parallel now held by the South	?
Vietnamese Armv itself, is not feasible for the following reasons:	. f
a.	SEATO forces will be deployed over a border of several hun.’red miles ano. will be attacked piecemeal or by-passed at the Vict Cong’s own choice.

b.	It may reduce out cannot stop infiltration of Viet Cong personnel and material.
. .c. lt deploys SEATO force s in the weakest defense points • should DRV or CUCOIvi forces intervene.
c . It compounds the problems of communications and logistical support.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
3.	Further, the alternative possibility of using SNATO forces to cover solely the 17th parallel, although considercd feasible to a limited extent, is militarily unsound in view of the following considerations;
a. The 1 7th parallel is not a main avenue of approach being usee by the Viet Cong.	.
, b. North Vietnam may interpret such SEATO action as preparation for aggression against them, thus promoting the possibility of communist harassment and destruction of friendly combat and logistic forces concentrated near the parallel, if not escalation.
4.,As stated in your memorandum, the proposed concepat set forth must be analyzed in the total context of the defense of Southeast Asia. Any concept which deals with the defense of Southeast Asia that does not include all or a substantial portion of Laos is, from a military standpoint, ; unsound. To concede the majority of northern and centra] Laos would leave three quarters of the border of Thailand exposed and thus invite an expansion of communist military action. To concede southern Laos would open the flanks of both. Thailand and Scuth Vietnam as well as
,. expose. Cambodia. Any attempt to combat insurgency in South Vietnam, while holding areas in Laos essential to the defense of Thailand and • South Vietnam and, at the same time, putting troops in Thailand, would require an effort on the part of the Unitec States alone on the order of
' magnitude of at least three divisions plus supporting units. This would require an additional two divisions from the United States.
c •	< f	.	.	.	.	.	•
5. Y-hat is needed is not the spreading out of our forces throughout Southeast Asia but rather a concentrated effort in Laos where a firm stand can be taken saving all or substantially all of J_aos which would, . *	• «.( the same time, -protect Thailand and protect the borders of South .
Vietnam.

2.	To defend Thailand and South Vietnam, holding Laos or areas thereof to the extent required as being essential to the defense of Thailand and South Vietnam.
HILITARV OBJECTIVES
1.	To assist by the use of SEATO forces in securing the borderS of South Vietnam to the maximum extent possible against the infiltration of personnel and material in support of the Viet Cong.
2.	To aseist the Government of South Vietnam to regain full control of its own territory and to eliminate the Viet Cong threat by freeing South Vietnam forces for offensive action against the Viet Cong.

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
1.	SEATO ground and air forces will deploy to South Vietnam to assist in protecting the South Vietnam-Laos border, cxclusiVe of that part of the lyth parallel now held in force by I Corps of the South Vietnamese Army (I Corps Tactical 'T Area), southward to the Cambodian border.
2.	SEATO ground forces of approximately one division Strength (11,000) initially will deploy to the high plateau region of the Pleiku area. Securing this region with SEATO forces will free South Vietnamese forces to conduct effective offensive operations elsewhere. Further deployments to assist in interrupting the flow of personnel and material in support of the Viet Cong into South Vietnam will be at the discretion of the- SEATO Field Force Commander in light of the existing tactical situation. The SEATO force will further assist South Vietnamese -forces by the provision of air, communications and
<( logistic support.
3.	The additional command and control communications •-electronics requirements for the support of this concept are set forth in Appendix B to Enclosure B.

requested, in operations against Viet Cong sea infiltration.
4; The source of US forces to support this concept would
be from those forces now assigned to the Pacific Command. Our military posture is such that the employment of the SEATO forces would not adversely affect our capability to conduct planned operations in Europe relating to Berlin.

RULES GF ENGAGEMENT
1.	SEATO forces may take whatever action is, in the opinion of the Commander, necessary to insure the security of the force itself. .	.
2.	Offensive actions by SEATO forces against the Viet Cong will be limited normally to those necessary to destroy such Viet Cong forces as pose a threat to either:
a.	The borders of South Vietnam, or
b.	The security of the SEATO force itself. Such offensive action enVisages the possibility of reasonably limited projection of SEATO air and/or ground forces beyond the borders of South Vietnam into Laos.
3.	Aerial reconnaissance by the SEATO Air Component will normally be confined to Laos and South Vietnam.
4.	SEATO forces will be permitted to retaliate immediately against North Vietnam overt military interVention by launching air strikes against military targets in that country.

I	.	*	‘	*
did decide to act overtly to counter the introduction of SEATO
forccs into the area, this action would probably follow, in ' general, the pattern set forth below:
G-tOUNE ACTIONS	-
a. jbaSically an infantry invasion of South Vietnam and
Lqos and deployed in strength and direction as follows:
(1)	Five diVisions on the North/South Vietnam border
to Saigon along the coastal route Via Dong Ha - Tourane -Binh Dinh.
(2)	One diVision (light) to Vientiane via Xieng -Khouang - Paksane.
(3)	One division (light) to Thakhek and SaVannekhet Via Mugia Pass apd Keo Neua Pass.	.
(4)	A follow-up force of up to six divisions moVing as follows:
(a) Two divisions to Saigon or Bangkok via Lao
( <	. .	. Bao Pass - down the lower Mekong Valley along Route
13 to Saigon or across the Mekong River to Bangkok.

13 through Laos into Thailand and on to Bangkok.

North/South Vietnam border to be available to put additional momentum along the coastal route, or to effect a subsidiary effort in the Kontum-Pleiku Plateau. <•••	6 Li 5 ,

- ■ b. A secondary effort, or threat thereof, by about nine Chinese Communists divisions into Burma and Northern
:	( Thailand, which could be supported as follows:
(.1) Three' divisions, one lightly equipped, to ‘	I	,	.
northern Thailand via northwest Burma.
'	(2) Six divisions toward Rangoon along the Burma Road
and via -Myitkylna to .Henda lay, then south in the internal transport system of Burma.
c. There would probably be a build-up in North Vietnam and possibly a build-up along the China-Burma border before any' _	.
( invasion was Initiated. The invasion would probably be on the 1
; broadest possible front employing lightly equipped troops to infiltrate between defending forces and thereby minimizing I
■
• the effects of nuclear weapons against deployed ground troops. I
. These infiltrating forces would be supported by columns advancing quickly down main routes. Battalion-size or smaller airborne units might be used, chiefly to seize and hold key features .
i such as bridges, airfields, critical road junctions. The communists would exploit to the fullest their ability to
. c 1 "iltrate. through the most difficult countx’y and would not necessarily be tied to the highways and roads. Large numbers , of porters and pack animals would be available and jungle trails would be used to a great extent, though this would restrict the -speed of attack and the weight of equipment that could be used.

I ~ '	------------:-----------:-------------
AIR ACTIONS
a. The Chinese Communists maintain, on a routine basis, approximately 250 jet fighters in South China. These and other aircraft, including jet light bombers, could be rapidly deployed to. bases ‘in North Vietnam and South China to conduct air opera-■ ■ ■ tions in support of the Communist objective. In the event of a ground invasion of the magnitude suggested above, it is well Within the CHICOM's capability to neutralize the air bases and port facilities in Thailand and South Vietnam in an attempt to deny their use by SEATO forces. Such an operation could precede or accompany the Invasion of ground forces.
REACTION TO CONTINGENCIES
1.	If North Vietnamese forces overtly intervened, the SEATO force would haVe to be increased from the equivalent of
?approximately one diVision at the initiation of the SEATO Plan ' to twelve diVisions, seven Regimental Combat Teams and five battalions. In addition, the SEATO force would haVe air and naval superiority. Such a force is considered^adeQuate to defeat the North Vietnamese-forces.
2.	US force contribution to the enlarged SEATO force required e » c . .
to combat such DRV action would include two Army divisions, one
Marine division/wing team and five USAF tactical squadrons de-r	■	.	•	•
ployed in Thailand and South Vietnam. The US forces would be increased from 14,000 to a total of approximately 129,000, not including Navy forces. One diVision for this force must come from the continental United States. This could require the call, up of one diVision plus other appropriate forces to maintain the US strategic reserve.
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
3.	The mission of the enlarged SEATO force would be to defend Laos and South Vietnam against attack by forces of the Democratic • . Republic .of Vietnam (DRV) and to inflict a quick and decisive defeat on the military forces of the DRV. The general concept • • • * •
is to hold the enemy as far forward as possible, destroy his
forces, his lines of communication, and those installations directly supporting his war making capability. When appropriate, SEATO forces would mount a general offensive against the enemy. They would have a capability of conducting amphibious assault operations in North Vietnam in case the military situation so dictated
4.	If the Chinese Communists interVene, whether by regular or "volunteer" forces, political authorization for essential military actions must bo anticipated since prompt counteractions’ would be required. There would be issues whether to attack
selected targets in South China with conventional weapons and
whether to initiate use of nuclear weapons against targets in direct support of Chinese operations in Laos.	•
5.	In this event the SEATO force would be increased to
fifteen diVisions and eight RCTs (278,000) deployed in the '
defense of Southeast Asia.

6.	The US contribution to this force would be three ground diVisions deployed in Thailand and South Vietnam and one Marine ■ Division/Wing Team, prepared for amphibious assault operations against North Vietnam as the military situation dictated. Two ■ , ■
I’ diViSions ’and additional air forces would haVe to come from the continental United States. This could require the call up of two additional divisions plus other appropriate forces to maintain the US strategic reserve.
7.	The mission of the SEATO force would be expanded to defend Southeast Asia against attack by Chinese Communist forces and
‘ •	those of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The general con-
cept of operation would be to launch air and naval attacks, to delay the enemy's advance with local forces and interdict his lines of communications with air and naVal forces, while conducting an unremitting air and naval offensiVe to destroy the enemy ' s war-making capac ;• ty.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY
SUBJECT: Viet-Nam
Even if the decision at tomorrow's meeting it only prelininary— to explore with Diem and the British, Australians, and New Zealanders would be my guess — it is clearly of the greatest possible importance. Above all, action must proceed fast.
For what one man’s feel is worth, mine -- based on very close touch with Indochina in the 1954 war and civil war afterwards till Diem took hold -- is that is i s really now or never if we are to arrest the gains being made by the Viet Cong. Walt Rostow made the point yesterday that the Viet Cong are about to move, by every indication, from the small unit basis to a moderate battalion-size basis. Intelligence also suggests that they may try to set up a "provisional government" like Xieng Khuang (though less legitimate appearing) in the very Kontum area into which the present initial plan would move SEATO forces. If the Viet Cong movement "blooms" in this way, it will almost certainly attract all the back-the-winner sentiment that understandably prevails in such cases and that beat the French in early 1954 and came within an ace of beating Diem in early 1955.
An early and hard-hitting operation has a good chance (70^ would be my guess) of arrestin?: things and giving Diem a chance to do better and clean up. Even if we follow up hard, on the lines the JCS are working out after yesterday's meeting, however, the chances are not much better that we will in fact be able to clean up the situation. It all depends on Diem's effectiveness, which is very problematical. The 30^ chance is that we would wind up like the French in 1954; white men can't win this kind of fight.
On a 70-30 basis, I would myself favor going in. But if we let, say, a month go by before we move, the odds will slide (both short-term shock effect and long-term chance) down to 60-40, 50-50, and so on. Leos under a Souvanna Phouma deal is more likely than not to go sour, and will more and more make things difficult in South Viet-Nam, which again underscores the element of time.

THE ASSUMPTION
. For the purpose of this estimate it is assumed that in response to an appeal from the Government of Vietnam (GVN), SEATO ground, naval, and air forces numbering about 25,000 are committed to patrol the GVN coast and to secure the GVN-Laotian border against incursions' or infiltration from tke Communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in North Vietnam. The SEATO objective, .which vzill be publicly an-.V nounced, is to stop external Communist assistance to the Viet Cong Communist guerrillas, while avoiding direct engagement by these troops in the conflict within South Vietnam.
.	THE- ESTIMATE '
1.	We believe that the Communist Bloc would not commit North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces to a large-scale military attack against South Vietnam dr Laos in response to the assumed SEATO action. The DRV would probably seek to
• * * * * . ■ , , ’■ avoid having its regular units enter into a direct military engagement with SEATO, and in particular US, forces. Hanoi,

Peiping, and Moscow-7 would almost certainly be concerned over I the increased risks for each of them of broadened hostilities
involving US forces. Moreover, thcy are generally confident • . • \ that their current low risk tactics of local subversion and supporting "national liberation" struggles will^ continue to b'e successful in Southeast Asia.
2.	Nevertheless, Peiping and Hanoi in particular would be highly concerned as to the intentions of the SEATO forces, '	i	I
particularly during the initial deployment. The presence of I	•
SEATO forces so near its border would be a source of constant
unease to the DRV. Moreover, both Hanoi and Peiping would consider it a particularly urgent matter t*o prevent any in. • ' ■

South Vietnam (the Pathet Lao and the Viet Cong) are ( under the control of the Communist Party of North Vietnam and look to Hanoi for guidance and support. We believe that Hanoi exercises considerable local tactical latitude in conducting the Communist struggle in both . countries. When the struggle is elevated to the international level, as is now the case with Laos, the major Bloc partners play an increasingly important leadership role.

a successful SEATO operation. Both would seek by political means and by military means short of major overt attack, to' • frustrate the SEATO effort.
3. In the situation assumed, we believe that the DRV would seek at first to test the seriousness and effectiveness
. •	I
of the SEATO effort by subjecting the SEATO forces and their land lines of communication to harassment, ambush, and guerrilla attack. The Communists could not be expected to recognize the announced intention of the SEATO forjces to avoid ।involvement in the internal struggle in South Vietnam. They
would probably estimate that by using their Viet Cong appara-i tus in South Vietnam, by committing additional experienced I	3/	।

• could harass the SEATO land forces and infiltrate the SEATO blockade. The Communists would expect .worthwhile political and psychological rewards if their harassment and guerrilla operations against SEATO forces were successful-, including lowered GVN morale and increased tensions among some of the SEATO members. Whil'e seeking to test the SEATO forces, the DRV would not relax its Viet Cong campaign against the GVN.
4.	It is expected that the SEATO action vzould cause the
DRV to try to gain "compensation" in some’.manner, such as possibly declaring the 1954 Geneva Agreements, or pertain articles of the Agreements, abrogated. It might also begin to receive increasing military assistance from the Soviet
Union and Communist China openly and in unconcealed violation of the Agreements, and to buildup an air force which would include jets. The Bloc would attempt to encourage and. instigate Laos and Cambodia to protest to the1 UN if any SEATO forces crossed the South Vietnam border.
5.	If no agreement on Laos had been reached at Geneva prior to the assumed SEATO action, we believe that the Communists would ’take steps to hasten their takeover of Lads.

from South Vietnam, possibly including the stationing of Chinese Communist air units in North Vietnam. Nevertheless, we do not believe Peiping vzould consider assignment of SEATO forces to South Vietnam as an immediate and direct threat to •	I

9.	The reaction to the assumed SEATO action among cont	।

Asian members of SEATO would find renewed confidence in the

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: South Vietnam
At this morning’s meeting with the President the following course of action was agreed upon with relation to South Vietnam:
1.	The Defense Department is authorized to send the Air Force's Jungle Jim Squadron into Vietnam to serve under the MAAG as a training mission and not for combat at the present time.
2.	General Maxwell Taylor accompanied by Dr. Rostov from the white House, General Lansdale, a representative of JCS, Mr. Cottrell from State and probably someone from ISA will leave for Vietnam over the weekend on a Presidential mission (to be announced by the President at this afternoon's press conference as an economic survey) to look into the feasibility from both political and military standpoints of the followi ng:
(a)	the plan for military intervention discussed at this morning's meeting on the basis of the Vietnam task force paper entitled "Concept for Intervention in Vietnam".
(b)	an alternative plan for stationing in Vietnam fewer U.S. combat forces than those called for under the plan referred to in (a) above and with a more limited objective than dealing with the Viet Cong; in other words, such a small force would probably go in at Tourane and possibly another southern port principally for the purpose of establishing a U.S. "presence" in Vietnam;

(c)	other alternatives in lieu of putting any U.S. combat forces in Vietnam, i.e. stepping up U.S. assistance and training of Vietnam units, furnishing of more U.S. equipment, particularly helicopters and other light aircraft, trucks and other ground transport, etc.
3.	During the two or three weeks that will be required for the completion of General Taylor's mission, State will push ahead with the following political actions:
(a)	protest to the ICC on the step-up in North Vietnamese support of Viet Cong activities,
(b)	tabling at the UN a white paper based on Mr. william Jordan's report concerning Communist violations of the Geneva Accords, and
(c)	consultation with our SEATO allies, principally the British and Australians, regarding SEATO actions ,in support of the deteriorating situation in Vietnam.	.

MEMORANDUM FOR GENERAL TAYLOR
SUBJECT: Counterinsurgency Operations in South Vietnam
1.	You will recall that I recently had occasion to look into allegations that the United States is overtraining the Vietnamese Army for a Korea-type war with little or nothing being done to meet the terrorist problem in Vietnam. My inquiries have highlighted the following main points:
a.	The success of the counter-terrorist police organization in Malaya has had considerable impact.
b.	The concept of using local police force to combat local insurgency is politically and diplomatically attractive.
2.	I fully agree that we should make maximum use of these aspects of the British counterinsurgency experience in Malaya which are pertinent to the situation in Vietnam. You will recognize, however, that there are major differences between the situations in Malaya and South Vietnam:
a.	Malayan borders were far more controllable in that Thailand cooperated in refusing the Communists an operational safe haven.
b.	The racial characteristics of the Chinese insurgents in Malaya made identification and segregation a relatively simple matter as compared to the situation in Vietnam where the Viet Cong cannot be distinguished from the loyal citizen.
c.	The scarcity of food in Malaya versus the relative plenty in South Vietnam made the denial of food to the Communist guerrillas a far more important' and readily usable weapon in Malaya.

Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
d.	Most importantly, in Malaya the British were in actual command, with all of the obvious advantages this entails, and used highly trained Commonwealth troops.
c.	Finally, it took the British nearly 12 years to defeat, an insurgency which was less strong than the one in South Vietnam.
3.	Furthermore, as you well know, the success of the counterinsurgency operations in Malaya is not unique. Major terrorist activities have been defeated in both the Philippines and Burma, and in neither place was the police organization used as the framework for coordination and control. In the Philippines, for example, the military framework used was highly successful.
4.	Closely associated with the allegation that the MAAG is "overtraining" the Vietnamese Army is the concern frequently expressed over the length pf time required to train military officers and NCO's. No one knows better than you do that well-trained officers and NCO's are not produced in brief training programs. I am sure you will want to discuss this in detail with General McCarr when you visit Saigon. It is most important to note that the heaviest casualties in the Vietnam insurgency have been suffered by the Civil Guard previously trained as police. Almost without exception, the Viet Cong have attacked the untrained Civil Guard rather than the better trained Array units. This has resulted in a heavy loss of weapons and equipment to the Viet Cong. Untrained Civil Guard units have, in fact, been an important source of weapons and supplies for the Viet Cong, and their known vulnerability has been an invitation for the Viet Cong to attack. General McCarr believes that reversion of the Civil Guard to police control would set back the counterinsurgency operation in South Vietnam by at least a year.
5.	with respect to training the Vietnamese Army for the "wrong war*, it seems clear that in recent months the insurgency in South Vietnam has developed far beyond the capacity of police control. All of the Vietnamese Army successes this past summer have met Viet Cong opposition in organized battalion strength. Even larger Communist units were involved in the recent Viet Cong successes north of Kontum. This change in the situation has not been fully understood by many U.S. officials.
325

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
6.	In this regard, there is some concern that the Thompson Mission may try to sell the Malayan concept of police control without making a sufficiently careful evaluation of conditions in South Vietnam. Additionaly, there are some indications that the British, for political reasons, wish to increase their influence in this area and are using the Thompson mission as a vehicle. Consequently, your forthcoming trip to South Vietnam is most timely. Despite repeated urging, the Government of South Vietnam has not yet written an over-all national plan for counterinsurgency. The question of police or military organization for combatting Viet Cong insurgency should be laid to rest in that plan. Your evaluation of this matter could have an important effect on the Governments of both South Vietnam and the United States.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR, HADYN WILLIAMS
SUBJECT: The Geneva Accords of 1954 and the Introduction of • U.S. Combat and Logistic Forces into Viet Nam
You have requested that I submit an opinion on the legal question of the compatibility with the GeneVa Accords of the actions proposed in Saigon’s telegram 537 to the Department of State. The pressure of time forces this opinion to be a preliminary one. A full statement of my reasoning will follow as soon aS it can be prepared. -
My conclusion is that the- actions proposed in the aboVe mentioned telegram would constitute violations of Articles .16 and 17 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Viet Nam of July 20, l9$4. That conclusion is not affected by the reasons, ostensible or real, for the actions.
Article 16 prohibits "the introduction into Viet Nam of any troop reinforcements and additional military personnel". The article does permit, however, under strict conditions, "the rotation of units and groups of personnel". .Since there were 1)0,000 foreign troops in Viet Nam at the time of the ' 1954 Agreement, it can be argued that the United States could introduce up to 1)0)000 combat troops without causing a violation of that Agreement. That argument would of necessity be based upon the supposed rationale of a decision of the International Commission for Supervision and Control
•	‘ in'View Nam, dated April 19,1960, in which an increase in the HAAG was approyed. The CommisSlon gave no reasons for its ruling, and it is far from clear that it would extend its scope to cover combat troops. It is difficult to contend that . • where-troops are' introduced to replace other troots, which departed fiVe to seven years previously there is a ""rotation"
•	of units. Reliance upon the ’’rotation" defense in the present circumstances would run grave risks

EVen if there wore a 170,000 troop "credit" which we could legally draw upon, I doubt that the actions proposed in Snigon’s telegram 537 are compatible with the further limitations contained. in Article 16. For example, no unit introduced could be larger than a battalion, and rotation Would have to be (1)	.
on a mn-for-man basis, (2) notified to the ICC two days in* advance, (3) carried on through certain listed entry points, and (4) Supervised and inspected by the XCC.
t
The provisions of Article 17 might prove eVen more burdensome. Entry of military equipment must take place at listed entry points under the superVision of thc ICC and may only consist of replacement of "war material, arme and munitions which haVe been destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cessation of hostilities . . . on the basis of piece-for-picce. of the same type and with similar characteristics.”
It should be noted that the United States was not a party to the Geneva Accords, but it did declare at the Conference in 1954 that . it will refrain from the-threat or the use of force to disturb. . ." the Accords. Viet Nam, although it was not a signatory of the cease-fire Agreement in question, is, on the other hand, bound by its terms. The Agreement was signed • by the Commander in Chief of the French Union Forces (Viet Nam being part of thc French Union), and this signature was within • the authority of the Commander in Chief. Thus, on the strictly legal plane we need be concerned only about a possible violation by the Government of Viet Nam of its obligations.
As a final comment ’I would point out that the purpose of the introduction has no legal relevance; introduction of U.S. troops for purposes of flood control, would still constitute a violation of the Geneva Accords by the GoVernment of Viet Nam, I suggest that, if a decision is made to send U.S. troops into Vict Mam, vie should Justify their introduction on the ground of collective self-defense. Nothing in the Geneva Accords 'Would be read as abridging the interent right of Viet Nam
i nil the United States to take actions in collective self-defense, if you wish, I shall prepare a memorandum on this point.

The interim Communist goal -- en route to total take-over -appears to be a neutral Southeast Asia, detached from U.S. pro-tecticn. This strategy is well on the way to success in Vietnam.
b.	In Vietnam (and Southeast Asia) there is a double crisis in confidence: doubt that U.S. is determined to save Southeast Asia; doubt that Diem's methods can frustrate and defeat Communist purposes and methods. The Vietnamese (and Southeast Asians) will undoubtedly draw rightly or wrongly -- definitive conclusions in coming weeks and months concerning the probable outcome and will adjust their behaviour accordingly, what the U.S. does or fails to do will be decisive to the end result.
c.	Aside from the morale factor, the Vietnamese Government is caught in interlocking circles of bad tactics and bad administrative arrangements which pin their forces on the defensive in ways which permit a relatively small Viet-Cong force (about one tenth the size of the GVN regulars) to create conditions of frustration and terror certain to lead to a political crisis, if a positive turning point is not soon achieved. The following recommendations are designed to achieve that favorable turn, to avoid further deterioration in the situation in South Vietnam, and eventually to contain and eliminate the threat to its independence.

THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE washington, D.C. 20301
8 November 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT \
SUBJECT: South Vietnam
The basic issue framed by the Taylor Report is whether the U.S.
shall:
a.	Commit itself to the clear objective of preventing the fall of South Vietnam to Communism, and
b.	Support this commitment by necessary immediate military actions a.id preparations for possible later actions.
The Joint Chiefs, Mr. Gilpatric, and I have reached the following conclusions:
1.	The fall of South Vietnam to Communism would lead to the fairly raped extension of Communist control, or complete accommodation to Communism, in the rest of mainland Southeast Asia and in Indonesia. The strategic implications worldwide, particularly in the Orient, would be extremely serious.
2.	The chances are against, probably sharply against, preventing that fall by any measures short of the introduction of U.S. forces on a substantial scale. We accept General Taylor's judgment that the various measures proposed by him short of this are useful but will not in themselves do the job of restoring confidence and setting Diem on the way to winning his fight.
3.	The introduction of a U.S. force of the magnitude of an initial 8,000 men in a flood relief context will be of great help to Diem. However, it will not convince the other side (whether the shots are called from Moscow, Peiking, or Hanoi) that we mean business. Moreover, it probably will not tip the scales decisively. We would be almost certain to get increasingly mired down in an inconclusive struggle.
4.	The other side can be convinced we mean business only if we accompany the initial force introduction by a clear commitment to the fuJl objective stated above, accompanied by a warning through some channel to Hanoi that continued support of the Viet Cong will lead to punitive retaliation against North Vietnam.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
5	• LU-we-act- -iru_ihio__way ,... .tV— .ultimate - possible - extent -of our military cojmni tir.cn t must be facr-u. Thc struggle may be prolonged and
• h'ano_i_.and..reipiI.1E mhy ..tntcrvciic civcrtiy. itl view of the logistic difficulties faced by'the other side, I believe vc can assume that thc • maximum U.S. forccs*required on thc around in Southeaat Asia ’..’ill not * exceed’ 6 divisions , or about. 205 ,000 men, (UhiiCiAC iMnn'EP-ZW -Phase..IV.). Our military posture is, or, with the addition of more Rational Guard or regular Army divisions, cun bo nude, adequate to furnioh these forces .	without serious interference with our present Berlin plans.
6. To accept thc stated objective is of course a most serious decision. Military force is not thc only clement of what must be a most carefully coordinated sct of actions. . Success will dcpend on factors many of which arc not within our control -- notably thc conduct, of Diem himself nnd othcr leaders in thc area. Laos will remain a major problem. The domestic political implications of accepting thc objective are also grave, although it is our feeling that thc country will respond better to a firm initial position than to courses of action that lead us in only gradually, and that in thc meantime are sure to involve casualties. The over-all cffect on Moscow and Peiping will need carcful weighing and
-	may well be mixed; however, permitting .South Vietnam to fall can only
^strengthen and encourage them greatly.
.	7. In sum:	•
.	a. We do not bclieve major units of U.S. forces should be
introduced in South Vietnam unless we are willing to make an affirmative dccision on the issue stated at the start of this
Memorandum.
b.	we arc inclined to recommend that- we do commit thc U.S.
to thc clear objcctive of preventing thc fall of South Vietnam
to Communism and that we support this commitment by the necessary military actions.	.	.
I
c.	If such a commitment is agreed upon, we pupport the
•	• . recommendation's of General Taylor as tnc first steps toward its
fulfillment.

From Saigon
BRITISH ADVISORY MISSION 196, Cong Ly,
Saigon
November 11, 1961
Your Excellency,
As promised at my interview with Your Excellency last wednesday, I now enclose a memorandum briefly outlining plan and the measures required for the clearance of the communists from the Delta area.
As I explained to Your Excellency it will be much easier to make a start on these lines in one area and for this purpose the whole Delta area, south and west of Saigon, comprising the present 32nd and 33rd tactical zones, would appear to be the most promising starting point as compared with the area north of Saigon and the Highlands which require, at the present time, more specifically military measures. Arrangements have now just been made for my mission to visit the Highlands area and Central Vietnam and we are leaving on Monday morning (November 13) and returning on Friday evening (November 17). This will enable us to get a clearer picture of the problems throughout the country as a whole.
I also attach a short note by Mr. Palmer on intelligence, which is related to the organization mentioned in paragraphs 27 and 28 of the memorandum. Mr. Palmer has attempted to provide Your Excellency with a number of examples showing how life can be breathed into the organization. He would, of course, be ready to discuss this further at any time convenient to Your Excellency.
Your Excellency will also understnad from the outline plan in the attached memorandum that it should lend by stages to a reorganization of the Government machine for directing and co-ordinating all action against the communists and to the production of an overall strategic operational plan for the country as a whole defining responsibilities, tasks and priorities. At the same time it will lead to the establishment of a static security framework which can

be developed eventually into a National Police force into which can be incorporated a single security intelligence organization for the direction and co-ordination of all intelligence activities against the communists. I agree with Your Excellency that it would be too disruptive at the present time to try to achieve these * immediately and that they should be developed gradually. Using a medical analogy, the remedy should be clinical rather than surgical.
I look forward to seeing Your Excellency again on my return.

' MEMORANDUM
The aim of this memorandum is to outline a plan and the measures required for the clearance of the communists from the Delta area.
Overall aim
2.	The overall aim of any counter insurgency plan must be to win the people. The killing of communist terrorists will follow automatically from that. If the main emphasis is placed merely on killing terrorists there is a grave risk that more communists will be created than are killed, winning the people must, therefore, be kept in the forefront of the minds of every single pwrson, whether military or civilian, who is engaged in anti-terrorist operations.
Combined Headquarters	-
3.	There is a Very similar terrain throughout the whole area of rice fields and swamp, with mangrove on the coast. The area is at present divided into 12 provinces with two tactical zones (the seven southern provinces and five northern provinces) in each of which a military division is stationed. At the present time there is inadequate direction and co-ordination of the campaign with the result that the 12 provinces are tending to fight separate battles and the communists are able to take advantage of the boundaries between the respective spheres of responsibility.
4.	we should therefore establish a Combined Headquarters for the area to direct and co-ordinate:
.	(a) all anti-terrorist operations;
(b)	all civilian emergency measures;
(c)	all security intelligence;
(d)	information and propaganda; ;and
(e)	as a follow up, social improvements.
It is logical that these Headquarters should be the present 3rd Corps reinforced by Administrative, Civil Guard, Self-Defence Corps and Propaganda elements. There is great advantage in the fact that the Corps Headquarters itself is based in the Saigon area where the best facilities for control are available.
5.	This would make it desirable to relieve this headquarters of any responsibility for the 3lst tactical sone and for the special zone of Saigon, and it is for consideration, whether these two zones could best be handled by Field Army Headquarters as a separate command

command or, perhaps, incorporated into 2nd Corps. The Combined Headquarters at 3rd Corps should cease to be responsible to Field Army Headquarters (which can then concentrate on the area north of Saigon and the Highlands), and should be directly responsible * to the National Security Council presided over by His Excellency the President. The Corps and all ifs military units vzould, however, continue to draw logistical support from the H.Q. A.R.V.N.
The Tactical Zones
6.	Given this one Combined Headquarters for the whole area, the 32nd and 33rd Tactical Zones as such are no longer necessary. Instead there would only be an operational dividing line between the two divisions but this would be changeable, depending both on the situation and on the operations planned. This will allow such greater flexibility with regard to the movement of military forces throughout the whole area.
Provinces	.
7	. It follows from this that the chefs de Province will be directly responsible to the Combined Headquarters on all emergency matters (though they will continue to work to the Ministries concerned in respect of normal routine administration). The Chef de Province should remain responsible for the direction and co-ordination of all emergency measures in his Province and the District chefs should similarly remain responsible to their respective Chefs de Province. Bearing in mind that most of them are military officers this is likely to be more satisfactory in the present circumstances than the Malayan District or Executive Committee system. This system should only be developed gradually as military Chefs de Province can be replaced by civil administrators.
Command'Channels
8.	(a) The military chain of command will operate in the normal way, from the Military Corps staff at the Combined Headquarters to the two Divisional Headquarters and thence to regiments and battalions. It may be desirable for Ranger Companies, specifically attached to a particular Province, to come under the operational command of the Chef de Province, but the latter should not command any army battalion or regiment operating in his province. He should, however, be responsible for co-ordinating operations with the commander of that battalion or regiment, as the case may be.

From Saigon
(b) The Chef de Province will, however, be responsible for
all civil emergency measures and their direction and, in that respect, will exercise command over the civil departments concerned.
(c) Civil Guard and Self-Defence command channels are dis-
cussed in paragraphs 17 and 14 below.
Civil Measures
9.	The basic units of population are the village and Hamlet. Although the sizes vary, there are normally about 4 to 5 Hamlets of 200-300 houses to each village. The main civil emergency measures required at this level are:
(a)	regrouping of hamlets round the perimeter i.e. along the Cambodian frontier and on the fringes of the mangrove swamp areas, particularly those which have become long established communist bases. These hamlets should be known as "defended Hamlets"; and
(b)	the establishment of "strategic hamlets" in the remainder of the area.
10.	The establishment of a "Cordon Sanitaire" along this part of the frontier (or elsewhere on the perimeter) is not desirable, except possibly at special points, because:
(a)	it gives up ground;
(b)	it eliminates intelligence coverage;
(c)	it establishes a more or less permanent patrol commitment for either Civil Guard or Military forces; and
(d)	it still does not solve the problem of the populated areas wherever they may start.
Regrouping of hamlets is likely to prove a better solution provided that they are of a convenient size for defence and control and the inhabitants are not moved too far from their normal work. Regrouped villages might be too big and unwieldy and cause too drastic a move of the population. The ideal size for a defended hamlet is about 300 houses (8-10 to an acre).
Control measures
11.	(a) Prohibited areas from which the population is totally
excluded until further notice should be declared and all Government forces should have complete freedom to shoot on sight in such areas;
/(b) Curfews

Enclosure No. 2 Despatch No. 205 From Saigon
(b)	Curfews, particularly at night, should be introduced on certain roads and waterways, in areas surrounding defended hamlets and in such other areas as may be required. Anyone breaking the curfew should be liable to be shot on sight.
(c)	Identity cards should be issued to the whole population and the Delta area should be given priority for the new plastic cards. The inhabitants of each house should be recorded (as is being done in most strategic hamlets) and a photograph of the complete household should be pinned inside the house with duplicates available at district and province level (as in Vinh Binh province).
(d)	Check points should be established on all roads and waterways. There should also be surprise checks at other points. This will help to prevent the present freedom of movement enjoyed by communist agents and couriers.	.
(e)	It may be possible to introduce a limited degree of food ' control (and of other supplies) particularly in the areas where defended hamlets are established.
Self-Defence Corps
12.	I was very impressed with the good progress being made with the establishment of the self-Defence Corps ;and Self-Defence Corps' posts (particularly in Kien Hoa, Vinh Binh and Vinh Long Provinces) based on strategic hamlets with a larger post at village level. The potentiality of this policy is tremendous and the Self-Defence Corps could be made the key to the whole situation. Although the pay is low' and the equipment is still poor, the necessary spirit seems to be there and should be easily encouraged. If this is done successfully, the great advantage will lie in the fact that the people are defending themselves. Their local intelligence is good and provided that'they are given sufficient confidence not to fear reprisals, they wil _ pick off communist agents and supporters and small guerrilla units. (In one of the Provinces visited they have the highest score of kills over the last few months).
13.	The pay problem might be solved by making the permanent members more part-time on a roster basis so that they can still attend to some of their normal work. With regard to equipment I hope that carbines can soon be issued. Every post should, however, also have a grenade discharger. Other minor equipment and'better uniform would greatly improve morale. Each post should also have a Very pistol or at least a rocket. The drum seems to be very adequate for raising * the alarm within the hamlet its.elf.
14.	Being essentially a force which operates only at the villao-e and hamlet level no elaborate chain of command is required above that level. A very small staff is required at District level to

ensure co-ordination between the villages and to the intelligence aspect and similarly at the Province level. Above that there should only be an inspectorate, the main purpose of which should be to visit posts as frequently as possible to find out their needs, stay with them and help them to understnad the importance of their mission. The Civil Guard at Province and District level should be responsible for logistic and administrative support.
15.	A prerecuisite for the establishment of Self-Defence Corps units, including their posts in strategic and defended hamlets, is that they can be adequately and rapidly supported by Civil Guard units in the event of an attack developing and, in turn, the Army should be responsible for dealing with any large concentration which may develop against such hamlets. It would be fatal to establish such units and posts before this support can be provided. Training is not a major problem as only a minimum is required and in many places there are a number of former soldiers. All peasants have a natural instinct for small scale guerrilla and anti-guerrilla operations.
Civil Guard
16.	The Civil Guard should be organised to provide the permanent static framework of the Government's security forces within each Province. Their present organisation on a battalion and company basis is desirable only for the purpose of equipment and retraining. Their subsequent deployment requires that battalion Headquarters should be the provincial headquarters with company headquarters becoming the district headquarters. Provinces should then be reinforced by additional companies as may be required particularly for mobile operations. As the security situation improves companies may be transferred elsewhere, except that a company headquarters must remain at district level even though the number of men in that particular company may be reduced. This means that the total strength of the Civil Guard in a Province can vary considerably but that the headquarters framework at the Province and District level must always remain.
17.	The operational direction of the Civil Guard in a Province should rest with the Chef de Province through the battalion commander and at district level with the District Chief through the company commander (when the Chef de Province and the Chef de District are military officers). In all other respects the command and administrative channel should go direct from the battalion commander to the Civil Guard element at the Combined Headquarters, and thence to the main
Civil Guard Headquarters in Saigon. As and when provinces are declared "white" and civil administrators are appointed as Chefs de
Province, then the whole command chain will run direct from Civil Guard headquarters in Saigon through Combined Headquarters to the Battalion Headquarters at Province level and thhnce to its companies.

It is this organisation which should then gradually be developed into a national police force with the amalgamation of other suitable forces.
Military Units (including Rangers)
•
18.	The initial aim of military units should be to keep the main communist forces off balance while the whole framework of defended and strategic hamlets is being developed and consolidated and their main tasks will therefore be:
(a)	active patrolling and engagement of communist terrorists outside the populated areas;
(b)	prevention by planned operations of communist terrorist concentration;
(c)	support of defended hamlets in bad areas and rescue of them if attacked;
(d)	enforcement of control measures especially curfews and prohibited areas.
19.	As the framework is established, military units should gradually be relieved of all static duties, except in defence of their own establishments and, where any static duties remain, a mobile reserve should always be available. This will be the time when the communists will either have to concentrate to attack the framework or else will withdraw to their bases in the swamp. Planned military operations will be necessary to deal with both these eventualities.
20.	In so far as the Delta area is concerned it would be desirable gradually to withdraw Ranger Companies as they can be replaced by retrained Civil Guard companies in order that the Ranger Companies themselves can be retrained for their proper task in the jungle areas north of Saigon and in the Highlands. But, as already stated, where they must initially remain allocated to a Province they should be under the operational command of the Chef de Province (when a military officer) and used in much the same role as mobile Civil Guard companies.
-
Air Force
21.	The main role of the Air Force should be to increase the mobility of the security forces in areas where other communications are lacking, It will also have the normal tasks of reconnaissance and communications and, where a suitable target presents irself, of ground attack. The priority task for helicopers should be the evacuation of wounded, including those from the Self-Defence Corps who should receive equally good treatment as the Army and Civil Guard.

Navy
22.	The main task of the Navy must be to prevent the entry of • supplies, reinforcements, agents and weapons by sea into the area. Simultaneously the Navy should prevent all communist movement by water along the coasts. At the present time large communist units are able to move rapidly from island to island across the mouth of the Delta with impunity. Not only should these be stopped completely but, if suitable craft are obtained and fitted with radar, there should be considerable slaughter on the first few occasions. The type of vessel required is a seaward defence motor launch, inshore mine sweeper, or sea-going customs launch (like the police P-craft as used in Malaya). They are all quite small with crews of between 10 and 15 men but they must be fitted with radar, wireless, search light, at least one 20 mm. and machine guns. They should carry sufficient fuel and stores to stay at sea for about 7 days.
Inland Waterways
23-	with regard to the Mekong itself and other inland waterways this should not be a naval task (although the Navy may be required to help for a specific period or operation). River patrol units are required in the Civil Guard (as in Kien Hoa Province). It is understood that small landing craft suitable for troop movement and patrolling of the Mekong are being provided. These should be very adequate bu, in addition, there will also be a requirement for smaller and faster boats, possibly fibre glass with outboard motor, capable of carrying about 6 men. In the initial stages these should be used, if based on static control points, to check traffic up and down the rivers and, in the later stages when security has improved, for patrolling and quick communications.
Roads ’ •— — "
24.	Some Civil Guard battalions now have a road partol platoon at Provincial Headquarters using mainly former Malayan G.M.C.1s and Lynx scout cars. These are all very old and problems are arising with regard to spare parts and tyres. For the future it is considered that a light armoured car to take the place of these vehicles is essential. As far as I know the only one being produced is the United Kingdom Ferret scout car and this is due to go out of production in 196?. It may be possible to make a final order. Its cost is about L 15,000 excluding spares. If this cannot be done then the best solution is to devise a fairly simple system of armour plating jeeps and light trucks (as was in fact done in Malaya).
Wireless Communications
25.	These will need to be gone into in some detail to see that they all tie in correctly. At the lowest level strategic hamlets may have' to communicate with the village by courier, flare or rocket but at village level the Self-Defence Corps certainly needs a simple

Information and Propaganda
29.	A strong section must be established at the Corps Headquarters covering all fields of information and propaganda from the radio . downwards. It is essential that a common line should be taken throughout the whole area on every subject. In the field at provincial level, however,mobile units are required (both boats and jeeps) in order that every hamlet can be visited as frequently as possible. In addition each hamlet should have a receiving set (as already supplied by Australia under the Colombo Plan). Greater use also needs to be made of leaflets to be dropped either by patrols or by aircraft and for this purpose the Combined Corps Headquarters should either have under its control, or should be able to call on, adequate printing resources. Voice aircraft would also be a tremendous asset particularly for exploiting successful action and any surrenders.
Social improvements
30.	It may not be p.'ssible to introduce the necessary social improvements simutaneously with the emergency measures already enumerated but they should follow as soon as possible particularly when an area becomes ’white' with emphasis on improved schools and medical facilities. Much good work to the effect was already being done in the provinces visited. Such measures should, however, be undertaken in defended hamlets simultaneously with regrouping in order to demonstrate the advantages of such a measure. In defended hamlets it may also be desirable to install small generating sets capable of providing in the first instance perimeter and street lighting. The inhabitants should be informed that as soon as the Communists have been elimated these generating sets may then be used to provide house lighting in the hamlet.
Civic Action
31.	There is great scope for Civic Action and Youth Corps cadres particularly in relation to the activities covered in the last two paragraphs. All this requires careful co-ordination so that the timing of all activities are properly related to the establishment of strategic and defended hamlets and to military operations.
Compensation, Rewards and Subsidies
32.	Funds should be provided by the central Government at provincial level to pay immediate compensation to the members or families of the Self-Defence Corps and any other innocent person who is wounded or killed by the communists. The present system tends to be too slow and the amounts may often be inadequate. Funds should also be available

for the payment of rewards to members of the Self-Defence Corps and any other person (not a member of the security forces) for information leading to the killing of communists and the capture of weapons. It is desirable to produce a set scale which should be uniform throughout the country. Subsidies may also be necessary in cases where houses are regrouped into defended hamlets. A sum of about Piastres 2,500 for each house which has to be moved would not be unreasonable particularly if roofing material was also supplied free.
Summary of Material and Equipment Requirements
33.	(a) Coastal and river patrol craft;
(b)	Wireless communications;
(c)	Better equipment for the self-Defence Corps including carbines, grenade dischargers, uniforms, flare pistols (or rockets);	_
(d)	Helicopters;
(e)	Large quantities of barbed wire; (It is understood that Chefs de Province are having to buy barbed wire for this purpose from provincial funds in the open market. This should be a central Government commitment).
(f)	Mobile information units and small receiving sets;
(g)	Suitably packed medical supplies for defended and strategic hamlets;
(h)	Roofing material - either corrugated iron, aluminum or .	asbestos (if regrouping is carried out on any scale
this is bound to be a bottle neck and even supplies of nipah palm may not be available in the right places in sufficient quantity);
(i)	Pyres for present Civil Guard scout cars and their eventual replacement either by fcrrets or armour plated jeeps or land revers;and
(j)	Small generating sets and perimeter lighting for defended' hamlets.
Results
34.	The main results of establishing a framework as proposed should be:
(a)	protection for the population;
(b)	increased mobility for the security forces particularly the Army;
(c)	greater flexibility in the use of forces where required at any given time in the whole area:
(d)	with mobility and flev'bility and improved communications there should also be greater econoipy of force;
(e)	all this will instill greater confidence both in the population and in the security forces;

(f)	this, in turn, will lead to better intelligence; and (g) better intelligence will result in more kills. .
Protection, confidence, intelligence and kills should become a sonstantly expanding circuit. \
Communist reaction
35.	The Communists will not be slow to react and will make a determined effort to prevent the framework being established particularly . at the village and hamlet level. This requires that there should be careful judgement and timing in its establishment. As it grows, so break it. That is the time for the security forces, and particularly the Army, to get them. Once the communist rank and file starts to break the leaders will attempt to withdraw, preferably over the frontier where they will be safe, but, if that is denied to them, then into the more inaccessible mangrove swamps in the coastal area where they can be steadily starved out and eliminated.
Priority Areas
36.	Even within the Delta itself these measures cannot all be carried out simultaneously in every Province or District. First priority should be given to the Provinces along the Mekong with the intention of clearing a corridor through the middle of the whole area along its easiest axis. In fact regrouping should start there as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the damage caused by the floods. The main intention in this area, however, would be initially to prevent further infiltration and subsequently to deny the frontier as a safe refuge. The final aim should be to push thc communists back into the Mangrove swamps along the coast where they can do little harm and where they can then be starved out and eliminated.
Summary of Expected Achievements
37.	(a) The first achievement should be a cleared corridor along the line of the Mekong followed by
(b)	the declaration of 'white' areas ir the provinces concerned which will raise the morale of the whole country;
(c)	the safeguarding of the rice crop;
(d)	the release of troops from the Delta area for the more specific military operations North of Saigon and in the Highlands;

TOP SECRET	November 11, 1961
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject: South Viet-Nam
1.	United States National Interests in South Viet-Nam.
The deteriorating situation in South Viet-Nam requires attention to the nature and scope of United States national interests in that country. The loss of South Viet-Nam to Communism would involve the transfer of a nation of 20 million people from the free world to the Communist bloc. The loss of South Viet-Nam would make pointless any further discussion about the importance of Southeast Asia to the free world; we would have to face the near certainty that the remainder of Southeast Asia and Indonesia would move to a complete accommodation with Communism, if not formal incorporation within the Communist bloc. The United States, as a member of SEATO, has commitments with respect to South Viet-Nam under the Protocol to the SEATO Treaty. Additionally, in a formal statement at the conclusion session of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the United States representative stated that the United States "would view any renewal of the aggression . . . with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security."
The loss of South Viet-Nam to Communism would not only destroy SEATO but would undermine the credibility of American commitments I	elsewhere. Further, loss of South Viet-Nam would stimulate bitter
domestic controbersies in the United States and would be seized upon by extreme elements to divide the country and harass the Admin-istrati on.
2.	The Problem of Saving South Viet-Nam 	------------------------------------
It seems, on the face of it, absurd to think that a nation of 20 million people can be subverted by 15-20 thousand active guerrillas
if

if the Government and people of that country do not wish to be subverted. South Viet-Nam is not, however, a highly organized society with an effective governing apparatus and a population accustomed to carrying civic responsibility. Public apathy is encouraged by the inability of most citizens to act directly as -well as by the tactics of terror employed by the guerrillas throughout the countryside. Inept administration and the absence of a strong non-Communist political coalition have made it difficult to bring available resources to bear upon the guerrilla problem and to make the most effective use of available external aid. Under the best of conditions the threat posed by the presence of 15-20 thousand guerrillas, well disciplined under well-trained cadres, would be difficult to meet.
3.	The United States' Objective in South Viet-Nam —
The United States should commit itself to the clear objective of preventing the fall of South Viet-Nam to Communism. The basic means for accomplishing this objective must be to put the Government of South Viet- Nam into a position to win its own war against the guerrillas, we must insist that that Government itself take the measures necessary for that purpose in exchange for large-scale United States assistance in the military, economic and political fields. At the same time we must recognize that it will probably not be possible for the GVN to win this war as long as the flow of men and supplies from North Viet-Nam continues unchecked and the guerrillas enjoy a safe sanctuary in neighboring territory.
Ue should be prepared to introduce United States combat forces if that should become necessary for success. Dependent upon the I	circumstances, it may also be necessary for United States forces to
strike at the source of the aggression in North Viet-Nam.
4.	The Use of United States Forces in South Viet-Nam.
The commitment of United States forces to South Viet-Nam involves two different categories: (A) Units of modest size required for the direct support of South Viet-Namese military effort, such as communications, helicopter and other forms of airlift, reconnaissance aircraft, naval patrols, intelligence units, etc., and (B) larger organized units with actual or potential direct military missions. Category (A) should be introduced as speedily as possible. Category (b) units pose a more serious problem in that they are much more significant from the point of view of domestic and international political factors and greatly increase the probabilities of Communist bloc escalation. Further, the employment of United States combat forces
(in
TOP SECRET

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
-3-
(in the absence of Communist bloc escalation) involves a certain dilemma: if there is a strong South Viet-Namese effort, they may not be needed; if there is not such an effort, United States forces could not accomplish their mission in the midst of an apathetic or hostile population. Under present circumstances, therefore, the question of injecting United States and SEATO combat forces should * in large part be considered as a. contribution to the morale of the South Viet-Namese in their own effort to do the principal job themselves.
5.	Probable Extent of the Commitment of United States Forces.
If we commit Category (B) forces to South Viet-Nam, the ultimate possible extent of our military commitment in Southeast Asia must be faced. The struggle may be prolonged, and Hanoi and Peiping may overtly intervene. It is the view of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, in the light of the logistic difficulties faced by the other side, we can assume that the maximum United States forces required on the ground in Southeast Asia would not exceed six divisions, or about 205,000 men (CINCPAC Plan 32/59 Phase IV). This would be in addition to local forces and such SEATO forces as may be engaged. It is also the view of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that our military posture is, or, with the addition of more National Guard or regular Army divisions, can be made, adequate to furnish these forces and support them in action without serious interference with our present Berlin plans.
6.	Relation to Laos.
It must be understood that the introduction of American combat forces into Viet-Nam prior to a Laotian settlement would run a considerable risk of stimulating a Communist breach of the cease fire and a resumption of hostilities in Laos. This could present us with a choice between the use of combat forces in Laos or an abandonment of that country to full Communist control. At the present time, there is at least a chance that a settlement can be reached in Laos on the basis of a weak and unsatisfactory Souvanna Phouma Government. The prospective agreement on Laos includes a provision that Laos will not be used as a transit area or as a base for interfering in the affairs of other countries such as South Viet-Nam. After a Laotian settlement the introduction of United States forces into Viet-Nam could serve to stabilize the position both in Viet-Nam and in Laos by registering our determination to see to it that the Laotian settlement was as far as the United States would be willing to see Communist influence in Southeast Asia develop.

7.	The Need for Multilateral Action.
From the political point of view, both domestic and international, it would seem important to involve forces from other nations alongside of United States Category (B) forces in Viet-Nam. It would be difficult to explain to our own people why no effort had been made tp invoke SEATO or why the United States undertook to carry this burden unilaterally. Our position would be greatly strengthened if the introduction of forces could be taken as a SEATO action, accompanied by units of other SEATO countries, with a full SEATO report to the United Nations of the purposes of the action itself.
Apart from the armed forces, there would be political advantage in enlisting the interest of other nations, including neutrals, in the security and well-being of South Viet-Nam. This might be done by seeking such assistance as Malayan police officials (recently offered Diem by the Tumka) and by technical assistance personnel in other fields, either bilaterally or through international organizations.
8.	Initial Diplomatic Action by the United States.
If the recommendations, below, are approved, the United States should consult intensively with other SEATO governments to obtain their full support of the course of action contemplated. At the appropriate stage, a direct approach should be made by the United States to Moscow, through normal or special channels, pointing out that we cannot accept the movement of cadres, arms and other supplies into South Viet-Nam in support of the guerrillas. We should also discuss the problem with neutral governments in the general area and get them to face up to their own interests in the security of South Viet-Nam; these governments will be concerned about (a) the introduction of United States combat forces and (b) the withdrawal of United States support from Southeast Asia; their concern, therefore, might be usefully expressed either to Communist bloc countries or in political support for what may prove necessary in South Viet-Nam itself.
RECOMMENDATIONS
In the light of the foregoing, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense recommend that:
1.	We now take the decision to commit ourselves to the objective of preventing the fall of South Viet-Nam to Communism and that, in doing so, we recognize that the introduction of United States and other

SEATO forces may be necessary to achieve this objective. (However, if it is necessary to commit outside forces to achieve the foregoing objective, our decision to introduce United States forces should not be contingent upon unanimous SEATO agreement thereto.)
2.	The Department of Defense be prepared with plans for the * use of United States forces in South Viet-Nam under one or more of the following purposes:
(a)	Use of a significant number of United States forces to signify United States determination to defend South Viet-Nam and to boost South Viet-Nam morale.
(b)	Use of substantial United States forces to assist in suppressing Viet Cong insurgency short of engaging in detailed counter-guerrilla operations but including relevant operations in North Viet-Nam.
(c)	Use of United States forces to deal with the situation if there is organized Communist military-intervention.
3.	We immediately undertake.the following actions in support of the GVN:
(a)	Provide increased air lift to the GVN forces, including helicopters, light aviation, and transport aircraft, manned to the extent necessary by United States uniformed personnel and under United States operational control.
(b)	Provide such additional equipment and United States uniformed personnel as may be necessary for air reconnaissance, photography, instruction in and execution of air-ground support techniques, and for special intelligence.
(c)	Provide the GVN with small craft, including such United States uniformed advisers and operating personnel as may be necessary for quick and effective operations in effecting surveillance and control over coastal waters and inland waterways.
(d)	Provide expedited training and equipping of the civil guard and the self-defense corps with the objective of relieving the regular Army of static missions and freeing it for mobile offensive operations.
(e)	Provide such personnel and equipment as may be necessary to improve the military-political intelligence system beginning

at the provincial level and extending upward through the Government and the armed forces to the Central Intelligence Organization.
(f)	Provide such new terms of reference, reorganization • and additional personnel for United States military forces as are required for increased United States participation in the direction and control of GVN military operations and to carry out the other increased responsibilities which accrue to MAAG under these recommendations.
(g)	Provide such increased economic aid as may be required to permit the GVN to pursue a vigorous flood relief and rehabilitation program, to supply material in support of the security effort, and to give priority to projects in support of this expanded counter-insurgency program. (This could include increases in military pay, a full supply of a wide range of materials such as food, medical supplies, transportation equipment, communications equipment, and any other items where material help could assist the GVN in winning thc war against the Viet Cong.)
■	(h) Encourage and support (including financial support)
a request by the GVN to the FAO or any other appropriate international organization for multilateral assistance in the relief and rehabilitation of the flood area.
(i)	Provide individual administrators and advisers for insertion into thc Governmental machinery of South Viet-Nam in types and numbers to be agreed upon by the two Governments.
(j)	Provide personnel for a joint survey with the GVN of conditions in each of the provinces to assess the social, political, inteIligence, and military factors bearing on the prosecution of the counter-insurgency program in order to reach a common estimate of these factors and a common determination of how to deal with them.
4.	Ambassador Nolting be instructed to make an immediate approach to President Diem to the effect that the Government of the United States is prepared to join the Government of Viet-Nam in a sharply increased joint effort to cope with the Viet Cong threat and the ravages of the flood as set forth under 3., above, if, on its part, the Government of Viet-Nam is prepared to carry out an effective and total mobilization of its own resources, both material and human, for the same end. Before setting in motion the United States proposals

listed above, the United States Government would appreciate confirmation of their acceptability to the GVN, and an expression from the GVN of the undertakings it is prepared to make to insure the success of this joint effort. On the part of the United States, it would be expected that these GVN undertakings would include, in accordance with the detailed recommendations of the Taylor Mission and the Country Team: ■	•
(a)	Prompt and appropriate legislation and administrative action to put the nation on a wartime footing to mobilize its entire resources. (This would include a decentralization and broadening of the Government so as to realize the full potential of all non-Communist elements in the country willing to contribute to the common struggle.)
(b)	The establishment of appropriate Governmental wartime agencies with adequate authority to perform their functions effectively.
(c)	Overhaul of the military establishment and command structure so as to create an effective military organization for the prosecution of the war.
5.	Very shortly before the arrival in South Viet-Nam of the first increments of United States military personnel and equipment proposed under 3«> above, that would exceed the Geneva Accord ceilings, publish the "Jorden report" as a United States "white paper," transmitting it as simultaneously as possible to the Governments of all countries with which we have diplomatic relations, including the Communist states.
6.	Simultaneous with the publication of the "Jorden report," release an exchange of letters between Diem and the President.
(a)	Diem’s letter would include: reference to the DRV violations of Geneva Accords as set forth in the October 24 GVN letter to the ICC and other documents; pertinent references to GVN statements with respect to its intent to observe the Geneva Accords; reference to its need for flood relief and rehabilitation; reference to previous United States aid and the compliance hitherto by both countries with the Geneva Accords; reference to the USG statement at the time the Geneva Accords were signed; the necessity now of exceeding some provisions of the Accords in view of the DRV violations thereof; the lack of aggressive intent with respect to the DRV: GVN intent to return to strict compliance with the Geneva Accords

as soon as the DRV violations ceased; and request for additional United States assistance in framework foregoing policy. The letter should also set forth in appropriate general terms steps Diem has taken and is taking to reform Governmental structure.
(b)	The President’s reply would be responsive to Diem’s * request for additional assistance and acknowledge and agree to Diem's statements on the intent promptly to return to strict compliance with the Geneva Accords as soon as DRV violations have ceased.
7.	Simultaneous with steps 5. and 6., above, make a private approach to the Soviet Union that would include: our determination to prevent the fall of South Viet-Nam to Communism by whatever means is necessary; our concern over dangers to peace presented by the aggressive DRV policy with respect to South Viet-Nam; our intent to return to full compliance with the Geneva Accords as soon as the DRV does so, the distinction we draw between Laos and South Viet-Nam; and our expectation that the Soviet Union will exercise its influence on the Chicoms and the DRV.	.
8.	A special diplomatic approach made to the United Kingdom in its role as co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference requesting that the United Kingdom seek the support of the Soviet co-Chairman for a cessation of DRV aggression against South Viet-Nam.
9.	A special diplomatic approach also to be made to India, both in its role as Chairman of the ICC and as a power having relations with Peiping and Hanoi. This approach should be made immediately prior to public release of the "Jorden report” and the exchange of letters between Diem and the President.
10.	Immediately prior to the release of the "Jorden report" and the exchange of letters between Diem and the President, special diplomatic approaches also to be made to Canada, as well as Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, Ceylon, the UAR, and Yugoslavia. SEATO, NATO, and OAS members should be informed through these organizations, with selected members also informed individually. The possibility of some special approach to Poland as a member of the ICC should also be considered.

3.	In connection with paragraph 1 of the draft memorandum, the Joint Staff considers it militarily desirable to preposition forces and equipment and is currently considering augmentation of US Army forces Pacific with one infantry division plus appropriate logistic and combat support units. CINCPAC has recommended that, in consideration of the requirement to locate army forces in close proximity to Southeast Asia, this division be prepositioned in the Philippines. The Army has established a Pacific Forward Depot on Okinawa for prestocking essential non-air-transportable items of materiel required for a one diVision force. In addition, there are ammunition stocks in Japan. There are also limited prestocks of aviation fuel and ammunition in Thailand for use by the USAF. Prestocks have not been established in South Vietnam. CINCPAC has recommended and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have concurred in the additional prestocking of railroad rolling . ,

Paragraph 2. (b) (2) INSTRUCTION IM AND EXECUTION OF •' AIR GROUND SUPPORT TECHNIQUES
STATUS: PACAF, in coordination with. CINCPAC and USAF, is presently studying the feasibility of establishing a limited Tactical Air Control System (TACS) in South Vietnam. TACS has three obj'ectiVes: (1) Teach and train Vietnamese;
(2) ProVide a structure to apply Vietnamese air capability; and (3) Establish framework for control of US air effort. Plan presently envisions that TACS would be under US command and control. It would provide a Joint Opperations Center (JOC), a Control and Reporting Center (CRC) at Tan Son Nhut, a Control and Reporting Point (CRP) at Tourane, two Air Support Operations ’ Centers (ASOC), and Forward Air Controllers. The two ASOCs vzould be co-located with the two northernmost Army corps. The southernmost corp would be directly supported by the JOC.
A suitably modified course of instruction from the air/ground operations school would be deployed to furnish comprehensiVe training for Vietnamese Army and Air Force Personnel. Vietnamese personnel would participate directly in system operation. The Jungle-Jim detachment could handle training of Vietnamese T-28 pilots and indoctrination of these pilots in the air to ground support role. AD-6 pilot indoctrination is within the capability of the HAAG adVisors now assigned to the AD squadron.

a.	Civil Guard: Increased effort in this basic task has been progressing since January lOeO when the Civil Guard vzas transferred to the GVN Department of Defense. Enlargement of this program is being actiVely pursued; acceleration time-wise to obtain trained units is difficult, particularly in View of a shortage of trained leaders and priority requirements'for the . ARVN.	'	..
Additional training sites and input have been recently approved. Additional US adVisors are enroute to assist in this training. Officer and NCO training has been stepped-up but prospects for a short term leadership solution are not encouraging. Chief HAAG is currently working on providing additional interpreters to permit greater usc of more US advisors.
b.	Self Defense Corps (SDC): Subject to the indiVidual desires of ProVince Chiefs, the SDC has achieVed no real uniformity of organization or training. HoweVer, these locally available citizens are being equipped, and additional US
advisors are being made available during the next three months to take over training duties at the SDC training sites throughout the country.

PRESENT STATUS	’	'	,
The CIA representative on the Taylor Mission was responsible for recommendations in the political intelligence field. The status of those recommendations is not known.
In the military intelligence field the Military Committee made the following three basic recommendations:
a.	Establish a joint US-GVN Military Intelligence Group, under the control of Chief HAAG, to direct the South Vietnamese national intelligence effort. This recommendation was also submitted by CINCPAC on 14 NoVember 1561 with a request for approximately 150 additional manpower spaces. This request is now being staffed by the Joint Staff. .•
b.	Enlarge in size and scope the US EValuations Center in Saigon to enable that agency to properly evaluate and disseminate all available intelligence bearing on the security of South
’ Vietnam. This recommendation was. approved by the JCS and OSD on 9 November 1951.
c.	Increase the number of Intelligence Advisors in HAAG and proVide intelligence adVisors at the province level. This recommendation was also submitted by CINCPAC on 14 November and is now being staffed by the Joint Staff.

Paragraph 2f PROVIDE NEW TERMS OF REFERENCE, REORGANIZATION AND ADDITIONAL US PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT US PARTICIPATION IN DIRECTION AND CONTROL OF GVN MILITARY OPERATIONS AND EXPENDED MAAG FUNCTIONS ■ >
STATUS: Under its present terms of reference, MAAG Vietnam is not directed to participate actively in operations, operational planning and intelligence activities. There are, currently, no MAAG advisors at any level of combat command solely responsible for intelligence. In addition, there is a requirement to provide unit advisors at battalion and selected company level throughout the RVNAF, the Civil Guard, and the Self Defense Corps. Under current directives, US advisors do not fully participate in planning for and conduct of operations. In order to be successful against the Viet Cong, operations must be carefully planned, coordinated, and energetically implemented. Vietnamese officers are not as well qualified in this area as available US military advisors who, by their experience, schooling, and higher professional standings, could supply the much needed know-how, techniques, knowledge of joint and com-
.	bined operations and the vigor required. If US personnel were
working continuously in the various operations centers, CHMAAG would know the true situation at all times and keep abreast of new requirements as they arose.
PERSONNEL: In order to provide for essential MAAG assistance to RVNAF in the operations, operational planning, unit advisor, and intelligence fields, it is estimated that the authorized strength of MAAG Vietnam should be raised from the present

To Director, CIA, From Bangkok, 20 November 1961 For The President From Ambassador Galbraith
I have just completed three intensive days in Saigon which, with CINCPAC talks, gives me a much better feeling for this tangled situation. Tomorrow night I am sending you a full and, I trust rather close analysis which I pray you read at average speed. That concerns our longer course but meanwhile I must register conclusions on two or three matters on which action may be pending and I add a general thought or two.
(1)	There is scarcely the slightest practical chance that the administrative and political reforms now being pressed upon Diem will result in real change. They reckon without deeper political realities and insecurities of his position and the nature of politicians of this age. He will promise but he will not perform because it' is most unlikely that he can perform. Accordingly, it is important that in exchange of letters which I suppose now to be inevitable that our proposed aid be geared to demonstrated action not promises. This may slightly increase the effect. But mostly it will keep us from what otherwise will be-a purely one-sided commitment to Diem. In the absence of fundamental reform, the help we are now proposing will not save the situation.

(2)	In my judgement, in the immediate situation there should be no, repeat no, change in either political or MAAG leadership.
■ Political leadership is using accumulated capital to get whatever slight administrative and political improvement may result from this initiative. MAAG change would, in my judgement, set back whatever slight chance there is for military reforms and sensible counterinsurgency action.
(3)	while situation is indubitablybad, military aspects seem to me out of perspective. A comparatively well-equipped army with para-military formations numbering a quarter million men is facing a maximum of fifteen to eighteen thousand lightly armed men. If this were equality, the United States would hardly be safe against the Sioux. I know the theories about this kind of warfare.
(4)	The foregoing, among other things, leads me to believe that your decision against troop commitment was wholly sound and with full discount for my high threshold on this matter. Decisive military factor is not manpower or even confidence but bad organization, incompetent use and deployment of forces, inability to protect territory once cleared, and probably poor political base. American forces would not correct this. Their inability to do so would create a worse crisis of confidence as this became evident.

.	(5) I note that problem of confidence is partly our making.
There is a fashionable tendency, though not by most senior military and diplomatic figures, to depict your decision of last spring on Laos as a disaster without any reference to alternatives available. This flows over to local community. Word should be passed down that when we make the best of bad alternatives second guessing of this sort does no service.
(6)	As I will argue, there is no solution that does not involve a change of government. To say there is no alternative is nonsence for there never has seemed to be where one man has dominated the scene. So while we must play out the ineffective and hopeless course on which we are launched for a little while, we must look ahead very soon to a new government. On this more later. Given an even moderately effective government and putting the relative military power into perspective, I can't help thinking that the insurgency might very soon be settled.
(7)	As I shall argue more fully in my letter, the diplomatic initiative should of course go forward. But I am convinced that the insurrection has more internal material base and less to meet it than I had previously imagined. Accordingly, the calling off of or stopping

of outside materiel support as distinct from encouragement and guidance might not make too much difference.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY
SUBJECT: Command Arrangements for Vietnam
' Mr. Nitze and I have examincd the JCS paper, and believe that it represents the best possible current solution. The following points may be noted;
C
a.	The fact that we have parallel command arrangements in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan should remove most of thc possible political disadvantage of having a US "commander" in a situation where Goneya calls for our having only an advisory ro1e.
b.	Under the President's letter of May 29, a US "conmander" becomes coequal with the Ambassador. (See page 6 of the JCS views for text dIStinguishing this from the MAAG.)
I recommend that we either elevate Gcneral McGarr promptly to the ne/t position, or find a, repl acement soonest.
I Re General Lansdale, General McCarr has scnt two messages ■by special channels reporting disappointment by Diem that no de-idsion has been made on Ed's coming back, (From these and other |indications, it is clear that McGarr himself would favor this.) I In spite of the importance of Ed's current assignment, I think :he belongs in Vietnam, where he is of unique value.

Ihe Importance of both these points is underscored by Noltino's inegattve talks with both Diem and Thuan. We badIy need someth — .to sweeten the mixture. You may have seen the report in today's ■Post (page opposite the editorial page) that the Saigon controlled press has sharply criticized the US, a most novel and disturbina {symptom.	a

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JCS
SUBJECT: Vietnamese Command Problem
CINCPAC's message to you, 232137Z December 1961, outlines the problem of President Diem giving control authority to Big Minh as his military field commander, when Diem is apprehensive of a coup. CINCPAC then solicited your help to get State to direct Ambassador Nolting to make a concerted approach to Diem with General McGarr.
In CINCPAC’s proposal, as in other comments on this problem, I have yet to note anyone come up with an answer to Diem’s apprehension. It is the basis for his real reluctance to do what the Americans want him to do, and this basic point needs resolving. How are Nolting and McGarr to reassure him on this point?
U. S. policy is to support Diem and he has been so informed by the President. We know that Big Minh has been outspoken about a coup. Diem certainly knows about the way Big Minh has been talking, also. Now we ask Diem to give practical control of his military force to a man who has talked about a coup. What realistic assurances can we give Diem that the action he fears won't take place?
It would seem that the increased U. S. military stake in Vietnam should afford some means for stabilizing the political relationships within the Vietnamese Armed Forces long enough for all concerned to get on with the war. Armed with facts about such a political stability, Nolting and McGarr should have little trouble in getting Diem to play ball.
