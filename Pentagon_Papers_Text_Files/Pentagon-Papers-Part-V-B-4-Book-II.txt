U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR — INTERNAL DOCUMENTS
The Kennedy Administration: January 1961 - November 1963
Foreword
This volume contains a collection of internal U.S. Government documents and position papers regarding U.S. policy toward Vietnam, The volume of materials for this period is so large as to preclude the inclusion in such a collection of more than a sample of the documents in the files. Those classified materials that are included, however, were circulated at the highest levels of the Government and either bore directly on the process of policy formation or were decision-making instruments. The collection is organized chronologically and devoted exclusively to the Kennedy years. A separate volume covers the Johnson Administration.

Chronological List of Documents
1961	Page
1.	General Lansdale reports on his January visit to Vietnam: "The U.S. should recognize that Vietnam is in a critical condition and should treat it as a combat area of the cold war..." He recommends strong support for Diem personally as the best available South Vietnamese leader, and the prompt transfer of Ambassador Durbrow, whose relations with Diem are poor. Memo for Secretary of Defense, 17 January 1961 ............................................................... 1
2.	Embassy Saigon, is advised that Kennedy has approved CounterInsurgency Plan (prepared by previous Administration) calling for increases in U.S. support for Vietnamese armed forces, contingent on reforms by Diem. State to Saigon
1054, 3 February 1961......................................   14
3.	The President requests the SecDef to examine means for	placing more emphasis on the development of counter guer-
rilla forces. NSAM 2, 3 February 1961.......................  17
4.	The Secretary of Defense is instructed to report his views on actions in the near future to launch guerrilla operations in Viet Minh territory. NSAM 28, 9 March 1961............... 18
5.	The JCS comment on the recommendations of Lt Gen Trapnell.
In addition to the Trapnell recommendations, the JCS suggest that the U.S. provide Defense support funds on the same basis for 170,000 forces as for 150,000; that the U.S. provide MAP support for the entire 68,OOO-man Civil Guard; and that the U.S. exploit these contributions to induce the GW to accept the Counter Insurgency Plan. Memorandum reflects conflict of views between MAAG and Embassy in Saigon.

6.	Unsigned paper, apparently by Lansdale, proposes a Presidential directive organizing a Task Force to come up with an approved plan of action in Vietnam. The goals of U.S. policy in Vietnam fall into three interrelated parts: (1) pacifi- . cation, (2) stabilization and (3) unification of Vietnam under anti-communist government. Tasks are outlined in this memorandum to accomplish these three goals. Paper in Deputy Secretary of Defense Task Force file, 19 April 1961.............. 22
7.	General Lansdale provides a detailed description of President Diem and his family apparently intended for Vice President Johnson’s use. Lansdale first met Diem in Saigon in 1954. "Here is our toughest ally...a 6O-year old bachelor who gave up romance with his childhood sweetheart...to devote his life to his country." Lansdale Memorandum for Deputy Secretary of Defense, 25 April 1961....................... 36
8.	In view of the serious military deterioration within South Vietnam and in order to accomplish the U.S. objective of preventing communist domination of the South, this first draft of the Vietnam Task Force report calls for a comprehensive political, economic and military program of U.S. support. Among other recommendations are an increase in MAAG and MAP and a visit by the Vice President in the near future. Task Force Draft "Program of Action," 26 April 1961............................................................. 42
•	9, The effect of a political settlement in Laos would be (1) to
inhibit U.S. assistance in preventing a communist take-over
' in SVN; and (2) to permit an expansion of the VC effort in SVN owing to the greater possibilities for uninhibited infiltration; and (3) give complete control to the North Vietnamese of the three passes through the Annaraite Mountains. With an expanded training program in SVN, however, the GVN should be able to defend itself even in the event of a Laotian settlement. Second Draft "Laos Annex" to Task Force report, 28 April 1961.................................. 58
10.	Attorney General Kennedy asks the question "where would be .	-
the best place to stand and fight in SEA — where to draw the line?" Secretary McNamara thinks the best place to take a stand is in Thailand and SVN. General Decker thinks there is no good place to fight in SEA. State Department Memorandum
of Conversation, 29 April 1961...............................    62
11,	Secretary Rusk decides at this meeting at the State Department that "we should not place combat forces in SVN at this time." Colonel Robert M. Levy Memorandum for Record, 5 Nay 1961................................................................. 67

12.	Final Draft of the Task Force Report recommends sending U.S. Battle Groups and an Engineer Battalion for training purposes; the assignment of coastal patrol missions to CHICPACFLT; and the air surveillance and close-support role to CINCPACAF. It also recommends the Vice-Presi-
• dential trip, a letter to Diem from Kennedy, increased FAP and other assistance, and a general U.S. commitment to support of Diem. Final Draft Task Force Report "A Program of Action," 6 May 1961............................................ 69.
13.	OSD requests the JCS to review and study the military advisability of possible commitment of U.S. forces to SVN. •Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum for Chairman, JCS, 8 May 1961......................................................... 131
14.	President Kennedy provides Vice President Johnson with a personal letter to present to President Diem. Kennedy suggests that, in addition to actions in the Counter-Insurgency Plan, the U.S. is prepared to: (1) augment the personnel of MAAG, (2) expand MAAG's duties, (3) provide
•	FAP support for the Civil Guard, and (4) provide support
for the Vietnamese Junk Force. President Kennedy letter to President Diem, 8 May 1961................................. 132
15.	The President makes the following decisions: (1) the U.S. objective is to prevent communist domination of SVN and to create in that country a viable and increasingly democratic society, (2) the President directs full examination of the size and composition of forces which would be desirable in the case of a possible commitment of U.S. forces to Vietnam, (3) finally, the President approves continuation of the special Task Force on Vietnam. The decisions of this NSAM are based on the report "A Program of Action to Prevent Communist Domination of SVN." NSAM 52, 11 May 1961...	136
16.	President Diem asserts that the recent developments in Laos emphasize the grave Vietnamese concern for the security of their country with its long and vulnerable frontiers. President Diem states that "as a small nation we cannot hope to meet all of our defense needs alone..." and expresses confidence that the Vietnamese needs will be given consideration in washington. President Diem letter to President Kennedy, 15 May 1961............................................... 155

"Much of the thinking has been on stationing U.S. combat forces in the high plateau...however, General williams has written a brief memorandum to me recommending such U.S. forces to be stationed on the coast..." Lansdale Memorandum for Deputy Secretary Gilpatric, 18 May 1961......
18.	The Vice President reports on his mission to SEA. Johnson feels, on the basis of his visit, that the situation in Laos has created doubt and concern about U.S. intentions throughout all of SEA. "No amount of success at Geneva can, of itself, erase this." It is Johnson’s impression that his mission arrested the decline of confidence in the U.S. "we didn’t buy time — we were given it. If these men I saw •at your request were bankers, I would know — without bothering to ask -- that there would be no further extensions of my note." The fundamental decision required of the U.S. is whether we are to attempt a major effort in support of the forces of freedom in the area or "throw in the towel." Johnson recommends "we proceed with a clearcut and strong program of action." Vice President Johnson Memorandum to President Kennedy, 23 May 1961.....................
19.	President Diem sends the U.S. a study on Vietnamese needs to meet the insurgency situation in the South. Diem suggests that, in light of the current situation, an additional 100,000 men above the new force level of 170,000 will be required to counter the threat of communist domination. Diem recommends a considerable expansion of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in SVN as an essential require-ment, and, finally, Diem expresses his mistrust of Sihanouk’s communist sympathies and antagonism of SVN. President Dietri letter to President Kennedy, 9’ June 1961....
20.	President Kennedy requests that the Secretary of Defense estimate requirements and make recommendations with respect to the anticipated future U.S. needs in the field of unconventional warfare and paramilitary operations. NSAM 56, 28 June 1961.....................................................
21.	Lansdale relates a conversation between Vice President Tho and Colonel Black. In discussing the Staley Mission, Tho concedes that it is impossible for the U.S. to provide SVN with piastres. The GVN feels an increase in piastre return per dollar would cause inflation and, in turn, an inevitable demand for wage increases. Tho further concedes that the basic problem in'VN is more political than economic. Tho's impression of the current situation in SVN is more pessimistic

22.	Mr. william P. Bundy forwards the joint action program pro-posed by the GVN-US. Special Financial Group to the Assistant Secretary of Defense. The report prepared by Dr. Eugene Staley, Chairman of the Group, has been submit-ted to President Ngo Diem and President John F. Kennedy, and includes the fiscal and economic implications of in-creasing the Vietnamese armed forces to 200,000 strength. The military portions, in addition to the requirements already planned, would require approximately $42 million, during the 18-month period, July 61-December 62. Bundy Memorandum to Gilpatric, 25 July 1961, (Slaley Report attached)...........................................................   177
23.	General Lionel C. McGarr, Chief, MAAG-Vietnam, reviews the military situation and offers recoinmendat I ons for continued improvement of the situation in SVN to President Diem. Among the recommendations made by McGarr are: (1) that a national internal security council be established to prepare and execute the Vietnamese National Counter Insurgency Plan; (2) that effective border and coastal surveillance capa-bilities be initiated; (3) that U.S. advincrs be more effectively utilized by accompanying ARVN units on combat operations; and (4) finally, that the reorganization of the military command structure and establishment of a single chain of command be implemented as recoinm-nded in the Counter Insurgency Plan. Aide-Memoire for President Diem, received Secretary of Defense, 2 August 1961.......................... 227
24.	The JCS do not believe that an alternate force of 270,000 would be required to enable the RVNAF to conduct counter-insurgency operations and, concurrently, be prepared to meet overt aggression. They recommend that the strategic force objectives for VN remain at the 9 division level (200 OCO) subject to further assessment. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 518-61, 3 Auguut 1961......................  39
25.	The President approves the Staley recommendations and decides that the U.S. will provide equipment and training assistance for an increased RVNAF from 170,000 to 200,000. It is hoped that President Diem will get the maximum mileage in terms of internal political support from this new commitment, and that he will involve more elements of the non-communist political opposition in the civic action program.

26.	The situation in North and South VN is analyzed and the scope of the communist threat to SVN is estimated for the following year. The analysis concludes that the DRV is in thorough political control in North VN and "when Ho is no longer active, there will probably be a struggle for power between the Moscow-oriented and the > Peking-oriented elements of the Party." Dissatisfaction continues in South VN with Diem’s leadership. The Army continues to be a major factor in future political developments in the South. The outlook is for a prolonged and difficult struggle between the VC insurgents and the GVN.
NIE 14.3/53-61, 15 August 1961.................................. 245
27.	The President approves the following actions: (1) intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve Souvanna’s agreement to the Paris proposals; (2) authorization to undertake conversations with SEATO allies on an enlarge-ment of the concept of SEATO Plan 5,' and (3) an increase in U.S. advisors in Laos. NSAM 80, 29 August 1961................ •	247
28.	The JCS sends the Secretary of Defense a draft memorandum for the President on military intervention in Laos. The JCS suggests that if the President decides that U.S. forces should be employed in Laos, that SEATO Plan 5 is the proper basic vehicle for the contemplated action. The political objective of the intervention is to confront the Sino-Soviet Bloc with a military force of Asian and western powers capable of stopping the communist advance. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 661-61, 20 September, 1961..........................................................   249
29.	The Bureau of Intelligence and Research assesses the crisis in South VN and analyzes the short term prospects. The study recognizes that communist progress toward its objective of overthrowing President Diem has been substantial. Since 1960, more than 6,500 civilians, officers, and military personnel have been killed or kidnapped. Recent U.S. support has raised Diem’s political stature, but there has been no conclusive reversal of deteriorating trends. The security situation remains unimproved. However, the Government’s comprehensive CIP, supported by U.S. aid, is beginning to show favorable results. Over the next year, developments in Laos may have more influence on VN than any improvement in the Diem Government. Department of State Research Memorandum RFE-1, 29 September 1961......................... 258
30.	It is estimated that present armed, full-time VC strength is about -16,000, an increase of 12,000 since April of 1960,

and of 4,000 in the past three months, while only 10-20^ , of this strength consists of cadres infiltrated from North VN, the remaining 80-90/6 includes remnants of the approximately 10,000 stay-behind personnel who went underground during the 19.54-1955 regroupment and evacuation of Vietnamese communist army units following the Indo-China war. Though some weapons and equipment have been infiltrated into South VN, there has been no positive identification of Communist Bloc-manufactured military equipment in South VN. SNIE 53-2-61, 5 October 1961................................ 291
31.	The JCS feel the time is now past when actions short of intervention by outside forces can reverse the rapidly worsening situation in Southeast Asia. They consider the execution of SEATO Plan 5, or a suitable variation thereof, to be the military minimum commensurate with the situation. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 704-61, 5 October 1961.......................................................   295
«
32.	It is the opinion of the JCS that the use of SEATO forces at the greatest possible number of entry points along the whole South VN border, i.e., over several hundred miles, is not feasible. Further, the alternative of using SEATO forces to cover solely the 17th parallel is militarily unsound. "what is needed is not the spreading out of our forces throughout SEA, but rather a consolidated effort in Laos where a firm stand can be taken..." A limited interim course of action is provided herewith in the event SEATO Plan 5 is considered politically unacceptable. JCS Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, JCSM 716-61, 9 October 1961................................................................. 297
33.	"For what one man's feel is worth, mine -- based on very close touch with Indo-China in the 1954 war and civil war afterwards until Diem took hold — is that it is really now or never if we are to arrest the gains being made by the Vietcong." Bundy suggests that an early, hard-hitting operation has a 70^ chance of success. "The 30^ is that we would wind up like the French in 1954; white men can't win this kind of fight. On a 70-30 basis, I would, myself, favor going in." Bundy memorandum for Secretary McNamara, 10 October 1961..................................................     322
34.	It is estimated that the Communist Bloc would not commit North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces to a large-scale military atta.ck against South VN or Laos in response • to an assumed SEATO action to patrol the GVN coast

and secure the border involving about 25,000 men. Neutral-ist governments in SEA would be most concerned at the increased tension and danger of general hostilities. Nationalist China would be elated with the SEATO action.
SNIE 10-3-6, 10 October 1961.................................... 313
35.	At a meeting with President Kennedy, the following actions were agreed upon: (1) the Defense Department is authorized to send the Air Force Jungle Jim Squadron to VN; (2) General Maxwell Taylor will leave for SVN on a Presidential mission; and (3) the State Department will pursue specific political actions, i.e., protest to the ICC on North VN support of the VC; table a white Paper at the UN; and con-suit with our SEATO allies regarding support in VN. Gil-patric Memorandum for Record, 11 October 1961........................ 322
36.	"with respect to training the Vietnamese Army for the ’wrong war', it seems clear that in recent months the insurgency in South Vietnam has developed far beyond the capacity of police control. All of the Vietnamese Army successes this past summer have met Viet Cong opposition in organized battalion strength...This change in the situation has not been fully understood by many U.S. officials. In this regard, there is some concern that the Thompson Mission may try to sell the Malayan concept of police control without making a sufficiently careful evaluation of conditions in South Vietnam." JCS Memorandum for General Taylor, CM-390-61, 12 October 1961................................................................. 324
37.	The President requests that General Taylor proceed to Saigon to appraise the situation in South Vietnam and to report his views on the courses of action which the U.S. might take to avoid further deterioration in the situation and eventually to eliminate the threat to the independence of South Vietnam. President Kennedy letter to General Taylor, 13 October 1961.............................................. 327
38.	The President directs the following actions be taken: (1) make preparations for the publication of the white Paper on North Vietnamese aggression; (2) develop plans for presentation of the VN case in the UN; (3) introduce the Jungle Jim Squadron into SVN for the purpose of training Vietnamese forces . He indicates that General Taylor should undertake a mission to Saigon. NSAM 104, 13 October 1961........................ 328	'
39.	It is the conclusion of the DoD General Counselthat the proposed introduction of U.S. combat and logistic forces into VN would constitute violations of Articles 16 and 17 of the

Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in VN of July 20, 1954. Introduction of U.S. troops even for purposes of flood control would still constitute a violation of the Geneva Accords by the Government of VN. If a decision is made to send U.S. troops into VN, the U.S. should justify it on the ground of collective self-defense. "Nothing in the Geneva Accords should be read as abridging the inherent right of Vietnam and the United States to take actions in collective self-defense." DoD General Counsel Memorandum for Mr. Hadyn williams, 26 October 1961..	3^9
40.	General Taylor summarizes the fundamental conclusions of his group and his personal recommendations. Taylor concludes there is a double crisis in confidence: doubt that the U.S. is determined to save SEA, and doubt that . Diem's methods can defeat the Communist purposes and methods. Taylor recommends that the U.S. Government join with the GVN in a massive joint effort as part of a total mobilization of GVN resources to cope with both the VC and the ravages of the flood. Specifically, the U.S. Government will provide individual administrators, conduct a joint survey of conditions in the provinces, assist the GVN in effecting surveillance and control over the coastal waters,	.
and finally, offer to introduce into South VN a military Task Force to operate under U.S. military control. General Taylor telegram (cite BAGIOOOO5) for President Kennedy,
1 November 1961............................................... 331
41.	Taylor presents his reasons for recommending the introduction of a U.S. military force into South Vietnam. "I have reached the conclusion that this is an essential action if
we are to reverse the present downward trend of events... there can be no action so convincing of U.S. seriousness of purpose and hence so reassuring to the people and government of SVN and to our other friends and allies in SEA as the introduction of U.S. forces into SVN." Taylor suggests that the strategic reserve of U.S. forces is seriously weak and that U.S. prestige would be more heavily engaged in SVN by this action. However, the size of the U.S. force introduced need not be great to provide the military pres
ence necessary to produce the desired effect. General
Taylor telegram (cite BAGIOOOO6) for President Kennedy, 1 November 1961.............................................. :	337
42.	The JCS and Secretary McNamara do not believe major units
of U.S. forces should be introduced in SVN unless the U.S.

commitment by military action and preparation for possible later action. They recommend that the U.S commit itself to this objective and support the recommendations of General Taylor toward its fulfillment. Secretary of Defense Memorandum for the President, 8 November 1961......
43.	The head of the British Advisory Mission submits to Diem •	' his plan for clearing the VC from the Delta. The central
idea is the creation of a network of "strategic hamlets" akin to those employed successfully by Thompson in defeating the communist guerillas in Malaya. R.G.K. Thompson letter to Diem, 11 November 1961.....................................
44.	Reversing the November 8 Defense recommendation for a commitment of substantial U.S. ground forces to South Vietnam this November 11 Rusk-McNamara memorandum to the President (perhaps prepared at Kennedy’s specific direction) escalates the rhetoric regarding U.S. interest in a free South Vietnam, but restricts the military recommendation: (a) employ only support forces now; (b) defer any decision to send "larger organized units with actual or potential direct military missions." whether Kennedy fully accepted the highblown statements of U.S. interest and commitment to the GVN is not known. State/Defense Memorandum to the President, 11 November 1961................................................
45.	The Joint Staff submits to the Chairman, JCS, briefs of the military actions contained in the draft National Security Action Memorandum resulting from the Taylor Mission Report. The military actions indexed pertain to the use of significant and/or substantial U.S. forces, provision of increased airlift, provision of additional equipment and U.S. personnel, provision of training and equipment for the Civil Guard and SDC, and finally, overhaul of the GVN military establishment and command structure. In connection with the draft memorandum, the Joint Staff considersit militarily desirable to pre-position forces and equipment and is currently considering augmentation of U.S. Army Forces Pacific, with one infantry division plus appropriate logistic and combat support units.

both governments. On its part, the U.S. would immediately support the GVN with increased airlift, additional equipment, U.S. personnel, expedited training and equipping of the Civil Guard and increased economic aid. The GVN, however, would have to initiate the following actions: (1) begin prompt legislative and administrative action to put the nation on a wartime footing to mobilize its resources;
(2)	give governmental wartime agencies adequate authority to perform their functions effectively; and (3) overhaul the military establishment and command structure to create an effective military organization. "President Kennedy contemplates alt immediate strong affirmative reply to satis-factory letter along indicated lines from President Diem, which will simultaneously be made public." Rusk NIACT 619 to Saigon, 15 November 1961....................................... 400
47.	After three days of talks in Saigon, Ambassador Galbraith feels there is scarcely "the slightest practical chance that the administrative and political reforms being pressed
upon Diem will result in real change." Gailbraith sees a comparatively well equipped army of a quarter million men facing 15 to 18,000 lightly armed men. "...there is no
solution that does not involve a change of government... to say there is no alternative (to Diem) is nonsense." Ambassador Gailbraith Memorandum for the President, 20
November 1961................................................... 40b
48.	"The key and inescapable point then is the ineffectuality (abetted debatably by the unpopularity) of the Diem Govern-ment. This is the strategic factor. Nor can anyone accept the statement of those who have been either too long or too little in Asia that it is the inevitable posture of the Asian mandarin. For one tlling, it isn’t true, but were it so, the only possible conclusion would be that there is no future for mandarins. The communists don’t favor them." Gailbraith feels that it is politically naive to expect that Diem will reform either administratively or politically in any effective way. "However, having started on this hopeless game, we have no alternative but to play it out for a minimum time...since there is no chance of success we must do two things to protect our situation. One is to make clear that our commitment is to results and not to promises...and we can press hardest in the area of Army reform where the needed changes are most specific and most urgent." It follows from Gailbraith's reasoning that the only solution must be to drop Diem, and ' we should not be alarmed by the Army as an alternative.

54.	Diem is apprehensive about giving control authority to
Big Minh as military field commander because of his fear of a coup. While U.S. policy is to support Diem and he has been so informed by the President, we must find a way to reassure him about a coup. "It is the basis for his real reluctance to do what the Americans want him to do and this basic point needs resolving...what realistic assurances
can we give Diem that the action he fears won’t take place?" Lansdale Memorandum for the CJCS, 27 December 1961............... 427

55.	The Chairman of the JCS summarizes the current situation in VN, methods of VC operations, routes of infiltration and supply, relative strengths, and discusses U.S. military units in place or enroute to VN. "The objectives of the Diem Government in SVN include not only survival against the communists, but also improvement of the national econony, enhancement of SVN's position among Southeast Asian nations, creations of an effective armed force, and preservation of a pro-Western orientation, "Policies directed toward the achievement of these objectives suffer from the concentration of power in the hands of the President, Ngo Dinh Diem, and a small clique headed by his extremely influential and powerful brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu." Chairman JCS Talking Paper for Briefing President Kennedy, 9 January 1962....................... 428
56.	The JCS agree that the basic issue of Diem’s apprehension about a coup needs to be resolved. "I don’t believe there is any finite answer to the question you pose as to how to convince Diem he must delegate authority to subordinates he doesn’t fully trust." JCS Memorandum for General Lansdale, CM-491-62, 18 January 1962	  440
57.	The President establishes a Special Group (Counter Insurgency), the functions of which are as follows: (1) to insure proper recognition throughout the U.S. Government that subversive insurgency ("wars of liberation") is a major form of politico-military conflict equal in importance to conventional warfare; (2) to insure that such recognition is reflected in the organization, training, equipment and doctrine of the U.S. armed forces and other U.S. agencies; (3) to continually review the adequacy of U.S. resources to deal with insurgency; and (4) to insure the development of adequate programs aimed at preventing or defeating insurgency.

58.	State Department agrees that an increase in the Vietnamese armed forces to the 200,000 man level should be supported provided the following factors are considered: (1) that U.S. military advisors and the Vietnamese authorities continue to set valid tactical and strategic plans; (2) the rate of increase should consider the ability of the Army to absorb and train the additional men and the manpower resources of SVN; (3) that the armed forces should level off at 200,000 and further efforts should be devoted to

59.	Secretary McNamara forwards a JCS Memorandum to the President with the comment, "I am not prepared to endorse the views of the Chiefs until we have had more experience with our present program in SVN." The JCS Memorandum recommends that if, with Diem’s full cooperation and the effective employment of SVN armed forces, the VC is not brought under control, then a decision should be made' to deploy suitable U.S. military combat forces to SVN sufficient to achieve desired objectives.

61.	The President approves training objectives for personnel who may have a role to play in counter insurgency programs as well as in the entire range of problems involved in the modernization of developing countries. The training objectives include the study of: the historical, background of counter insurgency, departmental tactics and teclmiques to counter subversive insurgency, instruction in counter insurgency program planning, specialized preparations for service in underdeveloped areas. Training of foreign nationals trill also be included in the program. The President desires that current counter insurgency training be examined to ascertain if it meets the above training objectives.

The JCS cite the Kennedy letter of 14 December 1961 to President Diem as a public affirmation of the intention of the U.S. Government to support President Diem to whatever extent necessary to eliminate the VC threat. In sura, it is the JCS opinion that the present U.S. policy toward SVN as announced by the President "be pursued vigorously to a successful conclusion."

progress has been blunted and that the situation is irn-proving.

The VC will continue to wage a war of attrition and there is no threat of overt attack from the North. On the basis of the last year’s progress the VC can be contained but it is impossible "to project the future course of the war with any confidence.

of getting rid of the Nhus (the combined judgment was that it would not be possible), pressure on Diem to take political actions, possible results of a coup, and the replacement of Ambassador Nolting with Ambassador Lodge. Department of State Memorandum of Conversation, 4 July 1963......................................................... 526
73- A Special National Intelligence Estimate evaluates the political crisis in South Vietnam arising from the Buddhist protest. It concludes that if Diem does not seek to conciliate the Buddhists new disorders are likely and there will be better than even chances of coup or assassination attempts. U.S-GVN relations have deteriorated as a func-
tion of Diem's distrust of U.S. motives in the Buddhist affair and he may seek to reduce the U.S. presence in Vietnam. The Communists have thus far not exploited the Buddhist crisis and they would not necessarily profit from a non-Communist ovcrthrow. A successor regime with continued U.S. support would have good chances of effectively pursuing the war. SNIE 53-2-63, "The Situation in South Vietnam," 10 July 1963.............................................. 529
74.	In a subsequently controversial cable, State informs Lodge	.
that if Diem is unwilling or unable to remove Nhu from the government, that the U.S. will have to prepare for alternatives. Lodge is authorized to inform the Vietnamese generals plotting a coup that if Nhu is not removed we will be prepared to discontinue economic and military aid, to accept a change of government and to offer support in any period of interim breakdown of the central government mechanism. State Department Message to Saigon 243, State to Lodge, 24 August 1963......................................................... 536
75.	U.S, policy with respect to a coup is defined in more detail for Lodge and Harkins as a result of an NSC meeting with the •	. President. "The USG will support a coup which has good chance
of succeeding but plans no direct involvement of U.S. armed forces. Harkins should state (to the generals) that he is prepared to establish liaison with the coup planners and to review plans, but will not engage directly in joint coup planning." Lodge is authorized to suspend aid if he thinks it will enhance the chances of a successful coup. State Department Message 272, State to Lodge and Harkins, 29 August 1963......................................................... 538

feels that if accompanied by the threat of a real sanction — i.e., the withdrawal of U.S. support — such an approach could be timed to coincide with the readiness of the generals to make their move and might, therefore, offer some promise of getting Diem to act. State Department Message 279, State to Lodge, 29 August 1963.....................................
77.	Vice President Johnson presides over a meeting at the State Department on the subject of SVN. The generals’ plot having aborted, Rusk asks what in the situation "lead us to think well of a coup." Further, Rusk feels that it is unrealistic now "to start off by saying that Nhu has to go." McNamara approves Rusk's remarks. Hilsman presents four basic factors bearing on the current situation: (1) the restive mood of the South Vietnamese population; (2) the effect on U.S. programs elsewhere in Asia of the current GVN policy against the Buddhists; (3) the personality and policies of Nhu; and (4) U.S. and world opinion. Vice President has great reservations about a coup because he sees no genuine alternative to Diem. General Krulak Memorandum for the Record, 31 August 1963.......................................................
78,	Lodge is instructed by the white House that since there is no longer any prospect of a coup,pressure must be applied to Diem to get him to adopt an extensive list of reforms. In particular Lodge is authorized to hold up any aid program if he thinks such action will give him useful leverage in dealing with Diem. CAP Message 63516, white House to Lodge, 17 September I963...............................................................
79.	The President explains to Lodge his urgent need for the McNamara-Taylor assessment of the situation.	.

the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the VC." while the results from programs developed after Taylor’s Mission in 1961 were heartening, the serious events in the South since May 1963 have prompted the President to ask McNamara to make a fresh, first-hand appraisal of the situation. "In my judgement the question of the progress of the contest in SVN is of the first importance..." President Kennedy Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, 21 September 1963............................................................. 551
82.	Pending McNamara’s visit and the subsequent review of policy, Lodge is given the following interim guidance: "(1) The United States intends to continue its efforts to assist the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the Viet Cong. (2) Recent events have put in question the possibility of success in these efforts unless there can be important improvements in the government of South Vietnam. (3) It is the policy of the United States to bring about such improvement." State Department Message 458, Eyes Only for Lodge from Ball, 22 September 1963......................................... 553
• • /
83.	The Mc’Tamara-Taylor Mission Report concludes that the military campaign has made great progress, and, while the political crisis in Saigon is serious, "there is no solid evidence of the possibility of a successful coup..." The Report recommends against promoting a coup and, although it is not clear that U.S. pressure will move Diem to the moderations and reforms we desire, nevertheless, as the only course of action with any prospect of producing results, the report recommends the application of selective economic sanctions, including a suspension of funds for the commodity import program. The Mission further recommends a shift of military emphasis to the Delta and a consolidation of the Strategic Hamlet Program. In addition, it is recommended that a
.	training program be established for RVNAF such that the built
of U.S. personnel may be withdrawn by the end of 1965. In
• conjunction with this program, the U.S. should announce plans to withdraw 1, 000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963.. 554

86.	Washington reaffirms Lodge’s guidance that he is not to promote a coup. Neither, however, is he to thwart one. He should try to obtain as much information as possible from the plotters about their plans on which to base an American

88.	A Department of State Research Memorandum contends that the statistical indicators on the war in Vietnam reveal "that the military position of the Vietnam Government may have reverted to the point it had reached six months to a year ago."

89.	with the coup plotting now far advanced and the U.S. clearly committed to the generals’ attempt, Lodge seeks to calm washington’s anxieties about the lack of detailed information on the generals’ plans. He is at pains to oppose any thought of thwarting the coup because he thinks the military will create a government with better potential for carrying on the war, and because it would constitute undue meddling in Vietnamese affairs.

92.	After complaining about Lodge’s failure to keep him informed about the coup planning, General Harkins opposes the proposed coup against Diem. He does not see an alternative leadership with Diem’s strength of character, especially not among the generals. The war continues to go well. MACV Message 2028, Harkins to Taylor, 30 October	595
1963.......................................................
93.	General Harkins takes detailed exception to the interpretations of a deteriorating war effort that Lodge has been transmitting throughout October. He offers an optimistic appraisal of the trend of the war and sees the political crisis as having only a marginal effect on troop morale and military effectiveness. MACV Message 2033, Harkins to Taylor, 30 October 19.63......................................... 597
94.	Lodge argues forcefully for the coup. "It is theoretically possible for us to turn over the information which has been given to us in confidence to Diem and this would undoubtedly stop the coup and would make traitors out of us. For practical purposes, therefore, I would say that we have very little influence on what is essentially a Vietnamese affair." In the event the coup fails, he believes we should do what ■	we can to help evacuate the generals’ dependents. Lodge
believes the generals are all taking enormous risks for the sake of their country and their good faith is not to be questioned. "Heartily agree that a miscalculation could jeopardize position in Southeast Asia, we also run tremendous risks by doing nothing." General Harkins did not concur in the cable. CAS Saigon Message 2063, 30 October 1963............................................................ 600

Taking note of the difference of opinion on the advisability of a coup between Lodge and Harkins, the white House specifically informs Lodge that he is to discourage the generals from any attempt that in his judgement has a poor prospect of success. Lodge is given full authority for country team actions in the event of a coup; if he has left for washington, Harkins will have charge. In the event of a coup, U.S. policy will be: (a) to reject appeals for direct intervention from either side; (b) .if thc‘contest is indecisive, U.S. authorities may perform any actions agreed

	The current situation in South Vietnam
The Viet Cong have heavily infiltrated, organized and now ef-	
fectively control the colored areas on this chart.	
To achieve their purposes the Viet Cong have divided the
country into two major geographical areas, Intersector V with headquarters in the high plateau region north and West of Kontum, and the Nambo sector in the south with headquarters northeast of Saigon. Each major area is subdivided into interprovincial commands—four in intersector V and three in Nambo, with a Special zone for Saigon. Each interprovincial area is further organized into provinces which are further subdivided into districts, villages, and hamlets. 
— Methods of VC Operation
The 16,500-man Viet Cong military establishment is divided
into two operational groups --regular and regional local forces.
Regular battalions and companies, numbering about 8,500 personnel
constitute the offensive element of the "Liberation Army" and operate throughout their respective interprovincial zone.

On 1 November 1961 the personnel strength of the military Assistance Advisory Group in Vietnam was 841, present strength is 1204 and projected strength as of 30 June 1962 is 2394. The total personnel strength of US units and elements, other than the MAAG, was 1442 as of 2 January 1962 and projected strength as of 30 June 1962 is 3182.
The total US personnel in South Vietnam is now 2646 and projected strength as of 30 June 1962 is 5576.
The MAAG is extending its advisory teams to battalion level within the RVNAF MA Military establishment and beginning to participate more directly in advising Vietnamese unit commanders in the planning and execution of military operations plans. Since delivery of MAP equipment has been accelerated and RVNAF military operations are increasing, the
■ MAAG training activities have been expanded. This training includes operations, planning, logistics, intelligence, communications and electronics as they apply to each service within the RVNAF. They are also accelerating the training of the Vietnamese Civil Guard and SelfDefense Corps.

Subjcct: Vietnamese Command Problem (C)
1. As .you point out in your memorandum of 27 December 1961, it is quite clear that Diem’s apprchcnsion about a coup is the basis for his rcluctance to authorize his military field commander to implement the task force concept that was an important part of the over-all plan of operations against the Viet Cong. I fully agree that this basic issue needs to be resolved.	•

3. In my view, however, some of the deCisions made during the 16 December SecDef meeting at CINCPAC Headquarters offer a greater hope for progress in Vietnam. It was agreed that, while we should continue to press for acceptance of an over-all plan or concept of operations, we must place immediate emphasis on smaller, more specific, and more readily-accomplished operations. Such a technique is more likely to be acceptable to Diem. At the same time, successful small operations will provide the impetus for larger scale offensive operations.

2. You are well aware that Chief MAAG, Vietnam, in accordance with his assigned mission, has operated principally as an adviser and trainer rather than as a commander. As such he has suggested and counscled, dropping ideas which the Victnamcse could pick up and incorporate in their own plans. This method "saved face" for them, and has been the accepted method of overcoming simultaneously the inexperience and the pride of the Vietnamese officers'. Now a strong case can be made for increased direct participation by US pcrsonncl in the planning and supervision of Vietnamese counterinsurgency operations. Inherent in such increased direCt participation should be some assurance of US support for Diem personally. Convincing Diem of this personal support remains a principal task of the senior US representative in Vietnam. The increased US military stake in Vietnam shouId be of great assistance in this task.

b. To insure that such recognition is reflected in the organization, training, equipment and doctrine of the U.S. Armed Forces and other U.S. agencies abroad and in the
political, economic, intelligence, military aid and informational programs conducted abroad by State, Defense, AID, USIA and CIA. Particular attention will be paid the special training of personnel prior to assignment to MAAG's and to Embassy staffs in countries where counter-insurgency problems exist or may arise.
p. To keep under review the adequacy of U.S. resources to deal with actual or potential situations of insurgency or indirect aggression, making timely recommendation of measures to apply, increase or adjust these resources to meet anticipated requirements.
d. To insure the development of adequate interdepartmental programs aimed at preventing or defeating subversive insurgency and indirect aggression in countries and regions specifically assigned to the Special Group (C. I.) by the President, and to resolve any interdepartmental problems which might impede their implementation.
In performing the above functions, the members of the Special Group (C.I.) will act on behalf of their respective departments and agencies, and will depend for staff support upon their own staffs, and upon such country or regional interdepartmental task forces (normally chaired by a State Department Assistant Secretary) as may be established.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE WASHINGTON
TOP SECRET	January 26, 1962
Dear Mr. Gilpatric:
I have received your letter of December 28 to the Secretary on the question of an increase in the Vietnamese armed forces to the 200,000 man level. The matter was discussed with our Task Force while Ambassador Nolting was here on consultation.
In view of the gravity of the situation in Viet-Nam and of the importance of not interrupting the accelerated rate of our assistance to Viet-Nam, we agree that an increase to about 200,000 should be supported provided the following factors are given careful consideration:
1.	That the U.S. military advisers and the Vietnamese authorities continue the joint effort to build up a set of valid tactical and strategic plans, we suggest that the locus of this effort should be in Viet-Nam in order to obtain full Vietnamese cooperation and to meet the speed requirements of a guerrilla war where a large number of incidents are constantly occurring, we would envisage strategic plans made in Saigon giving priority to areas to be cleared and held and setting forth general methods to be used, we believe these should be accomplished by numerous small tactical actions planned and executed by American and Vietnamese officers on the spot to meet the local situation at the moment.
2.	The rate of increase to approximately 200,000 men should take into consideration:
a.	The ability of the army to absorb and train these men without unduly weakening its fighting ability.
b. Viet-Nam
The Honorable
Roswell '. Gilpatric,
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

b.	Viet-Nam must husband its manpower resources carefully.
A minimum number of. trained civilians must cc left at their posts in order to at least partially satisfy the rising expectations of Viet-Nam*s citizens.
3.	That the armed forces night best level off at about 200,000 with future emphasis to be devoted to strengthening and enlarging the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps. Their job would be to hold ground that had been recovered.	.
4.	That henceforth our training programs for AH' be based primarily on the concept that the Vietnamese army will start winning on the day when it has obtained the confidence of the Viotnar-ese peasants. As a specific example I suggest that we i—e-iat-ly seek Vietnamese implementation of a policy of promptly giving a snail reward in rice, salt or money (commodities in which the Viet Cong are in short supply) to every’ person w?.o gives information to the arn.y. Similarly,villages which show determination to resist the Viet Cong should receive the promptest possible support.
I would be glad to receive any comments you may have with respect to the foregoing.
Sincerely you-

Subject: The Strategic ImportanCe of the Southeast Asia	•
' Mainland (U)	.
• • .
/ 1. The United States has clearly stated and demonstrated that one cf its unalterable objectives is the prevention of South Vietnam	x
falling to communist aggression and the subsequent loss of the remainder cf the Southeast Asian mainland. The military objective, therefore, must be to take expeditiously all actions
a	necessary to defeat COmrnumst afjgress.on m South. Vietnam. The	tg
",	immediate strategic importance of Southeast Asia lies in the	f
politinal vame mat can accrue to tae Free World through a success-	.
ful stand in that area. Cf equal importance is the psychological impact that a firm, position by the United States will have on the	:
countries of the world - both free and communist. On the negative side, a United States political and/or military withdrawal from the	„
Southeast Asian, area would have an adverse psychological impact	• .
.	.	of even greater proportion, and one from which recovery would	V..
be both difficult and Costly.	*	.

f 2. It must be recognized that the fall of South Vietnam to

of all of the Southeast .Asian mainland. There is little doubt that the next major target would oe Thailand. Cadres are now being established in that Country and "land reform" or ’’capitalist

probably Cease to exist. The only determined opposition to a
’ communist drive would then be Malaya and Singapore. While the
•	people of Malaya have the will to fight and might have the backing
of the United Kingdom, the country itself would be isolated and hard pressed. The communist element in Singapore is strong. Short of direct military intervention by.the United States, it is questionable whether Malaya and Si l^apore could be prevented from eventually coming under communist domination or control. .
i 3.' Military Considerations. p(The Appendix Contains a more detailed appraisal of these military considerations. O .
. a. Early Eventv.atiltes - Loss of the Southeast Asian Mainland vzould have an adverse impact on our military strategy-and v/ould markedly reduce our ability, in limited war by denying us air, land and sca bases, by foroing oreater ir_teHiser.ee effort with lesser results, bv compli-eating military lines o. communication and by the introduction cf more formidable enemy loroes in the are?.. Air access and '	.	access to 5300 miles of mainland coastline v/ould be lost to
us, cur Allies and neutral India v/ould be outflanked, the 1?.st significant United Kingdom military strength in Asia would be eliminated with the loss of Singapore and Malaya and US military influence in that area, short of war, would be difficult to exert.	"	_	.
• . . • ' -
b. Pos sib Ie Eventualities - Of equal importanCe to the immediate losses are the eventualities which could follow the
•	loss of the Southeast Asian mainland. All of the Indonesian
archipelago Could come under the domination and Control of the USSR, and would beCorne a Communist ba.se posine a threat • . . ; । against Australia ana Nev,- Zealand. The Sino-Scviet Bloc wov’d have Control of the eastern access to the Indian Ocean. The Philippines and Japan could be pressured to assume at best, a neutralist role, thus eliminating two of our major bases of defense in the Western Pacific. Our Linos cf defense then would be pulled north to Korea, Okinawa and Taiwan resulting in the subsequent overtaxing of our line 5 of communications in a limited war. India’s ability to remain neutral v/ould be

Asia mainland and must extend its infiuence in that area in such a . manner as to negate the possibility of any future communist encroachmant. It is recognized that the military and politic?.! effort of Communist China in South Vietr.am and the political and psychological thrust by the USSR, into the Indonesian archipelago are not brushfire tactiCs nor merely a campaign for control of the mainland area. More important, it is part of a major campaign to extend communist control beyond the periphery of the Sino-Soviet Bloc and overseas to both island and continental areas in the Free World, through a most natural and comparatively soft outlet, t?.e Southeast Asian Peninsula. It is, in fact, a planned phase in the Communist timetable for world domination. Whereas, control of Cuba has opened for the Sinn-Soviet BloC more ready access to Countries of South and Central A.meriCa, control of Southeast Asia will open. aocess to the remainder of Asia and to -Africa and

- £ 5CIn consideration of the formidable threat to the Free 'world .	- which is represented in the current actions in South Vietnam, the
. need for US and GVN success in that area cannot be overemphasized.
' In this connection, reference is made to t'ne staff level document • entitled "Summary.of Suggested Courses of Action” prepared for ' General Taylor for reference in his mission to South Vietnam. On
21 October 1961, this document Circulated comments and reoo.nmen-.	dations on 20 courses of action that could be taken in South Vietnam
snort of the direCt utilization, of US Combat foroes. The Joint Chiefs of Staff note that, in keeping with, the President's decision that we must advise and support South Vietnam but not at this time engage unilaterally in combat, all of the courses cf aCtion recommended with few exceptions stave either been implemented, or authorized ' for implementation. In this conucCtion, it is noted that the

□7, 1— response to President Diem’s request for assistar.Ce and theTgrcement between the governments, men, money, materials and adviCe are being provided to South Vietnam. Unfortunately, our contributions are not being properly employed by the South Vietnamese Government and major portions cf the agreement have either not been carried out or are being delayed by Diem.
8. For a combined US/Vietnam effort to be successful, there
'	-must be combined participation in the decision making process.
To date efforts made on both, the military and diplomatic level have failed to motivate Diem to agree to act forthrightly on our • advice and properly utilize the resources placed at his disposal. He has been slow to accept the plans and proposals of Admiral Felt and General McGarr and he has in many instances disregarded the advioe of Ambassador Nolting. The reason for Diem’s negative reaction to proposals to save South Vietnam while he maintains a
.	positive position that it must be saved may be found in CINCPAC’s
appraisal cf his character - an uncompromising inflexibility and his doubts concerning the judgment, ability and individual loyalty of his military leaders. Recent intelligence reports cf coup d'etat
.	plotting involving senior Vietnamese military officers and the
possibility that high Vietnamese officers have approached US officials tend to confirm Diem's doubts concerning the loyalty of some of his military leaders.
•	9. In this regard, should a successful coup overturn Diem,
• we might discover that many of Diem's difficult CharaCteristics are national rather than personal. The Vietnamese are tough, tenacious, agile, proud, and extraordinarily self Confident. Their recent political tradition is one of the multiplicity of parties and • “ groups inclining toward conspiratorial and violent methods. The -	disappearance of a strong leader who can dampen and control these
tendencies could well mean reversion to a condition of political c?.?.os exploitable by the strongly led and well disciplined communists. If Diem goes, we can be sure of losing his strengths but vze cannot be
1	•	sure of remedying iris weaknesses. Achievement of US objectives
Could be more difficult without Diem than with him. Therefore, it must be made clear to Diem that the United States is prepared and

13. Three salient factors are of the greatest importance if the eventual introduction of US forces is required.
. a. Any war in the Southeast Asian Mainland will be a peninsula and islav.d-type cf campaign - a mode of warfare in which all elements of the Armed Forces of the United States have gained a- wealth of experience and in which we have e:<Celled.
f	. both in World War II and Korea.
b.	Study of t’:e proble-n dearly indicates that the communists are limited in the forces they Can sustain in war in that area because of natural logistic and transportation problems.	-
c.	Our present world military posture is such that v/e now have effective forces capable of implementing existing

’ unacceptable degree our capability to conduct planned operations
• in Europe relating to Berlin or otherwise.
14. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that in any" consideration .of further action which. may be required because of possible unacceptable results obtained despite Diem's full coopers-tion and the effective employment of South Vietnam armed forces, you again consider the recommendation provided you by JCSM-32O-61, dated 10 May 1?61 that a decision be made to deploy suitable US forCes
. to South Vietnam sufficient to accomplish the following:

NATIONAL SECURITY ACTION MEMORANDUM NO. 132
TO:	The Honorable Fowler Hamilton
The Administrator	.
Agency for International Development
(SUBJECT:	Support of Local Police Forces for Internal Security
and Counter-Insurgency Purposes)
As you know, I desire the appropriate agencies of this Government to give utmost attention and emphasis to programe designed to counter Communist indirect aggression, which I regard as a grave threat during the 1960s. I have already written the Secretary of Defense "to move to a new level of increased activity across the board" in the counter-insurgency field.
Police assistance programs, including those under the aegis of your agency, are also a crucial element in our response to this challenge. I understand that there has been some tendency toward de-emphasizing them under the new aid criteria developed by your agency. I recognize that such programs may seem marginal in terms of focusing our energies on those key sectors which will contribute most to sustained economic growth. But I regard them as justified on a different though related basis, i.e., that of contributing to internal security and resisting Communist-supported insurgency.
I am further aware that police programs, as a relatively minor facet of the functions of the aid agency, may have tended to receive little emphasis as a result. Therefore, I would like you to consider various ways and means of giving the police program greater autonomy within AID, if this seems necessary in order to protect it from neglect.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
I fully recognise that police programs must be looked at on a case- . by-case basis and that in some instances they can indeed bo cut back or eliminated. I simply wish to insure that before doing so we have taken fully into account the importance of the counter-insurgency objective as 1 view it.
In surn, I should like AID to review carefully its role in the support of local police forces for intern?.! security'and conntor-insurgency purposes, and to recommend to me through tho Special Group (CounterInsurgency) v/hat new or renewed emphases are desirable.

The Secretary of Defense The Attorney General - The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff The Director of Central Intelligence The Administrator, Agency for International Development The Director, United States Information Agency
SUBJECT:	Training Objectives for Counter-Insurgency
1.	The President has approved the following training objectives for officer grade personnel of the departments and agencies indicated .	above who may have a role to play in counter-insurgency programs as well
as in the entire range of problems involved in the modernization of developing countries.
a.	The Historical Background of Counter-Insurgency
Personnel of all grades will be required to study the history of subversive insurgency movements, past and present, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the problems and characteristics of Communist tactics and techniques as related to this particular aspect of Communist operations. This kind of background historical study will be offered throughout the school systems of the responsible departments and agencies, beginning at the junior level of instruction and carrying forward to the senior level.
b.	Study of Departmental Tactics and Techniques to Counter Subversive Insurgency
Junior and middle grade officers will receive instructions in the tactics and techniques of their particular departments which have an application in combating subversive insurgency. This level of instruction will be found in the schools of the Armed Services at the company/field officer level. In the case of the Central Intelligence Agency, this kind of instruction will be offered at appropriate training installations. The State Department will be responsible for organizing appropriate courses in this instructional area for its own officers and for representatives of the Agency for International Development and the United

States Information Agency. Schools of this category will make available spaces in agreed numbers for the cross-training of other U.S. agencies with a counter-insurgency responsibility.
c.	Instruction in Counter-Insurgency Program Planning
Middle grade and senior officers will be offered special training to prepare them for command, staff, country team and departmental positions involved in the planning and conduct of counter-insurgency programs. At this level the students will be made aware of the possible contributions of all departments, and of the need to combine the departmental assets into effective programs. This type of instruction will be given at the Staff Collegewar College level in the Armed Services. .The State Department will organize such courses as may be necessary at the Foreign Service Institute for officials of State, Agency for International Development and United States Information Agency. All schools of this category will make available spaces in agreed numbers for the cross-training of other U.S. agencies with a counter- insurgency responsibility.
d.	Specialized Preparatlons for Service in Underdeveloped Areas
There is an unfulfilled need to offer instruction on the entire range of problems faced by the United States in dealing with developing countries, including special area counterinsurgency problems, to middle and senior grade officers (both military and civilian) who are about to occupy important posts in underdeveloped countries. A school will accordingly be developed at the national level to meet this need, to teach general (including counter-insurgency) policy and doctrine with respect to underdeveloped areas, to offer studies on problems of the underdeveloped world keyed to areas to which the students are being sent, and to engage in research projects designed to improve the U.S. capability for guiding underdeveloped countries through the modernization barrier and for countering subversive insurgency. In addition, this school would undertake to assist other more specialized U.S. Government institutions engaged in underdeveloped area problems (i.e., those conducted by the Foreign Service Institute, Agency for International Development, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Services, including the Military Assistance Institute and the Central Intelligence Agency) to develop curricula on the nontechnical aspects of their courses of instruction.
e.	Training of Foreign Nationals	.
It is in the interest of the United States to provide counter-insurgency training to selected foreign nationals, both in the United States and in their own countries. The emphasis

(3)	U.S. iilAGs/tissions end USCis in countries with . counter-inmirgcncy rro~raus.
2.	It is desired that the Special Group (Ccunter-Insurgoncy) explora ways cf organising a school of tho typo deecribed in paragraph 1 d above as a natter of urgency and develop appropriate recemsniatiens. The Special Group (Countar-Iiirargency) should also olsmmta the possibility cf setting up i-itarin courses at ths Foraign Servica Institute and/or at tho National Uar Coilego to fill the gap curing consideration of a now school.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

Subject: Viet-Nam .
. The follovring considerations influence our thinking on VietNam:
v—Yr—	’
1.	We have a growing military commitment. This could expand ' step by step into a major, long-drawn out indecisive military involvement. •• •
2.	We are backing a weak and, on the record, ineffectual govern-•	ment and a leader who as a politician may be beyond the point of no
return.
3.	There is consequent danger we shall replace the French as the colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did.
4.	The political effects of some of the measures which pacification requires or is believed to require, including the concentration of population, relocation of villages, and the burning of old villages, may be damaging to those and especially to Westerners associated with it.	/
5.	We fear that at some point in the involvement there will be a major political outburst about the new Korea and the new war into which the Democrats as so often before have precipitated us.
6.	It seems at least possible that the Soviets are not particularly desirous of trouble in this part of the world and that our
•	military reaction with the need to fall back on Chinese protection
may be causing concern in Hanoi.

In the light of the foregoing we urge the following: J
1.	That it be our policy to keep open the door for political solution. We should welcome as a solution any broadly based nonCommunist government that is free from external interference. It should have the requisites for internal law and order. We should not require that it be militarily identified with the United States.
2.	We shall find it useful in achieving this result if we seize any good opjX>rtunity to involve other countries and world opinion in settlement and its guarantee. This is a useful exposure and nressure on the Communist bloc countries and a useful antidote for the argument that this is a private American military adventure.
We should measurably reduce our commitment to the particular present leadership of the government of South Viet-Nam.
To accomplish the foregoing, we recommend the fo11ovri.ng specific steps:
1.	In the next fortnight or so the ICC will present a report which we are confidentially advised will accuse North Viet-Nam of subversion and the Government of Viet-Nam in conjunction with the United States of not notifying the introduction of men and materiel as prescribed by the Geneva accords. We should respond by asking the co-chairmen to initiate steps to re-establish compliance with the Geneva accords. Pending specific recommendations, which might-at some stage include a conference of signatories, we should demand a suspension of Viet Cong activity and agree to a standstill on an introduction of men and materiel.
2.	Additionally, Governor Harriman should be instructed to approach the Russians to express our concern about the increasingly dangerous situation that the Viet Cong is forcing in Southeast Asia-. They should be told of our determination not to let the Viet Cong overthrow the present government while at the same tine to look . without relish on the dangers that this military build-up is causing in the area. The Soviets should be asked to ascertain whether Hanoi' can and will Call off the Viet Cong activity in return for phased' American withdrawal, liberalisation in the trade relations between the two parts of the country and general and non-specific agreement to talk about reunification after some period of tranquillity.
,	3. Alternatively,

3.	Alternatively, the Indians should be asked to make such an approach to Hanoi under the same terms of reference.
4.	It must be recognized that our long-run position cannot involve an unconditional commitment to Diem. Our support is to nonCommunist and progressively democratic government not to individuals. We cannot ourselves replace Diem. But we should be clear in our mind that almost any non-Communist change vrould probably be beneficial and this should be the guiding rule for our diplomatic representation in the area.
In the meantime policy should continue to be guided by the following:

1.	We should resist all steps which commit American troops to combat action and impress upon all concerned the importance of keeping American forces out of actual combat commitment.
/
2.	We should disassociate ourselves from action, however necessary, which seems to be directed at the villagers, such as the new concentration program. If the action is one that is peculiarly identified ' with Americans, such as- defoliation, it should not be undertaken in the absence of most compelling reasons. Americans in their various roles should be as invisible as the situation permits.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject:. US Policy Toward Vietnam (U)
1.	Reference is made to a memorandum by the Assistant Secrctary of Dcfcnse (ISA) datcd 10 April 1962, requesting comments on a mcmo-randum to the President by the Honorable J. K. Galbraith, US Ambassador to India, wherein he proposes changcs to the present US policy toward Vietnam and the government of President Diem.
L
2.	The burden of Mr. Galbraith's proposals appears to be that present US policy toward Vietnam should be revised in order to seek a political solution to the problem of communist penetration in thc area. The effect of these proposals is to put the United States in a position of initiating negotiations with the communists to seek disengagement from what is by now a well-known commitment to take a forthright stand against Com-munism in Southeast Asia.
3.	The President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense both have recently and publicly affirmed the intention of the US Govern-ment to support the government of President Diem and the people of South Vietnam to whatever extent may be necessary to eliminate the Viet Cong threat. In. his letter of 14 December 1961 to President Diern, Presidcnt Ken.,edy said:

/ A S’
"Your (President Diem’s) letter underlines what our own infor-mation has convinCingly shown -- that the campaign of force and terror now being waged against your people and your Government is supported and directed from the outside by the authorities at Hanoi. They have thus violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords designed to ensure peace in Vietnam and to which they bound them-selves in 1954.

"At that timc, thc United States, although not a party to the Accords, declared that it would vicv/ any renewal of the aggression in violation of thc agreements with grave concern and as scriously thrcatcning international peace and security. We continue to maintain that view. ”
"In accordance with that declaration, and in responsc to your request, we arc preparcd to help the Republic of Vietnam to pro-tcct its people and to preserve its independence. "
4.	The various measures approved for implementation by thc Unitcd States in support of our objectives in South Vietnam have not yet been underway long enough to demonstrate their full effcctivcncss. Any reversal of US policy could have disastrous effects, not only upon our relationship with South Vietnam, but with the rest of our Asian and othcr allies as well.
5.	The problems raised by Mr. Galbraith with regard to our present polioy have been considered in the coordinated development of that policy. Thc Joint Chiefs of Staff are aware of the deficiencies of the present government of South Vietnam. Flowcver, the President's policy of sup-V J porting the Diem regime while applying pressure for reform appears to be thc only practicable alternative at this timc. In this rcgard, thc views of thc Joint Chiefs of Staff as expressed in JCSM-33-62 are reaffirmed.
6.	It is thc opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the present US policy toward South Vietnam, as announced by the President, should be pursued vigorously to a successful conclusion.	'

The President has approved the following Record of Actions for the subject meetings:
At the meeting on the situation in Laos held in the Cabinet Room at 4:30 p.m. today, the President requested contingency planning in the event of a breakdown of the cease fire in Laos for action in two major areas:
(a)	the investing and holding by Thai forces with U.S. backup of Sayabouri Province (being that portion of northern Laos to the west of the Mekong River); and
(b)	the holding and recapture of the panhandle of Laos from Thakhek to the southern frontier with Thai, Vietnamese or U.S. forces.
ln connection with the above contingency plans, the President desired an estimate of the military value of the Mekong River in Sayabouri Province as a defensive barrier in relation to the cost of taking and holding it.
The President also asked that the above planning be undertaken unilaterally by the United States without discussion at this time with the Thais or the Lao.

II. PROGRESS: WHERE ARE WE?
A. The importance cf an integrated and systematic military-pol^
economicstrateplc countcrinsiirgency concent and plan has been reconnited;
tho plan is being implemented.
1, Progress
a.Delta Pacification Plan
(1)	President Ngo Dinh Diem approved a systematic counter-
insurgency plan oa March 19, 1962, which contains the bulk of the British Advisory Mission’s (headed by Mr. R.G.K, Thompson) rec cm on det io ns and those security concepts developed by the US. Dia counter insurgency plan is to ba implemented Ln 10 provinces around Saigon Ln tho Mekong River dalta region (tha so-called ^Delta Pacification Plan14). Col. Hoang Van Lac, a former province chief apparently regarded highly by Diem, is re-sponsible for exacuting the plan, operating under the authority of Nguyen Dinh Thuan, Secretary of State for tha Presidency, and Ngo Dinh Nhu, Dion’s brother and principal political adviser.
(2)	nOperation Sunrise* in Binh Duong province just north of
Saigon, favored by. Diem for special tactical purposos, constitutes tha initial effort in a Eystsaatic, province-hy-provinca pacification campaign. "Operation Supriss” is headed by Brig. Gen. Van Thanh Cao, ths administra-tor of the Southeastern Provincial Region. Three strategic hamlets have been constructed in Birth. Duong province as a resvlt .of this operation and, as of mid-May 1962, more than 2,700 persons had been relocated in thane hamlets. (Two additional hamlets are in the planning or early construction stage.) They are well defended and supported by Civic Action! teams living with ths peasantry and assisting them in a variety of ways. Reports tend to be optimistic as to tha ultimate success of these hamlets.
b. Other Pacification Programs
On May 8, l?62, the second systematic operation to pacify a specific area was started In Fhu Yen province in central Vietnam. It is known as "Operation Sea SwalloW3 and is similar to "Operation Sunrise” in mat-hod and objectives.
(1)	More than 80 strategic hamlets are to be constructed
before the end of l?62; a large number are already in tha process of final construction.
(2)	As of May 18, 1962, there ware more than 600 Civic Action
personnel in Phu Yen provinca formed into more than 70 teams; another 11 teams were to be formad within two weeks. As tn ‘'Operation Sunrise”, these teams assist Ln tha construction of strategic hamlets, organize government services, and help the peasants in a variety of ways.

c.	Strategic Villases and Hamlets
(1)	The strategic village-hamlet concept has taken hold within the Vietnamese Government and is now priority national policy.
(2)	President Diem signed a decree on February 3, 1962, '	creating a special RInterrainisterial Committee for Strategic Hamlets”
to coordinate the program on a countrywide basis, Tha committee is . offic.jally chaired by its Secretary General, Secretary of State -for Ulterior Bui Van Luong, but actually operates under Ngo Dinh Nhu.
(3)	Estimates on the number of strategic villages and hamlets vary, As of December 1961, the Vietnamese Dapartmant of Interior reportedly tabulated almost 800 such villages and'himlots .although in February l?62 the US Embassy estimated that possibly thare were only 190-200 such settlements scattered in more than half of Vietnam's 39 provinces, principally north of Saigon. In April 1962, the Secretary of State for Interior informed a US Mission inter-agency grcup, the Province Pacification Committee, that thore were 1,300 strategic hamlets already in place.
(4)	On June 6, 1962, about 900 officials from all provinces completed a special training course on strategic villages and hamlets. Training reportedly emphasized the Civic Action aspects of tha strategic village-hamlet program as well as the responsibilities of the officials Involved.	;;
t	_	,
d.	Civic Action
(1)	The Vietnamese Department of Civic Action was reorganized in January 1962, creating (I) a central Civic Action Service in Saigon by combining related and heretofore separate services within tha Department and (ii) an integrated Civic Action offica in each province and district.
(2)	As of January 1962, a Civic Action chief and deputy-chief reportedly had bean assigned to every province in Vietnam.
(3)	The Civic Action teams working in strategic villages and hamlets, particularly in support of ^Operation Sunrise” and KOper=ticn Saa Swallow,* are excellently oriented and are doing a good job..
(4)	ISOM has established a committee to provide on a priority basis direct US assistance (and to coordinate such assistance) to Civic Action operations through tha relevant Vietnamese Government agencies.
(9)	The Vietnamase Department cf Defense is also organizing its own Civic Action program.
0• Internal Security and Police Services
(1) The importance of tha counterinsurgency role cf the rural internal security services is reflected in tha US Hi3Sion»s recommendation that the Civil Guard be increased to 90,000 by FT 1962 and the Self Dafensa Corps to 80,000 by FY I963.

(2)	As of the end of April 1962, 89 Civil Guard companies or alnoat 12,000 parsonnal and 276 Self Dsfansa Corps platoons or about 10,900 personnel had bean trained. The goal is reportedly to train a total of soma 49,000 Civil Guard and 60,000 Self Defense Corps personnel by tha and of 1962.
(3)	The Vietnamese Government, with thc holp of USGM, has taken steps to extend tha police system to rural areas in view of tho gap creatad by tha paramilitarisation of tha security servicss. AID is soek-ing to hire 20 additional polios advisers for rural areas. (The present ISON advisory police complsmant in Vietnam is just over 20 parsonnal most of whom operate principally in urban areas.) US aid for tha police program for JT 1962 is US$3.9 rcil’Llcn (of 'which US$2.3 million is for ecmmoditi.se), in addition to about US$4 million in unused aid.
(4)	As of tha end of May 1962, almost 2.8 million cf tha estimated 7 million parsons of tha age of 18 yaara or over have been issttad identity cards. As a result cf this effort, ovor 2,000 military dacortws and $2 Vlat Cong agents have been apprehandad and about 4,000 irregularities in the previous identity card program have been uncovered.
f.	Village Radio System
■ (1) As of the end of May 1962, more than 930 USCM-distributed comranication radios had boon installed in villages and other places in the provinces of Gia Dinh, An Xuyan, Bintt Deong, Dinh Throng, Klen Giang, Kien Phong, Tay Ninh, and Phuoc Tuy. Sinoa tho rata of installation is now about SCO radios par month, USOM expects to have more than 1,000 village radios installed by the end of July 195?.. Another 1,003 sets are scheduled to be installed soon tharsaftor, thus equipping more than 2,000 vDiagos with radio communication facilities.	,
(2)	Tha public safety role of village radios was dnmenstrated on March 20, 1962, whan a joint UBCM-VErtr^^ radio Installation team was attacked by Viot Cong guorrillas. The security escort engaged the Viet Cong while tha team proceeded to install the village radio and then n< ifie.d district headquarters and nearby villages. Assistance was despatched and resulted in an ambush of tha Viet Cong as they ware fleeing toward another village which had been alerted.
g.	Utilization cf US Assistance
(1)	Effective utilisation and integration cf US non-military assistance to Vietnam was strengthened by AID action in March 1962 establishing first, sscond, and third priorities on the basis cf tho iraaadiata impact of aid projacta on the counterinsurgency efforts first priority prcjscts ar a thus 9 with impact during tha next 12 months, including, for sxsmplo, Rural Development, Public Safety (especially radio sets), and Health Sarvicsss second priority projects are those with impact during

tho next 1 to 3 yaars, including, for example. Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives and Highway;and Bridge Construction^ and third priority projects are those with long-term economic and social significance,
,	■ (2) The US Mission has established a number of inter-
agency groups, such as the Province Pacification Committee, for the purpose of coordinating and expediting assistance to Vietnamese Government .	projects in rural areas.
(3) In anticipation of future naeds, the US Mission is also taking measures to stockpile commodities (for example, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, barb wire, fence.posts, fertilizer, etc.) which would be re-leased on short notice for immediate despatch to tho countryside.
2.	Critiquo
a.	Although tho bulk of tho British Advisory Mission’s recom-mandat-ions havo been incorporated into tho "Delta Pacification Plan,” the enabling presidential decree omits the Mission's proposals on ’’prompt payment of compensation for damage to property or loss of life,13 on •‘complete coordination of all civil and military action,” on a "clear chain of command,11 and on "direction and coordination of tha information services and psy-war .units."
b.	US and British officials in Vietnam have voiced serious concern over (i) President Diem’s delay in approving the organizational and implementing machinery for tha "Delta" plan and (ii) a possible subordina-tion of the "Daita” plan to the strategic village-hamlet program. It has been very recently reported, however, that President Diem has approved a merger of the "Dalta11 and tha strategic village-hamlet organizational machinery and has agreed to give the 10 provinces specified in tho ^Doltao plan first priority, subject to modification as required by developments in tho security situation,
c.	Although the Victnamaso Governmant is giving the strategic village-hamlet program high priority, thare is reliable evidence that the program suffers seriously from inadequate direction, coordination, and material assistance by ths central government and from misunderstanding among officials at the provincial and local levels. Province chiefs havo tended to draw up unrealistically high quotas (generally in order to pleaso the authorities in Saigon), and the lack of sufficient resources provided by the government at the local level has in.certain instances resulted in poorly constructed and poorly defended settlements and in financial levies on tho peasant. Moreover, the construction of those settlements has not followed any particular pattern or plan based cn priorities. In his reported recent merger of tha ’’Delta » plan and tho strategic villago-hamlet program, however, President Diem has.indicated that priorities would be established.

d.	Although the mission of ths Viatnamasa Department cf Civic Action is being oriented increasingly toward supporting strategic villages and. hamlots, it appears that there is still considerable emphasis on infornaticnal and intelligence activities. This has reduced tha effectiveness of Civic Action operations and has been somewhat detri-mantal to the favorable reputation built up Ln tha past by Civic Action personnel. Die Civic Action DapartmsHt also suffers from Weak, leadership and internal power rivalries.
e.	The principal problems of the Civil Guard and Self, Daf ones Corps pertain to tactical utilisation which is discussed below, under B. However, there is also some question as to whether these services are being trained and equipped adequately and as rapidly as necessary*
f.	Village radios will substantially improve th? defense of tho countryside and the reaction capability cf the Vi.otnam.esc military and security forces. However, no effort has yet been made to improve radio communications at the hamlet level where tha battle with tha Viat Cong is actually joined.
g.	Two of the principal weaknesses in the effective utilisation of US aid are insufficient awareness on the part of central authorities in tha Vietnamese Government of the need to establish project priorities and tha general inability of these authorities to act quickly to despatch aid in support of projects in the country-side, tho distribution cf US aid must be approved in most cases by President Diem personally, frequently resulting in delays and in administrative bottle-necks. Moreover, Diem continues to exhibit considerable sensitivity to attempts by US officials to distribute aid directly to ths countryside without clearance from th? central government. Recently, for example, ths Vietnamese Government turned down a USOM proposal aimed at increasing the impact of US aid at the local level by establishing a special fund for direct financing of provincial projects.

b.	Tactical Utilization of Army and Security Forces
(1)	Tho Vietnamese Army is getting cut and fighting more than over before. During March 20-28, 1962, the armod forces launched moro than 23 operations of at least company sizo throughout the country. During April 12-May 3, 1962, more than H oparations woro launched, each operation involving more than a battalicnj somo of these operations continued beyond May 3.
(2)	Army units are bosoming more conscious of tho necessity of following through dur Dig attacks in order to prevent the Viot Ceng from disengaging.
(3) are being employod 1962, for example, with army units in
Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps units apparently increasingly with army units. During April l2-May 3, Civil Guard and Self Dafanse Corps units were combinad at least 3 oporations. There have also boon reports
of Civil Guard units receiving helicopter support
(4)	Thore aro reports of off active utilization cf artillery bombardmont. In early March 1962, for example, a combined Army ranger, Civil Guard, and Solf Dafcnse Corps fores engaged tho Viot Cong in Kion Hoa province. Artillery was introduced only after tho Viot Ceng attempted to withdraw, harassing thojr escape routes and inflicting substantial casualties.
(9)	Army rang or units aro being deployed in tha highlands area, recognizing tha equal priority of this area with tho Mekong River delta region where)the pacification program has boon initiated. As cf February 1962, there was a total of 18 ranger companies in tho I and II Army Corps Areas.
(6)	It is ostlmtod that some 3,000-9,000 Montagnard tribo men have bean rccruitod 2nd are being trainsd and armed by tiwwGtiMBBeso Army against tha Viot Cong in tha highlands area. In addition, there are
a.	Dpspito the increasing utilization of Civil Guard and Salf Dafonse Corps units jointly with army forces, tho former continue to be employed excessively on indeptmdant offensive missions. Thc principal stumbling block to tha rectification of this problem is the province chief under whoso authority tho security services operate.
b.	Despite tha increasing deployment of ranger units in the highlands area, thcre is no evidence that those units are being used to any appreciable degree for patrolling the VietnaraeceC-LuG frontier.

1.	Progross
a.	Military commandors in tho field are playing a greater role than in tho past in thc actual formulation and execution of operational plans. For example, much of tho planning of "Operation Sunrise” and * "Operation Sea Shallow* has been carried cut by Vietnamosa Army.division commanders and their staff?• n

o.	Thare is ovidanca that tho authority of certain cabinot members has boon increased, notably Secretary of Stats for ths Presidency Thuan and Sscratery of State for Interior Luong.
f.	Tha Viotnamesa Government has also taken various measures to improve morale among rank-and-filo military and security personnel. In January 1962, tho family allowance rates for Army and Civil Guard privates, privates first class, and corporals (as wall as the combat pay rates for Army personnel in these ranks) were increased, and Army conscripts became eligibla to roceiva a private’s pay after completing four months rathor than one year in sarvice.

virtually all major decisions and even many miner enes, to roly largely on his inner circlo cf official and unofficial advisors rather than on his cabinot officers and tho formal channels cf military and civil command in formulating and executing policy, and to interfere perscn^ly in purely and often minor operational matters. Discontent within tho government
•	bureaucracy and tha military establishment with these tactics by Dism and
his lieutenants does not appear to have docroased substantially during tho past year. Tho prospacts that Dien may change his method of operation are "	not favorable.	.	■ _ •
D. Popular identification cf tha Viotnsmeso people With tha struggle against the Viot Cong appears to nave ingroasod somewhat.
1.	Progress
Hl » ua wox.vw*—
a.	President Diem’s frequent travels tc tho ccunttryeids may Hava improved somewhat tho popular image cf ths central government. During July-Dec emb or 1961, for example, Diom mado 18 known trips cuts id a Saigon and visited 19 different provinces (9 in the central and northern provinces and 10 in tho Mekong dolt a provinces).
b.	Thora is evidence that villagers are passing an Increasing amount of information on tho Viot Cong to government officials. Onc striking example is tha Viot Cong attack on an Army past in An Hca in QuAng Ngai province on April 6, 1962, (Tho Viot Cong used about 300 man, well armed with recoilless rifles and machine guns.) As a result cf an carliar warning by villagers of a possible attack, the Army unit was on alert and, when tho attack camo, repulsed tha Viot Cong with serious leases,
c.	It appoars that defections from tha Viot Cong may ba increasing. It has been estimated that only around 4.00 Viot Cong surrendered to goverg-mant forces during all of 1961. Since the first cf 1962. however, US military sources have been reporting statistics on Viot Cong surrenders on a weekly basis, and it is estimated thstt during February lS-AprilD.O, mere
-than 207 Viot Cong surrendared. (These and other statistics cn th® Vi-st Ceng are derived from various official Vietnamese sources and must b. treated with caution since the Vietnam Government is prone to exaggerate them.)	/
d.	ProBidont Diam signed a dec-reo on Daoomber 18, 1961. p-ovid-ing for the establishment of provincial councils, ultimately to bs 'electad by popular ballot but for tho time being to ba appointad by ths central government. (Youth representatives cn village councils have baon elected t since early 1961.)
e.	According to tha chiefs cf Kontum and H^lku.province, seme 3^,000 Montagnards have been resettled from Viet Ccng-infcstcd to relatively secure areas in these two provinces since January 1962 as a result cf coordinated measures by Vietnamese, military and civilian officials. Tn? 3 a measures have been aimed at reducing the, Viet Cong’s access to tribal elemants fcr recruits, labor, lntclligenca, and supplies.

2.	Critigua
a.	Despite favorable developments, there has been no major break-through in improving tha popular imago of ths government, particularly in the countryside. In tho short run, tho success of this effort will dopand largely on tha degreo of physical security provided tha ■peasantry, but in the long run tha koy to success will be tha ability cf tho govmimant to walk tha thin line of meaningful and sustained assistance to tha villagers without -Obvious efforts to direct, regiment, or control them. •
b.	Thera is growing concern among Vietnamese field personnel in Kontur, Pl ci ku, and other provinces that tho Vie tnamese Goverrmsmt is not moving fast enough to provide adequate assistance to the Montagnard resettle-mont program and, as a result, that tha Viot Cong may succeed”in subverting rasettlemant efforts. According to one report almost 70,000 of an estimated lOp.OOO Montagnard refugees have not yet been resettled.

III.	SUl'EiARY ASSESSMENT
A.	It is about three months since tha current phase of a major systematic counter-insurgency effort began in Vietnam, and too short a time to expect •	airy substantial weakening of tho Communist position.’ Moreover, final
victory is likely to take som? years and to be brought about mor® by a steady erosion of Communist strength than by dramatic military successes.
B.	In tho military-security sector, US. materiel, training, and advice, supplemented by tactical support by US units, have produced sn improvement in armed operations against the Viot Cong. US military operational reports ro.fl.oct improved tactics, shortenod reaction times, and more offactive uso of communications and intelligence. It is too early to say that tho Viet Cong guerrilla-terrorist onslaught is being checked, but it can bo said that it is now mooting more effective resistance and having to copo with increased aggressiveness by tho Viotnsmoso military and security forces. Nonetheless, the Viet: Cong continue to increase thoir armed strength and capability and, on balance, to erode government authority in tho countryside.
C.	Thora has not boon a ccrttssponding improvement in other sectors of the total counterinsurgency effort. Serious problems remain In tho civil and military command structures and in tho exercise of conmand responsibility. Dion continues to prefor personalized rule through a very small group of trusted official and unofficial advisors and traditional methods in matters affecting domestic political opposition. Civil goVernment effectivo-ness is also impeded by shortages in oxpericncod parsonnol, particularly at lower levels, and aggravated by confusion and suspicion at most levels of tho bureaucracy. Moro effoctivo direction and coordination and realistic implementation arc nooded, for example, for such crucially irmortant programs as the HD3ltan plan, strategic villages and hamlets, and Civic Actim. and greater.authority must bo dologated to upper echelon civil and military officials in ordor to make batter usa cf Viotnamesa Government resources.
• Similarly, while there are encouraging signs cf popular support for 4ho go Vermont, thero has boon no major break-through in identifying the people with tho atrugglo against the Viet Cong.	t
D.	Na conclude thats
1.	there is no evidence to support certain allegations of substantial deterioration in tha political and military situations in Vietnams
2.	on tha contrary, thero is evidence of heartening progress in bolstering tho fighting effectiveness cf tho military and security forces’

3.	however., there is still much to bo done in strengthening tha overall capacity of the Vietnamese Government to pursue its total counter-insurgency effort, not only in tha military-security sector but particularly in the political-administrative sector;
4.	a judgment on ultimata success in the campaign against tho Communist "war of national liberation” in Vietnam is premature; but
5.	we do think that tho chances aro good, provided thoro is continu-ing progress by the Vietnamosa Government along tha lines of its present
strategy.

4.	Deployment of Counterinsurgency Personnel
In order to insure a timely deployment of qualified counterinsurgency specialists to impending crisis areas, CIA and AID will take action to insure that adequate qualified personnel with paramilitary skills are available. PeriodiC reports of progress to achieve this objective will be submitted, to the Special Group (Counterinsurgency) by CLA
. and AID.
5.	Support di Covert Paramilitary Operations
More Special Forces personnel will be assigned to support CIA-covert paramilitary operations where acute insurgency situations
■ exist. The Department of Defense has taken steps to expedite these assignments. In addition the Department of Defense will increase its capability to fund, support, and conduct wholly or partly covert paramilitary operations under the criteria of NSAM 57 which distinguishes responsibilities of the Department of Defense and CIA:	,	•	-
Where such an operation is to be wholly covert or disavcwable, it may be assigned to CIA, provided that it is within the normal capabilities of the agency. Any large paramilitary operaticr. wholly or partly covert which requires significant numbers of militarily trained personnel, amounts of military- — equipment which exceed normal CIA-controlled stocks and/or military experience of a kind and level peculiar to the Armed Se: /;ce: is properly the primary responsibility of the Department of Defense with the CIA in a supporting role.
This Cooperation will be intensified and the President will be given periodic reports on the progress of these efforts.
6.	Increased Use of Third Country Personnel .
• The Department of Defense, in Collaboration with the Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency, will undertake a study to determine on a selective basis the feasibility of the concept of the increased use of third-country personnel in paramilitary operations. Particular attention will be given to the following:

(a)	The whole range of this concept front the Current limited use of Thai and Filipinc technicians in Laos to the creation of simply equipped regional foroes for use in remote jungle, hill and desert country. Such foroes v/ould be composed of foreign volunteers supported and controlled by the U.S.	'	_
(b)	The feasibility of using third-country military or paramilitary forces to operate rider their own or other national auspices in crisis areas.
7.	Exploitation of Minorities
In view of the success which has resulted from CI.A/US Army Special Forces efforts with tribal groups in Southeast -Asia, continuing efforts will be made to determine the most feasible method of achieving similar results in other critical areas. On a seleCtive basis, CIA and the Department of Defense will make studies of specific groups where there is reason to believe there exists an exploitable minority paramilitary capability.
8.	Improvement of Indigenous Intelligence Organizations
Recent experience shows that most underdeveloped countries need more efficient intelligence coordination and dissemination systems to counter subversive insurgency. Therefore, the CIA wil"expand its present training and support efforts to achieve needed improvements in indigenous intelligence organisations and that other U.S. agencies contribute to this CIA coordinated program.
9.	Research and Development for Cou.nerinsurgency .	•	a.
The Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence -Agency will carry in their researCh and development programs a spedal section devoted to the requirements of counterinsurgency.

RFE-59, December 3, 1962
SUBJECT: The Situation and Short-Term Prospects in South Vietnam*
This appraisal covers the Communist insurgency and the internal political situation in South Vietnam during the past year and focusses particularly on the direction and effectiveness of the Vietnamese-US counterinsurgency effort. It was prepared as u contribution to the forthcoming NIE 53-62, Prospects in South Vietnam.
ABSTRACT
President Ngo Dinh Diem and other leading Vietnamese as well as many US officials in South.Vietnam apparently believe that the tide is now turning in the struggle against Vietnamese Communist (Viet Cong) insurgency and subversion. This degree of optimism is premature. At best, it appears that the rate of deterioration has decelerated with improvement, principally in the security sector, reflecting substantially increased US assistance and GVN implemcntation of a broad counterinsurgency program.
The GVN has given priority to implementing a basic strategic concept featuring the strategic hamlet and syd-ternatic pacification program:;. It has paid more attention to poetical, economic, and social counterinsurgency measures and their coordination with purely military measures. Vietnamese military and security forces -- now enlarged and of higher quality -- are significantly more offensive-minded and their counterguerrillu tactical capabilities are greatly improved.
.	Effective GVN control of the countryside has.rbeen extended
slightly. In some areas where security has Improved peasant attitudes toward the government appear also to have improved.
*This report is based on information available through November 12, 1962.

As a result, the Viet Cong has had to modify its tactics and perhaps set back its timetable. But the "national liberation war” has not abated nor has the Viet Cong been weakened. On the contrary, the Viet Cong has expanded the size and enhanced the capability and organization of its guerrilla force -- now estimated at about 23,000 in elite fighting personnel, plus some 100,000 irregulars and sympathizers. It still controls about 20 percent of the • villages and about 9 percent of the rural population, and has varying degrees of influence among an additionil 47 percent of the villages. Viet Cong control and communication lines to the peasant have not been seriously weakened and the guerrillas have thus been able to maintain good intelligence and a high degree rf initiative, mobility, and striking power. Viet Cong‘influence has almost certainly Improved in urban areas not only through subversion and terrorism but also because of its propaganda appeal to the increasingly frustrated non-Communist anti-Diem elements.
The internal political situation is considerably more difficult to assess. Diem has strengthened his control of the bureaucracy and the military establishment. He has delegated a little more authority than in the past, and has become increasingly aware of the importance of the peasantry to the counterinsurgency effort. Nevertheless, although there are fewer reports of discontent with Diem's leadership within official circles and the civilian elite, there are still many indications of continuing serious concern, particularly with Diem’s direction of the counterinsurgency effort. There are also reports that important military and civil officials continue to participate in coup plots. Oppositionists, critics, and dissenters outside the government aopear to be increasingly susceptible to neutralist, pro-Communist, and possibly anti-US sentiments. They are apparently placing increased reliance on clandestine activitics.
The Viet Cong is obviously prepared for a long struggle and can be expected to maintain the present pace and diversity of its insurgent-subversive effort. During the next month or so, it may step up its military effort in reaction to the growing GVN-US response. Hanoi can also be expected to increase its efforts to legitimatize its "National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam" (NFLSV) and to prepare further groundwork for a "liberation government" in South Vietnam. On present evidence, the Communists are not actively moving toward neutralization of South Vietnam in the Laos pattern, although they could seek to do so later. Elimination, even significant reduction, of the Communist insurgency will almost certainly require several years.

In either case, a considerably greater effort by the GVN, as well as continuing US assistance, is crucial. If there, is continuing improvement in security conditions, Diem should
be able to alleviate concern and boost morale within the bureaucracy and the military establishment. But the GVN will
not be able to consolidate its military successes into permanent political gains and to evoke the positive support of the peasantry unless it gives more emphasis to non-military aspects of the counterinsurgency program, integrates the strategic hamlet program with an expanded systematic pacification program, and appreciably modifies military tactics (particularly those relating to large-unit actions and tactical use of airpower and artillery). Failure to do so might increase militant opposition among the peasants and thcir positive identification with the Viet Cong.
A coup could occur at any time, but would be more likely if the fight against the Communists goes badly, if the Viet Cong launches a series of successful and dramatic military operations, or if Vietnamese army casualties increase appreciably over a protracted period. The coup most likely to succeed would be one with non-Communist leadership and support, involving middle and top echelon military and civilian officials. For a time at least, the serious disruption of government leadership resulting from a coup would probably halt and possibly reverse the momentum of the government's counterinsurgency effort. The role of the US can be extremely important in restoring this momentum and in averting widespread fighting and a serious internal power struggle.	:

I. THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNIST THREAT TO SOUTH VIETNAM
The Communist threat to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) consists cf three interrelated elements. Within South Vietnam, but under . the direction cf tha Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV), an expanding campaign of guerrilla warfare and terrorism and an intensive political psychological subversion effort are carried cut by an apparatus commonly known as the Viet Ceng,* left behind by the ISV after it withdrew most of its military farces to the north in 1994 and.since reinforced by local recruitment and infiltration from tho DRV. Externally, the IRV holds over South Vietnam the tacit threat of invasion by tho numerically superior North Vietnamase military forces.
In part because ths Government of tho Republic of Vietnam (GVN) focussed its defense efforts too much upon the Implicit external threat and too little upon the internal threat, not only was it unable to counter effectively tho developing Communist movement but also its authority and internal stability in the period from lata 19^9 until early 1962 ere increasingly waakened by Viet Cong insurgent and subversive activities. Since the early part of 1962 however, the rate of deterioration appears to have decelerated as a result of substantially increased US assistance to South Vietnam and expanding GVN implementation cf its broad military-political counter insurgency program. The apparent improvement is principally in the security sector, but with some resultant effects on tho political situation. Many US advisers in South Vietnam, as woll as President Ngo Dinh Diem and other-top GVN officials, aro more optimistic and believe that the deteriorating trends in effect have been checked and that the tide is new being turned in favor of tha GVN. Whether this optimism is justified may wall be deter-mined by developments during the next few months.

For all practical purposes, the Viet Cong apparatus is an extension of the North Vietnamese Communist Party, (Dang lac ltn.e Viat Nam or merely Lao Ibng) which also operates in Laos, Cambodia, and other countries witlTTmportant Vietnamese minority groups.

A.	Strategy and Objectives
In South Vietnam, the Communists are clearly embarked on a "national liberation war" of insurgency and subversion from within rather on overt aggression. It is probably the Communist view that this strategy greatly reduces the risk of direct US military intervention and, at the same time, provides good prospects of success at relatively little cost. In addition, it permits the Communist Bloc to claim continued adherence to the 1954 Geneva Agreements. This strategy was most recently reaffirmed by the Third National Congress of the North Vietnamese Communist Party in Hanoi in September 1960 and the Moscow conference of all Communist parties held the following November and December.
The immediate Communist objectives are to demoralize the South Vietnamese public and the military and security forces, weaken and eventually supplant government authority in the countryside, and discredit and ultimately precipitate the overthrow of President Diem's government. Simultaneously, the Communists are attempting to gain broad popular support for their effort, including the creation of a "united front" with non-Communist elements, and gradually to strengthen and transform their guerrilla forces into regular forces capable of undertaking a general offensive.
The DRV is the implementing agency for Communist activity in South Vietnam. It exercises close control over the Viet Cong guerrillas and over the"Nationa! Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam" (NFLSV), the political instrument of the Viet Cong. However, while Hanoi is probably allowed considerable freedom of action, Moscow and Peiping probably would have overriding influence over any major decision critically affecting the situation in South Vietnam, as for example, international negotiations on South Vietnam, cessation of Communist guerrilla operations, and escalation .	to conventional warfare or overt introduction of North Vietnamese army units.
In any event, important Communist policies for South Vietnam are probably coordinated with Moscow and Peiping and the latter scrutinize developments in South Vietnam carefully with an eye to their own interests. Both Moscow and Peiping also furnish strong propaganda support for the Communist effort in South Vietnam and, in addition, the USSR carries on supporting diplomacy, largely in its capacity as a Geneva Conference Co-chairman. There is little evidence of material support of the Viet Cong guerrillas by Moscow or Peiping.
There are no apparent major policy differences between Hanoi, Moscow, and Peiping regarding South Vietnam. During the first six months of 1962, it appeared that Moscow differed somewhat with Peiping’s and Hanoi’s propaganda for an international conference to settle the South Vietnam situation; t _s difference presumably continues to-exist although little has been said by the Bloc on a conference since mid-1962. There also may be underlying intra-Bloc differences on the subject of neutralization of South Vietnam or reunification. In any event, even though Moscow might prefer neutralization, all would work to corcmunize a neutral South Vietnam if one were established. Moscow has also generally exerted a restraining influence over Communist willingness to take risks.	•

The sharp increase of the US military presence in South Vietnam and the events cf recent months in Laos apparently have not weakened Communist resolve to take over South Vietnam. However, those events have clearly caused some modification of Viet Cong guerrilla tactics and may have caused tho Communists to revise their timetable. Nevertheless, tho Communists probably continue to look primarily to tha long run in South Vietnam and to remain confident of eventual, victory.
B.	Viet Cong Organization and Capabilities
l» General. Available intelligence indicates that two parallel structures, military and political, exist at all organizational levels o. the Viot Cong apparatus in South Vietnam. At the top of tho organization aro two bodies,* tho Mambo Regional Committaa (1OC) and tha Interzone V Regional Committee (IVRC), equal in status and each apparently responsible directly to- Hanoi. Tho NRC directs and is responsible for all operations in tho southorn provinces, or roughly tho former Cochinchina region, while the IVRC directs and is responsible for all operations in tha central and northorn provinces. These committees consist of several staffs responsible for military and political activities. The organization of tho two regional committees appoars to bo duplicated among intermediate and lower levol committees responsible for operations at tho interprovincial (i.e., area covering more than ono province), provincial., district, and village levels. Information is not available on the size of the political component of tho
■ Viet Cong apparatus, but it must be assumed that the regular and irregular guerrilla forces also servo as penotration, espionage, sabotage, propaganda, and terrorist agents.
Viet Cong capabilities have increased considorably during the past three years. In 1999 a relatively small but effective military-political apparatus operating largely in the Mekong River delta provinces, the Viet Cong has since grown into a formidable force operating throughout the countryside and even in mary urban centers, including Saigon, the capital. In addition to increasing its numerical strength, the Viet Cong has significantly improved its military and political organization and its tactical, weapons, and subversive capabilities,
* t	*
2. Military Strength and Effectiveness, Communist assets for guerrilla action in South Vietnam are considerable. In spite of an apparently increasing casualty rate, Viet Cong hard-core personnel has grown from an estimated 4,000 in April 1960 to about 23,000 in October 1962. These forces are distributed principally in tho southern provinces, the formar Cochinchina region which includes the Mokong River delta area and where most of the fighting occurs. They aro well-trained and well-armed (utilizing such	'
weapons as light machine-guns and mortars and even 97 mm.recoilless rifles). Tho units into which these forces are organicod range up to battalion and * include the key personnel infiltrated from forth Vietnam. These units in

effect constitute the elite fighting elements of tho Viet Cong force and operate at the interprovincial, provincial, and district levels. There has been no hard evidence that tho Viet Cong has yet formed regimental-size units or that they have an anti-aircraft capability, other than tha small arms which they are using with increasing effectiveness against helicopters.
In addition to this elite force, the Viet Cong has an auxiliary armed force roughly estimated at 100,000 and distributed throughout the country. This force oporatas essentially at tho village and hamlet levels and consists largely of part-time or full-time armed cadres and sympathizers. Its functions are probably varied, but there is considerable evidence that it serves as a local defense force, provides logistic support (food and intelligence, for example), and constitutes tha reserve from which personnel are drawn as replacements for tha elite force or to help activate new units. The auxiliaries appear to be partially trained and partially armed, fre-quontly utilizing nothing mere than spears, scimitars, and a variety of small weapons manufactured in home workshops or "arms factories." Houever, these limited capabilities apparently are partly offset by tho ability of tiie auxiliaries, many of whom cannot easily be identified by tho GVN, to pass themsolves off as innocent peasants.
By relying on small-unit actions and tactics of surprise» constant movement, concentration for attack, and dispersal upon withdrawal, tho Viet Cong guerrillas have ac-hievod considerable effectiveness. They ambush, carry out company-size attacks against army and security units, and have the capability to strike in battalion force against several targets simultaneously. According to official GVN statistics, the Viet Cong since 1960 has killed more than 9,900 and wounded at least 13,300 military and security personnel. In addition, the GVN estimates that- at least 8,7OOulocal officials and civilians have been assassinated or kidnapped since 1960.*
The Viet Cong appears to bo well-informed particularly on tha plans and movements of government forces sent on largo countorguarrilla operations. Morale is probably also good and desertions or defections to the GVN forces, although reportedly increasing, are relatively few. In recent months, however, shortages of food and the increased aggressiveness of GVN forces
*The statistics oiTViet Cong and~GVN casualties' ar!TT.nc6mi^^ not entirely reliable partly because -he GVN probably understates its 01m casualties and overstates those of the Viet Ceng. Since the latter part of 1961, casualty estimates have improved largely because of tha Increased US presence in South Vietnam, Despite reservations regarding their accuracy, those figures are helpful as one indicator of tha magnitude of tha fighting in South Viatnam.

are believed to have adversely effected the morula and capability of soma Viot Cong forces in the central provinces.
3.	VLet Cong Logistic Support
a. LocaI__Support. The Viet Cong relics principally on local resources to sustain"’its'operations. Both tho character of this support and thc means by' which it is acquired vary conol.derably, It is obtained voluntarily, by' propaganda and promises of mater ial or political benefit, by threats and intimidation, and finally by outright force. It includes, among other things, personnel, arms, food, fund/;, and intelligence.
Most of ths Viet Cong guerrillas and agoiits are recruited locally, with a large percentage coming from the youth. Host of their weapons arc either captured or stolon from GVN military and security forces, are manu-factured in home workshops or Barm factories" in Viot Cong concentration areas, or are activated from stocks cached sincu tho end of tha Indochina war. A considerable portion of Viot Cong funds apparently comes from fees levied on buses and other means of transportation, from taxes on the wealthy and on business enterprises (such as rubber plantations), and from ransoms paid for persons kidnapped. The Viet Cong is entirely dependent upon tha local populaco and the countryside for food which is obtained through purchase, pilferage, capture of stocks, taxation (in the form of rice), and oven actual cultivation of crops by Sympathizers and part-time guerrillas. Finally, tho ability of Viet Cong guerrillas and agents to disperse, regroup, and indeed retain their presence intact, even after GVN military clearing operations have been completed, is considerably-enhanced by the concealment afforded them, voluntarily or otherwise, by tha local population.
In addition, the Viet Cong guerrillas and subversive agents roly heavily on tha villagers for information and supplement?: n of intelligence gained from espionage and from penetration of G\’N military and civilian services. , Intelligence supplied^by tha villager^ is largely of a tactical nature and deals, for example, with the location and movement of local 1VN military and security forces and the defenses of individual army and security posts, villages, and hamlets.

two reliable reports confirming the infiltration of two Viet Cong groups (200 and fOO man respectively) from southern Laos. There is considerable evidence that infiltrators in general are largely South Vietnamese (Cochin-chinose and Annamites), regrouped and retrained in North Vietnam since thc end of tho Indochina war and familiar with the people and terrain of South Vietnam. Thcy carry in their own weapons and, in some instances, a limited amount of additional small and even large weapons, technical equipment, medical supplies, and funds. The infiltrators apparently are distributed among existing Viet Cong units, thus increasing the number of hard-coro personnel and thereby the capability of these units, or become the nuclei of new units. -	.
Since the latter part of 1960, the principal infiltration routes have been through the corridor of southern Laos controlled by Laotian and Worth Vietnamese Communist forces. However, infiltration continues through eastern Cambodia, across the Damilitarized Zona at the 17th parallel, and by junk landings along South Vietnam's long coastline. In addition, Viot Cong guerrillas are balioved to use tho border areas of both southern Laos and eastern Cambodia to a limitod extent for safe haven purposes during their hit-and-run attacks or when pursued by GVN forces.

a. The Communist Position in thc Countryside. There have long been major gaps in cur knowledge of rural conditions in South Vietnam. In view of tha overriding importance that the Viet Ceng attaches to the countryside Ln its strategy, these gaps havo now assumed critical proportions. Although our knowledge of rural conditions i.s improving, principally because of the substantially increasod US presence in South Vietnam, any assessment of Communist political strength outside urban areas remains■ questionable and at bast tentative.
Tho Viet Cong appears to have had considerable success in reducing or supplanting government authority in the countryside. Ry the lattor part of 1961, US officials estimated that probably more than one half of the entire rural region south and southwest of Saigon, as well as several areas just to the north and in tha central and northarn provinces, ware tinder effective Viet Cong control by night, with tho government generally capable os maintaining its authority only by day. Many othar areas were under vary-lng degrees of Viet Cong influence.
According to a more recent and apparently more refined study, US officials estimated in mid-l$>62 that of South Vietnam’s seme 2,900 vill agog which .contain around 85 percent of the total population, 20 percent ware * effectively controlled by tho Viet Cong. Although tha Viet Cong-controlled villages were inhabited by an estimated 9 percent of the rural population,

tha total area represented by these villages encompassed a much larger proportion of tha countryside. In contrast, tho GVN effectively controlled about 4? percent of ths village population, and 33 percent of the villages, largely located, howover, in the environs of major tows and provincial capitals and in the more heavily populated areas along min lines cf cCtmunication. Tn the remaining 4? percent of tha Villages and LU percent ths village population, neither the GVN nor tho Vlst Cong exGucised effective control., even though GVN influence seamed greater in most of these villages'*
The accelerated GVN counter insurgency effort, principally the strategic 'hamlet program and the increasing aggressiveness of tha military and security forces, reportedly has enlarged somewhat the numbar of villages and peasants under effective GVN control.	thU improve-
meat has preswnably occurred principally In areas formerly contested by thq GVN and the Viet Cong since the rural area and pcptlaes estimated as under effective Viet Ceng control has been reduced by only 1? villages With a population cf 15(0,000.
Partly by ths sheer strength of its presence and partly because of tha jg'olonged absence ©f strong ^overment military and	forces,
the Viet Ceng has been able to transform some rural arsas —- 'such as portions of ilia Ca Mau peninsula, the swampy Haina dos dtias highlands in ths north •»- into major conoanbratfcn or ba~e areas which arq dangerously close to boccmi.no ’•'libsratsd3 areas. Here, the Viet Ceng has virtually a free hand in levying and collecting, taxes, directing the cultivation of rice and other farm products, and controlling their dUtri-bution, propagandising the populace, conscripting cadres, and even setting up overt political organizations and provisional local government units.
Tha political capability and strength of the Viet Cong in the countryside is inextricably associated with and strongly dependent upon its military presence and power. Tho threat or tha use of force, as" dsmcn-stratsd by the high rate cf assassinations and kidnappings cf local officials and oven ordinary peasants, is a continual reminder "of the penalty of nenccoporation with tha local Viet Cong. Moreover, by success” ful military operations against the GVN, the Viet Cong is able to demonstrate its superiority and its determination and exility to remain.

local conditions, they have, for example, purchased rather than seized rice and food stuffs in many cases, have taxed the wealthy with effective publicity and reportedly even distributed land to landless peasants. Even thair terrorist acts from time to timc have been against harsh, disliked, or corrupt officials. These acts &xe held out as proof of the Viot Cong’s ability to improve tha psasant’s economic and political lot. Their appeal is enhanced by Ute peasants basic distrust of government officials engendered partly by their excessive and harsh implementation of government programs and by the average Vietnamese burarucrat€s belief that he does not servo but is to bo served by ths paopl®.
Viet Cong propaganda to the peasant, therefore, is both positive and negative. It extols Viot Cong achievements andpcwars credits the Communist forces under Ho chi Minh with expelling the French frem Vietnam and isoping the north froo of foreign control,« holds cut ccoacaie and political inducements, derldostGVN capabillties, and points to tho excessive, oppressive, and corrupt character of GVN daraands and practices, as for example, military conscription and forced labor in tha creation cf strategic hanlots. Viot Coag propaganda also exploits the Vietnamese peasant*s credulity and animistic beliefs, spreading bisarre stories Intondod to limit popular participation in govemmaat programs.

As reflected by Radio Hanoi which also relays NFLSV statements, • the paramount Viet Cong propaganda theme is the dictatorial family rule imposed by the Diem government and its subservience to US "foreign imperialist intervention" which are combining to "oppress" and "murder" the South Vietnamese people and block reunification. This Viet Cong propaganda campaign,coupled with recent political developments in Laos (which some Communist propaganda has implied provides an acceptable model for "settlement" of the South Vietnamese conflict) and with Diem's
• persistent reluctance to tolerate any appreciable non-Communist opposition, has already contributed to an increase in neutralist sentiment among urban circles. Moreover, some oppositionists, including a few leaders of the once-powerful Cap Dai and Hoa Hao religious sects, are reportedly cooperating with the Vict Cong to the point of being committed to participating in an eventual Communist-led anti-Diem coup attempt.
■	Vict Cong capabilities for leading a successful coup are limited,
however. Its own forces, even if combined with any remnant armed bands	.
of thc- Cao Dai and lion Hao religious sects, do not appear strong enough to overthrow the government by military means. Nor is there any evidence that the Viet Cong has any support in the. middle or top levels of the GVN bureaucracy or its military and security establishments. Although the Viet Cong might well be able to exploit the confusion and instability resulting from Diem's overthrow, it does not yet have the ties with the non-Communist opposition to Diem that would enable it to lead a successful coup.
There is no reliable evidence of Viet Cong penetration of the middle or top echelons of the GVN bureaucracy and defense Establishment, • There is believed to be penetration of the lower echelons, and it is clear that the GVN security and intelligence services do not now have the . capability to prevent such penetration. A GVN police interrogation report in early 1962 revealed that there was a large Viet Cong subversive network in the Saigon post office and that an employee of the post office was possibly using the telegraphic system for clandestine communication with North Vietnam.
The Viet Cong has also progressively improved its terrorist capability in Saigon and other urban centers. There have been increasing reports that the Viet Cong has enlarged its terrorist corps in Salgen and that the principal targets of these attacks are to be Americans. Evidence of this capability is the increasing number of grenade bombings in Saigon. For ' example, there were three bombing incidents against Americans in May 1962 and three bombing incidents in connection with Independence Day celebrations • on October 2o, 1962.

THE VIETNAM GOTERNTENP’S COUNTERINSURGENCY EFFORT
A.	Backgrounds Gradual. Response
Tn contrast to the rapid acceleration of the Communist Insurgent and subversive effort, tha GVN response until this year was gradual and relatively uncoordlnatad and generally did not reflect tha sense of urgency acknowledged by Vietnamese officials thomsolvos. It was rot until the early part of l?6l that a comprehensive counterinsurgency plan was drawn up, with the help of US officials, and several months elapsed before genaraT imulementation bogan. Moreover, tha GVN leadership continued to view the situation as onc created and supported largely by external forces with littlo popular appeal and saw their problem as essentially a military one requiring overriding emphasis on purely military measures.
' Even these military measures, howsver, ware weakened principally by the GARI leadership’s reluctance .to Dabandon static defense concepts and permit more offensive actions, for which it had sufficient forces a reluctance that reflected both fear of overt IRV aggression and internal political considerations. In addition, the GVN military and security forces themselves, despite their experience in combatting guerrillas during the Indochina war and thereafter, Were inadequately trained, equipped, and organized to wago a sustained and large-scale ccunterguorrilla effort.
The turning par tod in the GVN response occurred in lata 1961 and early 1962 and resulted largely from substantially Increased US aid, repeated US reaffirmations of political support for President Diem, and persistent US recormendstions, including those develcpad by special US missions to South Vietnam. Accordingly the GVN has diversified its responsa by giving increasing emphasis to political counterinsurgency measures. It has improved tha coordination of these naasurcs with purely military operations, given priority to implementing a basic strategic concept for eliminating tha insurgents, significantly increased tha counter-guerrilla tactical capability of its military and security services, art departed appreciably from static defense concepts, thereby greatly aid: eg the development of increasingly offensive-minded and aggressive military and security forces. By tha early part of 1962, tha GVN had begun to act upon the recognition that the crisis situation in South Vietnam was an internal and political problem, requiring largely political measures to eliminate Communist appeal, support, and control among the peasants.
B.	Formulation and Implementation of Basic Strategic Concept
As a result of persistent US recommendations, the GVN has developed a basic strategic concept for the implementation of its diverse ccmhterN insurgency measures. The two principal features of this concept are' the strategic hamlet program and a closely integrated and coordinated military-political approach directed coward isolating the.Vict Cong and regaining control of the countryside on a systematic, area-by-area ,VaSls.

1.	Strategic Hamlet Program. The strategic hamlet program embodies principally the recommendations of the British Advisory Mission, headed by R.G.K. Thompson, a key figure in the campaign against Communist insurgency in Malaya. It also reflects US innovations and the experience and concepts developed by the GVN in similar earlier projects. Briefly, the program involves regrouping hamlets into fortified and more readily defendable settlements and undertaking in these settlements political, social, and economic measures designed to weed out Viet Cong agents and sympathizers, reestablish and improve local government administration, improve the general popular image of the GVN, and increase the peasantry’s identification with the government’s fight against the Viet Cong. The program is initiated in relatively secure areas and is then expanded into less secure areas. The majority of the hamlets provide most of their own resources, although the US is supplying some of the equipment and necessary construction materials and it is expected that this aid will increase substantially.
The strategic hamlet program is now priority national policy. President Diem has created a special interministerial committee to implement and coordinate the program on a countrywide basis. The committee is headed by Diem's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, and delegates its responsibilities to regional committees under each of the army division commanders. Increasing efforts have been made to regularize the procedure for implementing the program, educate the responsible local officials and the peasants on procedures and objectives, speed up the distribution of US material assistance, and train the necessary specialized personnel. The GVN has reported that, as of mid-October 1962, more than 3,000 strategic hamlets had been completed and more than another 2,000 were under construction; more than one-half of these are in the southern provinces, including the Mekong River delta area.
The completed strategic hamlets vary widely in the quality of their physical defenses, the effectiveness of the defense, internal, security, and administrative systems, and the degree to which necessary political, social, and economic measures have been implemented. Among the most effectively organized hamlets are those in areas where integrated and systematic military-political pacification operations have been undertaken, such as "Operation Sunrise" in Binh Duong province and "Operation Sea Swallow" in Phu Yen province. In these and other hamlets, fortifications and the defense forces are adequate for repulsing guerrilla attacks, radio communication has been provided, hamlet administrative officials have been elected or selected by the inhabitants rather than appointed by the village or di ;rict chiefs, and Civic Action teams have been active in improving the healtn, educational, and general living standards of the people. In many other hamlets, however, fortifications are extremely inadequate or virtually nonexistent, defense forces are greatly under-strength and inadequately armed, there are no radio communications or Civic Action teams, and hamlet officials continue to be appointed. Moreover, despite improving peasant morale in many hamlets, particularly as the benefits of security against Viet .Cong intimidation and

taxation become evident, there are continuing reports that GVN officials • have exacted too heavily from local resources and havo not compensated tho peasants for tha material and labor required to build tho hanlots, that tha peasant’s ability to cam a living has doclinod because of tho time he is required to spend on construction, and tlmt the government has boon more concerned with controlling thc hamlet population than with pro-viding services and improving living conditions.
It is still too early for accurate evaluation of tha strategic hamlet program. On balance, the program appaars successful and probably has contributed to tha reported slight increase in tho numbar of parsons and villages that havo coma under effectivo government control. The fact that the strategic hamlets have become a major target for Viet Cong armod attacks is in itself an indicator of tiro importanco of tho program to tho GVN’s counterinsurgency effort, if not a measure of its success. Most of the deficiencies of tho strategic hamlot program appear to be the result of Implementation and, to some extent, are to bo expocted during thc early stages. Many province! and district chiefs continua to bo rolatively unln-formed or confused as to procaduro and objectives or are pverztjalous in thair attempt io impress thoir superiors and thus havo ostablishod unrealistic ' goals. Moreover, sons GVN leaders, including Prosidont Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu, tend to place exaggerated importance on tho program, viewing it almost as a imivorsal panacea to tho Communist insurgency rather than as merely a measure for cutting off tho Viot Cong from tho paasantry. Accordingly, tho strategic h-nlot program has not boon offoctivoly integrated with tho basic military-political pacification effort to eliminate thc Viot Cong gradually and systematically, principally because of tho much more rapid inplemantatloa . of tha strategic hamlot program. As a result, tho necessary basis for tha . continuing defense of tho strategic hamlota does not exist in many of tha areas whore they have boon established.
2.	Systematic MilitaryRolitical Pacification Operations. After considerable dslay, and with the advice^n&lH&Ttlsjji Advisory Mission land US officials, the GVN has developed the general outlines of an Integra’ ad military-political approach for pacifying the country on a systematic, gradual and provincs-by-proVince basis. Tha approach involves large-scale and continuing military operations to deal’ and hold a given province. As the province is cleared, strategic hamlets are ostablishod with Civic Acti* _i teams moving into ths hamlots to direct construction and helb establish a—inist— tive, informational, health, educational, security, and other sarvicos. In March 1962^President Diem approved a “Balta Pacification Plan " callino for the pacification of 11 provinces around Saigon and in the Mekong Rivar delta arsa and embodying most of tha recommendations of the -British Advisory Xfrw ^v^sr security concepts developed by tho CS.

Implementation of the integrated pacification approach began in . March 1962 and since then four operations have been initiated? "Operation Sunrise" in Binh Duong province (and portions cf surrounding provinces), ^Operation Saa Swallow” in Phu Yen proviroo, K0psraticn Let’s Go*3 in Binh Dinh province, and ’’Operation Royal Phoenix’* in Quang Ngal province. Hans for another opcratlon in Vinh Long province, "Opersttien Lt,t>t Wind, are being draun up. In addition to continuing military oparations, over 160 stratogic harlots, the great majority in Phu Yen province, have already been constructed and mor© than an additional 1,000 hamlet-* aro planned for completion by raid-!963 or shortly thereafter.
Tho results of tho systematic, integrated military=political pacification approach aro encouraging. Hovever, its limited application to relatively few provinces has not yot appreciably altered the balance between tho government and the Viot Cong in the covntrysida. Moreover, there is ovidsneo that tha GVN has some doubt as to the feasibility of this approach as the principal basis of its counterinsurgoncy effort. For example, in addition to the heavy reliance on tho strategic hamlet program, there are reports that President Diem fools that his military forces now have sufficient strength and capa-bility to make quick, large-scalo military strikes sim-elt-aneously in and behind various areas of Viot Cong concentration with tho hopo cf dispersing an! ultimately isolating the guerrilla forces into small and easily eliminated packets.

Tha GVN military and security forcos have significantly stoppod up thoir offensive operations against tha Vict Cong insurgents, particularly since ths early part of 1962, In large measure, this has been tha direct result of US agreement to support a substantial increase in the size of the GVN military and security establishmants. Simao the latter part of 1961, tho GVN has increased its military forces from about 160,000 to around 200,000 and its security forces, thc Civil Guard and Solf Difensa .Corps, from just over 90,GOO to almost 19U, 000. This hn enabled tha GVN to satisfy its requirements for defending transportation facilities and What it considers key areas, including the l7th parallel, while It attempts to seek out and eliminate tha Viet Cong.

However It appears that Diem’s willingness to delegate this reopens Lbllity is due partly to his appointment of division commanders whom he believes to be loyal to him and his family. This reliance essentially cn oolonals to direct the fighting reinforces continuing reports that Diem and Ngo . Dinh Nhu still mistrust most of ths generals and even havo doubts as to their military competence. In ary event, Diem and Nhu continue to ploy 'dominant roles in tha development of gencral military strategy and must approve plans for major operations and frcquantly will initiate or modify them.
As a result of the substantial increase in US military assistance ■ and accelerated training programs by US military personnel In South Vietnam, 'who now numbar almost 11,000, the GVN military and security forces havo rapidly dsyelopad considerable count or guerrilla capability. These forces ' —e subst-ntlally better arrnd with weapons and equipment suitable to counter guerrilla warfare. Thoy are now alabushing and patrolling nora than over befora, aro engaging the Viot Cong increasingly Ln small unit- actions, and are following tlirough. their attacks in order to keep the Viot Cong from disengaging. Probably of greater importance, howovor, is the considerably improved tactical mobility of the GVN forces. These forces are now able to strike mere quickly and in greater strength than ever before during defensive,, relief, or offensive operations. Tha single most important reason fcr this accoleratad tactical mobility is tho increasing utilisation cf air power, principally US helicopter support. Although better intelligence and communications, particularly thc installation of radios in moct villages, and improvements in the tactical organisation of the GVN military establishment, have also contributed significantly.
□
The improvement in GVN tactical intelligence is due partly to admin-inistrativa and organizational reforms but principally to the success of IB officials in impressing the So,nth Vietnamese with the necessity for more effective interrogation of Viet Ceng prisoners and to the apparent increase in the willingness of the peasants, at least in areas whare security has improved, to inform on the Viet Cong. On balance, however, GVN intelligence continues to be ssricusly weakened by the shortage of trained personnel" ineffective prisoner interrogation techniquas, overlapping responsibili-tias among several agencies and inter agency rivalries, and* ths continuing reluc-tanco of tha peasantry to inform on the Viet Cong for fear of reprisal particularly in insecure areas or where tha GVN presence is regarded as temporary.'
Despite this improvement in count or guerrilla tactics, GVN military forces continue to rely moro on largo operations or clearing swaeps than or. small-unit actions, employ Civil; Guard and Salf Defense Corps units excess ' lively m independent offensive missions, and, during large operations deploy combat units, particularly artillery and airforce, according — conventLcnal tactical methods.

generally have advance knowledge of major GVN operations, especially when artillery or air power is used to "softcn up" tho enemy, and are able to disperse or avoid engagement.
The increased US support and presence, tha greater role played by GVN military officials in formulating and directing military operations, and more successes against the Viot- Cong than ever before have apparently improved morale among members of the middle and upper echelons of the GVN military establishment. Tho stats of morale at the lower level, however, is more difficult to determine. Insertions, particularly among recruits and recalled reservists, appear to ba running very high for v. wide variety of reasons, and some GVN officials continua to claim serious difficulty in meeting conscription quotas. During the first seven months of 1962, for example, a total cf 17,28? personnel were dropped from the rosters of the Army, Navy, Airforce, Crvil Guard, and Self Daxense Corps as doserters or as personnel absent without official leave. On tho otho! hand, ^ome GIN officials have recently claimed that voluntary candidates have for the first time oversubscribed the quota at tha army officer* s training school at Thu Duc.
III.	THE POLITICAL SITUATION Mill -V' 1-1 ■'■e— - "	W«3aj
A, Background? Rapid Deterioration
Daring 1960 and 1961, -tile internal political situation in South Vietnam deteriorated rapidly, breaking the "relative stability and general surface calm that had prevailed since President Diem consolidated his authority in l9o9-’56c Criticism of Diem increased substantially throughout all sectors of Vietnamese society but was more urgently articulated within the govornraent and bureaucracy, including the armed forces, A wide range of civilian and military officials, including Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho and other members of the cabinet, privately questioned Diem’s handling of the internal security problem and his ability to rally and lead the people against the Viet Cong during what they regarded as tho most critical period since the end of the Indochina var. Their concern with tho Communist threat, however, was almost inseparably entwined with an accumulation of grievances principally over Diem*s failure to delegate responsibility, the excessive power exercised by Diem’s family, and the use of secret security cervices and semicovert political organisations to scrutinise the attitu s of the bureaucracy.
Open deprecation of Diem also increased sharply among intellectuals, professionals, and disgruntled ex-politicians in urban areas, particularly in Saigon, the focal point of non-Communist political opposition to Diem since 19%, and to a lesser extent among labor and business elements, They repeatedly and, on occasion, vociferously deraandad that Diem liberalize and reform his government, lift restrictions on civil liberties, el I minute corruption in government, and permit an opposition to operate. Those demands

SEGRST/NOFORN - 16 -were supported, as in thc past, by a disparate group of anti-Diem Vietnamese expatriates in Paris who have long advocated Diem's removal.
Unrest also increased among the peasantry principally because of tho government’s inability to asstme adequate protection from the Viot Cong but partly because of the cumulative reaction to ths excessively arbitrary and severe behavior of local security ana administrative officials.
Possibly underlying this unrest also was tho character of tha GVN's economic development activities which, however limited, were oriented more toward developing an urban industrial base than toward improving the economic lot of the paasant.
Vietnamese confidence in the Diem government was obviously seriously shaken and morale within the bureaucracy, particularly ths military establishment, declined greatly. In November 1960 a small group of middle level paratroop officers staged a near-successful coup in Saigon. Although the abortive coup obviously mada Diem take serious stock of the prospects for political survival, it also strengthened his confidence in the correctness of his political views and increased his suspicion of many of his subordi-nates and ths oppositionists outside tha government.
During this period also, Diem* s view of US policies toward South Vietnam underwent considerable chango. For the first tima since he consoli-dated his position, Diem appeared to question seriously US political support of his leadership and US commitments to defend South Vietnam from Communist encroachment. His apparent concern, although partly reflecting his d isc.gr ec-ment With US actions in Laos, was duo largely to earlier persistent US rep-resentations on internal issues which he regarded as pressing him unduly to reform and liberalize his regime. This concern was further aggravated by his belief, partly instilled by members of his family, that ths US Was in some way involved in the abortive coup,
During tha immediate post-coup period, Diem took a number of measures to strengthen his controls over tha bureaucracy. Ha and Ngo Dinh Nhu math it publicly and privately clear that future coup attempts or even public criticism of tha govornmant would be dealt with sovereiy. Ths Can Lao tha government’s semicovert political control organization, and~tho"^ecret police were ordered to maintain close surveillance over critics within the bureaucracy and the military establishment and over tho oppositionists outsido tha government, and officials were apparently instructed that passing information to or even having social relations with Americans would lead to serious consoquences. As a result, there was a sharp decline in the heretofore large number of reports on coup plotting and criticism of Ihen and his family. In the meantima, Diem reportedly organized a’ counter_ coup group from among the most loyal membars of the Can Lao,the bureaucracv and the military and security services.

During tha last half cf 1?61, the political situation became soms-w’lat less disturbed, despite the continuing rapid dot erioration of security conditions. The predominant factor in this development was external: strong US public manifestations of support for Diem, including the vioit. of Vice President Johnson and General Maxwell Taylor, and tho substantial increase in US assistance to South Vietnam. Other contributing factors wero the slightly greater participation that Diem now appaared to permit his military advisers in the conduct of the fighting, the favorable psychological effect on the middle and lower military echoions of a few largo offensive operations, and Diem’s initiation of some modest political reforms, However, there was no conclusive reversal of deteriorating trends as was made clearly evident when Diemss palace was bombed by two GVN airforce , pilots in February l?62»
B. The Current Situation
The political situation in South Vietnam is now probably more complex and more difficult to analyze than at any time since 1994. On tho one hand, the sense that political reform is urgently needed appears to have subsided significantly, at least onr the surface, and indaed a relative calm seems again to have descended over tho bureaucracy,- There has been a significant decline in reports of serious discontent, and of criticism by GVN officials of Diem’s leadership and his family. Reports of tho concern of officials with inefficiency, corruption, and morale in the government have likevri.se declined significantly since the early part of 1962, as have reports on coup plotting, Some US officials believe that morale within the bureaucracy and tho military services has improved appreciably, largely because of tho improved capabilities of the armed forces and several large successful operations against the Viot Cong; that some heretofore strong oppositionists aro now seeking to identify themselves with tho government and contribute positively to the war efforts and that peasant loyalty is shifting toward the government, particularly in areas where the government is making its presence increasingly felt. Finally, Diem and his principal lieutenants have very recently shown considerable confidence and optimism that tho tide has been turned against tho Viet Cong and have even stated that a general offensive is about to be launched.
On the other hand, tho indicators of serious internal political instability remain, however diminished ih apparent intensity, and are as vm-ied as the indicators of political stability. Thera are reports f^om officials from various levels of the administration, including Vice President no and Generals D-ong Van lunh and Le Van Kim, that Diem continues to run the war hrmself cr through his inner circle of confidants, that corruption within the government continues .unabated (as evident in the recent national o tory scandal, that thor-e is no political consolidation of military suc-inSthZ *£aGSt C^5 th9 countrys^Q, that indiscriminate bombing

exoloitaticn and the belief that the US would not tolerate a coup keep it from materializing. As recently as late October 1962, Gen, Ton That Dim, commander of Army Corps II and generally considered one of the most loyal although opportunistic of Diem/s generals, stated that hs was highly, dissatisfied with the regime, that Diem and Nhu tolerate corruption in high places, and that he was planning to precipitate a coup in early February 1963.
1.	Political Attitudes of Diem and His Family. Diem and his family remain f'irmly convinced of the wisdom oi their political outloo.. and of their method of governing their country. They are basically impatient with democratic processes. They consider democracy a useful goal but its methods they regard as wasteful and as dangerous to political stability and public safety in a country such as South Vietnam. They contend there-fore that the Vietnamese people, with their national survival at stake, must submit to a collective discipline until they develop a greater national consciousness and a batter sense of civic responsibility. While willing to rule within tha framework of constitutional and representative government, they are firm in their convictions that government is effective and dynamic only' when its power is closely hold and exercised by a small, higlily dedicated, and uncompromising element at tho very top through a machinery-founded more on personal relationships and loyalty than on formal or institutional chains of command. Where representative government and civil liberties come in conflict with the highly centralized authority, tho latter generally prevails. Finally, Diem and his family continue to bolievo strongly, almost fanatically, that their leadership is crucial if not indispensable to the survival of their country in tho present crisis.
Soma slight modifications have slowly appoared in these attitudes during the past year, partly because Diem and his family are increasingly aware that tho Communist threat to South Vietnam is largely internal, and partly because of the magnitude and complexity of the US assistance program and its increasing orientation toward the needs of the countryside. More than ever before, they have been made aware that government must not only be .served but must also serve, that the peasant and his active participa-tion rather than his passive obedience may well be crucial for final victory over the Viet Cong, and that a little more sharing of power at the top would probably improve administrative efficiency rather than lead to their ouster.
At tho same time, hows ver, Diem and especially Nhu have gone to great lengths to convince US officials that this has always becn their oasic approach to government and to elaborate on what it means for the peasant. Nhu has repaatedly stated that the strategic hamlet program lor example will create a social, economic, and political revolution* the countryside, which will uproot vested economic interests

- 19 -however either in recent developments or in the records of past porform-ance, particularly Nhu’s, that such are thair real objsctivos and expectations.
Probably ths most significant change is in Diem's attitude toward tha US. Ha has apparently become substantially perauadad that L3 defense commitments to South Vietnam are firm, despite his continued disagreement with the US on the Laotian problem. His earlier suspicions that the US was looking for a successor in South Vietnam and that tho IS was implicated in the abortive 19& coup have baen considerably relieved. On the othor hand, Diem has remained firm against cry US prossuro on matters that ho interprets as vital to his own and his government's best interests and is . convinced that in the final analysis he can have absolute confidence only-in himself and in his family.
2.	Diem and the BOTeaucrocv- Blew probably has somewhat strengthened his controSTcdF’the* 'administration. For example, ho has reorganized a number of his agoncios, has removed a number of critical and potentially disloyal officials and by various mans neutralized tho influence of como others, such as Vice President Tho and Gen. Duong Van Minh, and has improved his moans of survoillanco of tho bureaucracy through cuch tcchniquee as the creation in tho military cstablishmont of a. system of "political commissars" known as ths Political Welfare Division. He has attempted to roinforco further his control of tho military establishment by tha appointment of personally loyal colonels as division commanders, some of whom have domon-strated from time to time that they regard their responsibility as principally to Diem rathar than to thoir corps conmndors.
On balance, however, it appears that tha genoral efficiency of tha administration has improved slightly, partly beoauso of tha appointment of more competent officials to several key positioiic:, partly because of somo increase in tho authority delegated by Diem, and portly because of the enlarged IS presence in South Vietnam. For example, Socretary of State for tha Presidency l’gtryon Dinh Thuan appears to ba exercising greater authority than before, as is Secretary of Stato for Interior^Bui Van Luong who, like the head of the now Central Intelligence Organization Col. lfeuyon Van Y, and Secretary of State for Public Health Tran Dinh Do, is among the ncwly-r.ppointcd and more competent members of Diem’s entourage in Saigon. At Diemrs initiative, the National Assembly recently passed an amendment to ths constitution enabling it to call upon members*of Diem's cabinet to give testimony on pending legislation.
Diem also has bacoma increasingly aware of the need to revive and accelerate training programs for his tivil service and has boon somewhat more selective in his appointment of middla echolon officials and province s' As a reSurb of 1110 increased number of US advisers,particularly at thjs level of tha government, some of these officials havo also shown a

somewhat greater willingness to act on their own initiative and to attempt to improve their general effectiveness in such matters as military planning md operations, information and propaganda, intelligence, and Civic Action. Finally, there has bean greater consultation and coordma-tion of activities batucen GVN and US officials in Saigon which in turn has tended to reduce delays in the formulation and implcmontauion o
policies.
Nevertheless, participation by the central elements of the adminis-tration in Saigon in the formulation and direction of policies, as Well as initiat’va and constructive criticism upward from its middle and lower echelons, continue to bo restricted seriously. -Diem and his family continue to operate the government largely on tho basis of personal relationships rather than through tho regular or formal channels of command. They havo remained steadfast against any US pressure to broaden government participation at tho top, and have Leon keenly alert and highly sensitive to tho possibility that the role of US advisers in tho field or at tha middle and lower echelons of the administration may woaken their authority outside Saigon.
3.	Diem’s Position in tha Countrywide. Diem has never had widespread popular appaaiNand’support,' even during his period of greatest achievemont, 1999-58. An austere and disciplined introvert, he is incapable of demagog-uery and has never made a great effort to the extent that Friree Sihanouk of Cambodia and Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam, for example, havo done so — to inspire among tha South Vietnamese people a national consciousness centered and moulded around him personally. While he has enacted measures that have helped tha peasants, he has not attempted to identify himself intimately with tha peasants. Relatively few peasants have ever seen Diem or hoard him speak, and there are probably many others who are not aware that he is head of the government. For the great majority of peasants, tho district chief is probably tho highest government official with whom there has been any notable degree of contact.
Diem undoubtedly has becomo increasingly at rare of the serious need to improve the public image of himself, his family, and his government. Ho now travels extensively in the countryside, and his manner of talking with tho peasant has become more relaxed and sympathetic than bsfore; during tho last half of 1961, for example, Diem mads 18 knottitrips outside Saigon and visited 19 provinces, 9 in tho central and northern parts of tha country and 10 in the south. Both Diem and Nhu have from tins to time attended tha inauguration of relatively small rural projects. With UB assistance, the GVN is expanding -its information and Civic Action programs at tha village level and has become more conscious of the need to conduct these activities along lines understood and appreciated by the peasant. Finally, there are reports that a number of the villages and hamlets wnich have been given arms have resisted tha Viet Cong, instead of surrendering their weapons as some GVN officials had expected they would do.

There saaias to ba some feeling among GVN and US officials operating at tha local level that tha popular appeal of and support for Diem and his government in tha countryside is improving, particularly in areas where security has improved end the governments3 power is increasing. However, they varn against any undue optimism, particularly since they believe social and economic advances are still not keeping pace with military successes, and that the positive identification of the peasantry with the government is still a long way off. Wie over a 100,000 Monta^iard or mountain tribaspeople have fled Viet Cong-controlled areas and are being temporarily housed and fed by tha GVN, their flight apparently was due principally to Viot Cong excesses and the general intensification cf the fighting tn tha highlands rather than to any positive measures taken by ths GVN to appeal to the tribespeople. The extensive use' of artillery and aerial bombard-ment and other apparently excessive and indiscriminate measures by GVN military and security fences in attempting to eliminate tha Viet Cong havo undoubtedly killed many innocent peasants and made marry others more willing than before to ccoparate with the Viet Cong, particularly in areas whore the government has conducted extensive military operations, but has failed to follow up by providing the means .for permanent security.
h. Di^s Position in Unban Canters. Diem’s legitimacy as South Vletaam-s national load r may bo, at bast, a vagus and impsrsonil concept In tha countryside. It is seriously questioned, however, among mry elements of ths urban society, principally among professionals, intelLoctuals, and former politicians in Saigon. As in tha recent past, this questioning largely continues to taka ths form of dissent and privata criticism rather than openly organized opposition. Within this educated end politically sensitive sector of tha Vietnamese society, thcro is a wide variety cf political sentitaaats, Including varying degress c-fViotnehoso nationalism, neutralism, coasttonism, pro-US and anti-US, and-pro “French and anti-French. The common themes among these critics and active opponents of Diem continue to ba related to his system end manner of rule.
Reports of open criticism and opposition to Diem among ths SaiGn civilian elite, already on tha decline by early 1961, havo decreased ' further during this year. little has been heard, for example, cf Dr. Phan Quang Hilfs Republican party of Vietnam (Dan himself has been In Trison. since the 1960 coup attempt), of GVN-sraated or GVN-controlled Boppcs?—i’’ groups, or cf ths once Vociferous critics of Diem, such as the 18 in—-tu-ils and ex-politicians who signed a public pretest petition to Di—in" 1960, The probable causes for this ds clime in reports are variedg GVN repression and increased fear of repression; ths increased realUatlor that there is little tho oppositionists can do legally to chaags ccndi ticiuf particularly in view of reaffirmed IS support for Dlerao and incr&as^d... concern over tha possibility of Communist exploitation— any—

This relative surface silence might be regarded as an ih.ica-tor of improvement in Diem’s position with the urban'public if it wore not for thc increasing number of reports of clandestine activities by his non-Coemunist critics and opponents. Factional leaders of such ole and once important political groups as the Dai Viets and tho Nationalist Party of Vietnam (VEQDD) reportedly are seeking ways to gev their members secretly installed in the government. (There is evidanco of some collusion betwaan elements of ono of these groups and tho two pilots Who bombcd Diem's palace in February l?62.)

It also appears that expatriate groups in Franco, such as th© Democratic Party of Vietnam, are attempting to expand their covert activities in Saigon.
While it appears that Diem has not improved his standing among urban groups there is no cvidcnca that tha arti^Diem intellectual-elite elements in Saigon have been ablo to overcome their chronic disunity and sectarian-ism or°to increase their very small followings. On the other hand, Diemrs persisting disdain of most of these oppositionists and his refusal to bring into tha government evon soma of their least reprehensible -members have ■contributed to a growing noitralist continent among then and, by forcing many of them under cover, have made it extremely difficult to estimate their real strength and disruptive potential. In addition to tho growing appsal of neutralism among them, thoir pro-US orientation may also ba rapidly declining.
IV. ECONOMIC TRENDS
*	V
Thera has been little inflationary pressuro in South’ Viotnam as yet. Prices have been stable and tho monoy supply has been nearly constant for over a year. For example, in August 1962, total money supply, made up of demand deposits in the banks and currency in circulation, was only fraction-ally above what it had been in March 1961. Further, prices have been genarally stablr and ths cost of living in tho cities has risen only very slowly.
Tho stability in money supply and prices that has boon such a marked feature of tha Vietnamese economy has been tha direct result of very conservative .G7H policies with respect to prices, wages, and fiscal management. So long as tha immediate problem in .South Vietnam was reconstruction/ i.e., tha restoration of production to prc-Norld kbr II lovels it was possible to obtain substantial increases in output at relatively small cost, and conservative pr leakage and fiscal policies were not only useful but also to some extent necessary. ' Although GVN policios have been more conservative in nature than was really required (for example, budget surpluses from 1954 to 19^9 amounted to a total of 2.7 hillion biastars) thsy havo kept thc specter of inflation from adding yot another element 6f instability to tha scene..

Since tha reconstruction phase ended In about 19o9} GVN economic policy has preserved the status quo in the country's lda, including ths' traditional disparity bertwesn rural and urban living standards, and has not stimtaatsd oconottc daTelopsuant. Thore aro some indications, in fact feat thar© hao recently been net disinvestment in agriculture. Given tha security situation in th* countryside and the current depressed state of trada thsra. revised policios directed toward increasing rural income and production would be an ossentittl elcront in pm us. ding tho peasants to cast thotr lot with the government and rot With ths Viet Cong.
Two encouraging davclcpmsaits have occmrcd in ths economic field in South Vietnam in the last several, months. First, tha Second Five-Year Plan was endorsed by the National Assembly la Jura and approved by President Diem. The Flan calls for the iuvestrnsIst ‘of 49 billion piasters
over the period 1962-1966 and emphasiacs ths devalemmsni of agriculture, public Works, and industry. On 30 ilia National Assembly appropriated an j-dt-itt 1,2 billion pimsiars to finanoa tho piaster costs of several projact-Sjinpn-p of them in thc’agricultural sector.
Second, President Di cm, in his state of the nation-message to the National Assembly en October ls emphasised that agriculture is tha economic base of South Victim and trust have priority in dovelopmont. Ho also said that private invostment must b® encouraged and provided tho rationale for deficit financing by-pointing out that a developing nation normally experiences a buc^jotory deficit. Mem referred to tha necessity of raising tho living standards of tha rural population} and said that tho present guaranteed minimum wage won3.d be re-examined because of tho rise in tho cost of living. Although measures to implement naw economic policies may not bo’presented to thc National Assembly until its next regular session in April 1963. Diem’s atatcments indicate a now awarunsss that the trend of declining income among tha lowest incoma groups must ba reversed. This awareness is ©n-ouraglng but, unless the additional income gencratsd by deficit financing is largely directed to tho countryside and to tha lowsr income urban groups, the price rises resulting from deficit financing will maroly widen the income gap which already exists and further alk aate" : the peasants from ths GVN. ' Moreover , tho additional income must be curoctad co tna rural aecis in. such a v.ay as to encourage Agrim] jmral production. Stable and attractive prices for farm products aro tha be t and perhaps only maans to accomplish this.

Viot Cong activities in South Vietnam can ba expected to have a depressing affect on agricultural production, although tha major detorminants will continue to be price, the wsathsr, and agricultural tech-niquos, including the use of fertiliser, and improved seed.

the rubber trees was partially responsible for the dsclinc but an important additional cause was clandestine tapping by tho Viet Cong and general insocurlty which'interfered with legitimate tapping on the estates Ld extension of tho planted area. Also, ths govermont’s urgent financial needs arising from tha omargency havo prevented it since 1960 from making anything moro than token payments in support of its rubbar roplanuing program. Given the vulnerability of the estates, there is littlo prospect for an improvement in tha rubber situation until security improvos generally.
It can also' bo expected that Viet Cong harassment wlll continue to interfere with We transport system, especially tho railroads. The result ion of night passenger operations between Saigon and Huo on SoptAbor 16 was apparently not based on any improvcmont in security out on tho hope that the Viet Cong would not 'sabotage trains carrying passengers. The resumption may havo also been duo to the fact that acidiui.on.il rovonuos aro urgently needcd in view of tho 10 million piaster monthly deficit on railway operations.
If President Diem’s statements on October 1 aro followed by the necessary measures to stimulate dovelopment of the agricultural sector in South Viotnam, which accounts for tho employment of 60/ of tha population, important stops will havo boon taken not only to provide tho peasantry with tho motivation to side with tho govornmont but also to direct economic development along ths lines most promising for tho economic future of South Vietnam. This will bo particularly tho case if tho GVN's economic development program also emphasizes industries utilising don c st ic ally producod raw materials, particularly agricultural onsa, as wall as those that provide import substitutes but are based solely on imported raw materials.
In short, the GVN is showing a new awareness of tho necessity of directing its attention to programs which will directly bond it the rural J population. It has not as yet put into effect any concrete measures to carry out its program. Its actions in thc next six months to a year will indicate how deep its new-found conviction is.
V. OUTLOOK
A. Communist Actions
There sso-3 littlo prospect that tha Viot Cong will ba able to achieve a take-over of South Vietnam by armed force during tho next year. The CoiSnunists are obviously prepared for a long struggle. Evan though tho strongthoned GVN response and increased US assistance have apparently necessitated soma modification of plans, it is not likely that tho Communists will diminish their diversified campaign of guerrilla warfare terrorism, and subversion. They can be expected to maka every effort — mintain, consolidate, end expand thoir control of tha countryoido. increase their overall armed strength, tha number of organised fighting u-uts,- and tha percentage of hard-core personnel in those units: improve air weapons capability particularly against halicoptors; and increase

tliair attacks against strategic hamlets. Acts of terrorism, pervlcala.ly against Americans, and sabotage* partiotiLarly of trains and important installations may well increase to unprecedented prcportusns in an oilcrt to tie down more GW military and security forces and thus relieve thc pressure against tha Viet Cong.
Hanoi can also be expected to continue to infiltrate personnel and material into South Vietnam and has the capability to step up infiltration, as tho situation warrants, with relatively little danger of de lection and no great difficulty. The IRV’s capability is further enhanced by the nature of the border terrain and the limited border-control capabilities of thc South Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian governments. However, because of tactical and strategic military and political considerations, Hanoi will probably continue to infiltrat-Q elements primarily from tho pool of regrouped South Vietnamese rather than from the Vietnamese Communist farces in Laos most of whom are believed to bo North Vietnamsso or Tonkinese,
It is entirely possible that the Viet Cong will step up its armed operations during the next month or so with the advent of the dry season, in the belief that further military escalation is necessary in order to counter the growing response and effectiveness of the GVN forces and US support. Thore are a number of indicators that support this expectation? nwserous earlier intelligence reports of Viet Cong ragroupmaat and consolidation of forces; a slight increase in the numbsr of armed incidents during roughly the last wook of October; and tuo Viet Cong battalion-sice attacks in the Making River delta area in late October and early November 1962, the first since July 1962. Further military escalation during the next sevaral months night involve the formation of regimental-size units, including tha transformation of soma guerrilla units into conventional units with heavier weapon^ selected and simultaneous larga attacks aoainst one or more targets, including military installations and tot-ms; astablish-m.ent of »1iberat9d areas’* in South Vietnam; the creation of reserve bases in Commuaist-hald areas in southern Laos; and Increased infiltration, particularly if Communist forces in southern Laos can provide adequate protection along infiltration routes. (It does not appear likely’that inspection by the International Control Ccmmlssi.cn in Laos wm sericuslv Impede Commur.ist infiltration.)

In urban areas, the Viet Cong will rely on terrorism to demoralize the citizenry and on increased propaganda and subversion to inspire anti-Diem demonstrations and coup plots, encourage neutralise sentiment and^ in general, gain support for its ^united front’1 tactics among non-Comtmist oppositionists and youth and labor groups.
Outside South Vietnam, Hanol will- probably increase its diplomatic ana propagr-nda efforts to gsln support pwtl«a»3j mong neutag. nations for tha ’'National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam" (hmSt). It may have sons success in establishing “unofficial” relations between the NFLSV and Laotian and Cambodian leaders, in gaining support for tho NFLSV amon^ Vietnsmesa minorities in Laos, Cambodia,- and Thailand, and in persuading prominent Vietnamese expatriates in Eraneo to support a change of government in South Vietnam. In addition to advocating th^ reunification of Vietnam, Hanoi and the NFLSV can bo expected to continue propaganda support for the neutralization of South Vietnam. Howovar, tho extent to which neutralization is emphasized will depend on tho course of the wav in South Vistntm and the degree to which tha concept is found to ■ appaal to tho elements in and outside South Vietnam, as uoll as on develop-ronts in. the Bloc itself.
The pattern of events relating to tho creation and development of the HFLSV, as wall as tho pattern of Communist political tactics and strategy in similar situations in other countries in tho past,-indicates that Hanoi and tho Viet Cong are preparing tho groundWork for transformation of the NKLSV into a shadow or "liberation govarmput'5 in South Vietnam. Howaver, it is extremely difficult to predict whan, whather, or under what conditions this will occur. ELmoi. might find it politically advantageous to create a shadou government under any ona of the following circumstancess during a period of internal political crisis in South Vioteiam following a successful or near-successful coup attemptj during a period When there has been a series of major and dramatic Viet Cong military successasj during a period of sorious military or diplomatic reverses for the US in the Far Eastj cr at a t—19 when several neutralist countries had given assurances of diplomatic recognition of a new "government13 in South Vietnam. Under any circumstances, however, the decision would be considerably infiu.cn cod by Moscow and Peiping and their estimate of tho general international situation.
B• 0^ Countar 1 nsurganoy Effort
Tho elimination and even the significant reduction of the Ccranunist insurgency in South Vietnam trill almost certainly require soveral years. Homever, in addition to continuing US assistmoo, a considerably greater effort by the GVN is crucial. An effective strategic military-political concept for implementing tho GVN counter insurgency plan has been developed mid 13 now bsing acted upon, and tha armed and security forcos have been enlargad and improved. GVN success will in large measure depsnd on the monnor and speed with which it continues to implement this concept.

Ultimately- however, the effectiveness of its implementation will depend on the willingness of Diem and his family to utilise fully the basic resources available to the GVN. Tire GVN military loaders are among the bpst in Southeast Asia and the rank and file have the spirit and willingness to fight; ths -civilian bureaucratic leadership is strongly anti-Conroinist/evoa though its effectiveness continues to ba imyoded by inadequate delegation of authority 3 there are as yat no serious trends towai’d neutnlim or toward a political accoamod&vion wieh K not., —a f?natty, tha Vietnamese peasants, however politically apathotic and discontented with tha goverru»nt, are by no means ready to surrender themselves to the Viat Cong, given greater effort by tha government to protect them from Comrnmlst intimidation and improve their economic and political, status.
Daring the next year, thc GVN probably will not be able to halt completely the dstsriorating security trends, let alone reverse the ti.de against ths Viet Cong, unless Saigon significantly accelerates and improves its response to tl.o insurgency. Among other things, the government leadership h—t give ranch greater emphasis to political, social, and economic measures in support of it a military operations, naka a sub stsht Lally greater effort to integrate the strategic hamlet pregrata into a ccntinnlng systematic pacification effort, and appreciably improvs its counter guerrilla tactics and capabilities, including increased reliance on small -uni t actions and restriction of tha tactical use of air-potter and artillery. Failure to do this will seriously weaken tho strategic hamlet program, particularly since the Viet Cong can ba expected to stop up ir. - efforts against tha program during the next year. Such failure will also greatly rositict ths ability of the GVN to weaken Viet Gong capabilitios, to ecae^lidate its cun nillttmy successes into permanent- politJxal gains, and to evoke, particularly among the peasants, the needad greater sansa of stake in the government's fertunes. Indeed, the continuation of such tactical measure? as extensive use of airpovor and crop destruction, however carefully controlled may well contribute to the development of militant opposition among the peasants and positive identification with the Viet Cong.
Progress against the insurgents will probably remain difficult to evaluate accurately. There are many indicators on the basis of which progress can ba judged; the more meaningful would appear to ba ths "peasants’ willingass to inform on tha Vist Cong and to defend'themsolves against” Viet Cong attacks, and Viet Cong vmapoas losses, shortages of food and medicine, and detections. In this rasp set, a national program by the to ensomeaga Viet Cong defections, with tha promise of fair treatment of tna,defectore is long overdue and could bs extremaly affective in ii-proving GVN intelligence and weakening Viet Cong morale.

The course of US-GVN relations Will ba an important element in the struoglo against the Viot Cong and in sustaining South Viotn-meso morale. The fact that the US 1$ South Vietnam’s only source of significant support and assistance is ths controlling factor in GVN relations and attitudes toward tho US. Dospito considerable improvement in relations between tho IS end the GVN during tha past year or so, disagreements and frustrations con bo exnectod to continuc over a numbor o,. issuos, including uha implementation of the counterinsurgency plan and GVN relations with Laos and Cambodia.
Diem trill almost certainly continue to press for incroasod aid and remain adamant agahist any US pressures upon him to delegate appreciably more authority to his cabinet and military advisors or to expand tho political baso of his government to any significant extent. Moreover, While ha has wolcomcd tha increased US presence in South Vietnam and generally approved of tho activities of U3 adviser a in thc countryside, Diem and his family will continue to maintain a close wotch over those activities in ■ the interests of protecting thnir authority.at tha local level. Diem and particularly Nhu way also remain oxtramaly rpluntaai to accept possible IB proposals directed toward further integration of tho strategic hamlot and systematic pacification programs or directed towerd substantially altering tho present baLanco between emphasis on purely military mcasuros to defeat tho Viot Cong and emphasis on political, social, and oconomi.c measures.
Diem probably still has soma lingering suspicion of the extent of US confidence in and support of his leadership. In tha event of anothor coup attempt, Dion would cxpect quick and strong manifestations of US support and Would regard tho absence of such manifestations as dsraonstra-ting lack of US confidonce.
There is considerable evidence that thc substantial Increase in he IB prasonco in South Viotnam has improved morale at all levels of tho GVN administration. Rotations betuaen individual US advisors and thoir GVN ' countsrparts especially- at the local levol have gonerally boen good and despite Viot Cong propaganda efforts, have not resulted in any noticeab j dogroo of association of tho US prpscnco with tho former French presence. Anons tho probablo major considerations are the fact that US personnel wlLka tho French in tho past, are acting as advisers ratharthan as ~ ’ Rectors and implomantegs of GVN policy, and tho apparent willtr^ncss 01, U3 military personnel to live and oporato clots sly with th sir GVN counterparts, assisting nora by example rather than by parsumion.

Vietnam began in late 1959 to estimate reliably tho elements that most likely to precipitate a coup attempt, tha prospects for tho success of
a coup attempt, or tho effects of such, an attempt c-n internal stability and on the coenterinsurgency effort itself. Daring the past year or so, thc Viet Cong presumably has improved its ability to inltiato a coup and might attempt to do so. However, the Viet Cc-ng probably would not bo able
to of ba
carry out a successful coup, and the odds that it could gain control a successful coup, although somawhat bettor than last year, appear to less than oven.
Tho coup most likely to succeed would be one With Iion-Communist leadership and support, principally involving South Vietnamese military elements and civilian officials and perhaps sems oppositionists outs ids ths govemmant. Ths abortive coup attest in November 1960 and ths palace bombing in February 1962 have undoubtedly demonstrated to coup plotters tha necessity for better preparation and broader participation by thc military.

Diem’s removal — whether by a military coup, assassination, or death from accidental or natural causos — would probably considerably strengthen thc power of the military. Tho odds appoar about even between a government led by a military junta or by Vico President Tiro, with tho army, in tho latter case, playing a major if not tho predominant rolo behind the scencs. On ths one hand, tha military might concluda that a military-lad government would bo batter able to maintain national unity - and internal political cohesion end, more importantly, to conduct a daterrainod and effective campaign against tha Viot Cong. On. tho other bond, they might conclude that Tho, Who apparently has boon on good terms with some of tha present top military loaders, would not disagree With their views on tha manner of conducting tho fight against ths Communists and that his constitutional succession would legalizo the change in government and possibly avert a ebrious power struggle, (Although Diem’s brothers, Elm and Can, would probably also bo removed by a coup, if Dlsm left tho scone for other ran.sons his brothers might attempt to retain real political power.) In any ovant, a government led by tha military, by Tho, er by my other civilian approved by tho military would probably maintain South Vietnam’s pro-US orientation.
If the-rc is a serious disruption of government leadership as a result of a military coup or as a result of Diem’s death, any momentum thc government* s counterinsurgency efforts had achiovod would probably bo haLtod and possibly reversed, at least for a tiro, Moreover, tho confusion and suspicion attending tha disruption would provide the Vict Cong guorrillas an opportunity to strengthen their position in tho country-side and r.tt-ck some installations in largo force, but thay would probably fall if they attempted to seise control of tha govornmant.
Uhdar most of tho foreseeable circunstancss involving a coup, tho rolo of tho US would ba extremely important. Although this— by no means certain, US military and intelligence officials might well havo advance notice of an imp-ending corp and might bo able to restrain tho coup plotters from precipitous action. Evon if unable to restrain .such action, however, US officials might have greater success in averting t/idosproad fitting and a serious power struggle which would load to excessive blood" shod and weaken thc front against tho Viet Cong. Tho US could also be helpful in achieving agrecmont among thc coup leadsrs as to who should h^ad tha govewment and in restoring the rnnaatum of the government's counter-insurgency effort.

A.	We believe that Communist progress has been blunted and that the situation is improving. Strengthened South Vietnamese capabilities and effectiveness, and particularly US involvement, ■ . are causing the Viet Cong increased difficulty, although there are as yet no persuasive indications that the Communists have • been grievously hurt. {Paras. 27-28)
B.	We believe the Communists will continue to wage a war of attrition, hoping for some break in the situation which will lead to victory. They evidently hope that a combination of military pressure and political deterioration will in time create favorable circumstances either for delivering a coup de grace or for a po-. litical settlement which will enable them to continue the struggle on more favorable terms. We believe it unlikely, especially in ' • '	• • view of the open US commitment, that the North Vietnamese
regime will either resort to overt military attack or introduce acknowledged North Vietnamese military units into the south •	in an effort to win a quick victory. {Paras. 29-31)
C.	Assuming no great increase in external support tO the Viet Cong, changes and improvements which have occurred during _ the past year now indicate that the Viet Cong can be contained militarily and that further progress can be made in expanding .	the area of government COntrOl and in creating greater security

Continuing the briefing, Mr. Hilsman said that the Buddhists contained an actiVist element which undoubtedly favOred increasing demands as well as charcinj the Government v/ith ara~ginff its fest. There was thus an element of truth in Diem’s view that the Buddhists mi^ht push their demands so far as to make his fall inevitable.
During these events the US had put extremely heavy pressure on Diem to take political actions. Most recently we had urged Diem to make a speech V/hich Would include announcements that he intended to meet with Buddhist leaders, permit Buddhist chaplains in the army and so on. If Diem did not make such a speech and there Were further demonstrations, the US would be compelled publicly to disassociate itself from ths GVil’s Buddhist policy. Mr. Hilsraan reported that Diem had received this approach V/ith what seemed 1c be
, excessive politeness but had said he would consider maUnn such a speech.
Cur estimate was that no matter what Diem did there will be coup attempts ore. the next four months. Whether or not any Of these attempts will be successful is impossible to say.
Mr. Hilsman said that everyone agreed that the chances Of chaos in the wake of a coup are considerably less than they were a year aoo. An encouraging sign relative to this point is that the war between, the Vietnamese forces and the Viet Cong has been pursued thi'ouqhout the Budchist crisis ' without noticeable let-up.
At this point LDr. Forrestal reported On General Krulak’s views that, euen if Gtere Were chaos in Saigon, the military units in the field would continue to ccriront the Communists.
Mr. Hilsman wont on to say that Ambassador Melting believes that Mie most likely result of a coup attempt that Succeeded in killing Diem waa civil war. Mr. ntlsnan disagreed with tills view slightly in that he thOuuht ciVil war was not the most likely result but that it was certainly a possible result.
The timinq of Ambassador Nolting's return and Ambassador Lodge’s assumption of duty was then discussed. The President’s initial view was that, .Ambassador KOltinn should return immediately and that AnDoa-sador Lccre should assume his duties as seen thereafter as pcssible. The president volunteered that Ambassador Nolting had done an outstanding job, that it was almost miraculous the way he had succeeded in tuming Ute war around from tile

/ disastrously low point in relations between Diem and ourselves that existed when zlmbasGador NOltinC took oyer. Mr. Hilsman pointed out the personal sacrifices chat Ambassador Nolting had been forced to make during Ulis period, and the President said that ho hoped a Vzay could be found to commend Ambassador Nolting publicly so as to make- clear tire fine job he had done and
• that he hoped an appropriate position could bo found for him in Washington so that he could five his children a suitable home in. tha years immediately ahead.	“	•	• >•

The President’s decision was to delegate the authority to decide On tile timing of Ambassador Moltin-j's return tO the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs; that Ambassador Ledge should report to V/ashinston no later titan July 15 so that he COuld take the Counterinsurcfcncy Course simultaneously V/ith th? normal briefings for an ambassador; and that AmhasSador Ledge should arriVe in Saigon as soOn. as possible folloT/ing completion of the CI Course on August 14.

SCOPE NOTE
NIE 53J63, “Prospects in South Vietnam,” dated 17 April 1933 was particularly concerned with the progress of the counterinsurgency effort, and with the military and political factors most likely to affect that effort. The primary purpose of the present SNIE is to examine the implications of recent developments in South Vietnam for the stability cf the country, the viability of the • Diem regime, and its relationship with the US.
CONCLUSIONS
A.	The Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam has highlighted and intensified a widespread and longstanding dissatisfaction with the Diem regime and its style of government. If—as is likely— Diem faiIs to carry out truly and promptly thc commitments he has made to the Buddhists, disorders will probably flare again and the chances of a coup or assassination attempts against him will become better than even. {Paras. 4, 14)	•
B.	The Diem regime’s underlying uneasiness about the extent of the US involvement in South Vietnam has been sharpened by the Buddhist affair and the firm line taken by the US. This attitude will almost certainly persist and further pressure to reduce the US presence in the country is likely. (Paras. 10-12).
C.	Thus far, the Buddhist issue has not been effectively exploited by thc Communists, nor does it appear tO have had any appreciable effect on the counterinsurgency effort. We do not think Diem is likely to be OVerthrown by a Communist coup. Nor do we think the Communists would necessarily profit if he were overthrown by some combination of his non-Communist opponents. A non-Communist successor regime might be initially less effective against the Viet Cong, but, given continued . • support from the US, could provide reasonably effective leadership for the government and the war effort.

DISCUSSION
I.	INTRODUCTION	.	'	.	.
1.	The two chief problems which have faced the Government of South Vietnam (GVN) since its birth in 1954 havo been: (a) to forge the institutions and loyalties necessary to Vietnam’s survival as an independent nation, and (b) to counter the menace of Hanoi’s subversive • . and aggressive designs—pursued since 1960 by a campaign of widespread guerrilla warfare. In attempting to cope with these problems, the GVN has been hampered by its lack of confidence in and its inability to engage the understanding and support of a considerable portion of ‘ the Vietnamese people—including large segments of the educated classes and the peasantry. In recent weeks these inadequacies and tensions in the South Vietnamese body politic have been further revealed and intensifled. .	.

II.	THE BUDDHIST AFFAIR	.	•	•
2. President Diem, his family, and a large proportion of the top leaders of the regime are Roman Catholics, in a population that is 70 •to 80 percent Buddhist. The regime has clearly accorded preferential treatment to Catholics in its employment practices and has favored the Catholic Church. But there have been no legal restrictions on religious freedom and, until recently, most Buddhists appeared passive in their response to the privileged institutional position occupied by the Catholic . Church. There have, however, been various administrative discriminations against the Buddhists, though thcse may have resulted as much from thoughtlessness or misplaced zeal on the part of minor officials as from conscious GVN policy. These have obviously created an undercurrent of resentment, as is evidenced by the extent and intensity of the recent outbreaks.
..	3. In April 1963, the GVN ordered its provincial officials to enforce
a longstanding but generally ignored edict regulating the public display of religious flags. As it happened, this order was issued just prior to
•	Buddha’s birthday (8 May), a major Buddhist festival, and just after Papal flags had been prominently flown during a series of officially
•	' encouraged celebrations commemorating the 25th anniversary of the ordination of Ngo dinh Thuc, Diem’s brother, the Archbishop of Hue. A protest demonstration developed in Hue on 8 May, which was dispersed by fire from a Civil Guard unit. In the ensuing melee several persons were killed, including some children. The GVN has blamed the deaths on Viet Cong terrorists despite evidence to the contrary, and its subsequent stiff-necked handling of this incident and its aftermath has sparked a national crisis. The Buddhists, hith-

erto disorganized and nonprotesting, have shown considerable cohesion and force—enough to clicit a set of “compromise” agreements from President Diem on 16 Junc. Moreover, thc fact that- thc Buddhist leadcrs have been able to challenge the government opcnly without ' _	evoking serious government retaliation has presumably given them
considerable' confidence.
4.	For the moment, thc Buddhist movement remains under the effective contro! of moderate bonzes who have refused to accept support from or countenance cooperation with any of Diem’s political ' opponents, Communist or non-Communist, and appear to be trying to insure that the Buddhists live up to their part of thc bargain. This leadership gave the GVN a period of grace (which expired about the end of June) in which to show that it was moving in good faith to carry out its undertakings, failing which protests would resume. So far. there have been no further demonstrations, but the Buddhist leadership
. •	is clearly restive.
5.	Despite Buddhist restraint in the political exploitation of the affair, it has obvious political overtones. It has apparently aroused widespread popular indignation and could well become a focal point of general disaffection with the Diem government. It provides an issue on which most of Diem’s non-Communist opponents (even including • some Catholics) can .find common ground of agreement. There is con-siderable evidence that the issue itself and, even more, the Diem family's handling of it to date has occasioned restiveness at virtually all levels of the GVN’s military and civil establishments, both of whose lower and middle echelons are largely staffed by Buddhists. In some cases, civil servants seem to have ignored or tempcred GVN instructions, superiors have on occasion evaded their assigned task 'of propounding the official GVN line to their subordinates, and information on impend-ing government actions has obviously leaked to Buddhist leaders. In any case, recent developments are causing many GVN otHcials to reexamine their relations with and tho limits of their loyalty to the Diem . regime; there is accumulating evidence of serious disaffection and coup plotting in high military and civilian circles.
6.	The Buddhist affair appears to have given considerable heart to the various non-Communist political opposition splinter groups in and .... ' ..	. 'out of South Vietnam. There also appears to be a growing feeling
,among former supporters of the regime that Diem’s position may have been permanently and dangerously impaired. Thus far, however, we have no evidence that the diverse opposition groups have been able to form hew or effective alliances with one another.
....	.7.. The Buddhist issue would appear to be an obvious windfall for
the Communists, but so far there is no evidence that they have bccn

SECRET	:
able to exploit it effectively. They* may have pcnetratcd the Buddhist clergy to some extent, but are not presently exerting any discernible influence, despite the suggestions to the contrary in GVN pronouncements. To date the Buddhist crisis docs not appear to have had any appreciable effect on the continuing counterinsurgency effort, though the morale and efficiency of the GVN’s military and civil forces are likely to be impaired if the issue is prolonged.
8. The Buddhist crisis has also hurt thc GVN internationally, with potentially important effects upon the future success of US policy towards southeast Asia. Protests are growing in other predominantly
' Buddhist countries, with the implication that US action could help resolve the crisis. Cambodia and Ceylon have made representations
. to the UN and more may'be forthcoming. In other countries, includ-
•	■ ing the US, the crisis has given new stimuIus to criticism of US policy
•	' on the grounds that the US is supporting an oppressive and unrepresentative regime.	.
9. The future course of the Buddhist affair will be largely determined by the GVN’s actions in the near term. It is likely that the issues recently raised can be resolved if thc GVN executes its portion of the negotiated bargain. However, politically sophisticated segments of South Vietnamese socicty, Buddhists included, are mindful of Diem’s
4	past practice of often using negotiations as a stall for time and of
making promises in ordcr to weather an immediate crisis. The real
• danger in the present situation is that Diem may be tempted to employ such tactics which have served him well in the past but could prove disastrous if essayed this time. If demonstrations should be resumed, they would probably assume an increasingly political cast, and less-moderate Buddhist leadership would bc likely to come to the fore. PubIic ordcr would be threatened. In particular, we cannot be sure how various army or police units v.rould react if ordered to ftre on demon- • strations headed by Buddhist bonzes.
■ III. THE EFFECT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON US-GVN RELATIONS
•	10. The GVN has always shown some concern over thc implications
of US involvement in South Vietnamese affairs and from time to. tune
. has felt moved to restrict US activities and presence in South Vietnam. This attitude springs partly from legitimate, if hypersensitive, concern
• , . .. for the appearance as well as the fact of Vietnam’s recently acquired sovereignty. To a considerable degree, however, it springs from the Diem government’s suspicion of US intentions toward it, and from its
■	belief that the extensive US presence is setting in motion political
forces which could eventually threaten Diem’s political primacy.
11.	Thc Buddhist affairs erupted at one of these periods of GVN sensi-■ tivity, and the strain lias becn aggravated by subsequent events. The
• .

GVN’s initial handling of thc issue gave the US ground for serious em-barrassment and concern which, in turn, produced a succession of forceful US demarches. The Diem family has bitterly resented these US actions and may well feel that thc Buddhist protests were at least indirectly due to tHe US presence. Under the circumstances, further pres-...	. • .sure to reduce that presence is likely.
:	'	I
12.	A key role in this regard will be played by Diem’s brother, Ngo dinh Nhu. He has always been Diem’s chief political lieutenant, but the years since 1954 have witnessed a steady accretion of Nhu’s personal power and authority—an accretion due partly to circumstance and primarily to deliberate eft or t on Nhu’s part. Nhu has political ambitions of his own and almost certainly envisages himself as his brother’s suc-cessor. For a variety of reasons, Nhu has long privately viewed thc US with some hostility and suspicion. American criticism of the GVN has especially irritated Nhu, for he is aware that he and his wife are often its primary targets. Above all, Nhu almost certainly doubts • •	whether the support which the US has given to his brother would be
• transferred to him.
13.	In the negotiations with the Buddhists, Nhu urged his brother to take a firm line and is, by his own statement, wholly out of sympathy with the concessions made. On the basis of past performance, we think it unlikely that he will help to implement the settlement; his influence ■ on- Diem will be rather in the direction of delaying and hedging on commitments, a tendency to which Diem himself is already disposed. This will be the more likely since not only the Nhus and Diem, but also his brothers Archbishop Thuc and Ngo dinh Can, the political boss of the central provinces, obviously continue to doubt the legitimacy of Buddhist complaints and to underestimate the intensity of the crisis.
IV. THE OUTLOOK
14.	If the Dicm government moves effectively to fulfil its 16 June commitments, much of the resentment aroused by the Buddhist controversy could be allayed. However, even if relations between the GVN • and the Buddhists are smoothed over, the general discontent with the Diem regime which the crisis has exacerbated and brought to the fore is likely to persist. Further, if—as is probable—the regime is dilatory, inept, and insincere in handling Buddhist matters, there will probably .be renewed demonstrations, and South Vietnam will probably remain in a state of domestic political tension. Under these circumstances, ' the chances of a non-Communist assassination or coup attempt against Diem will be better than even. We cannot exclude the possibility of an attempted Communist coup, but a Communist attempt v/ill have appreciably less likelihood of success so long as the majority of thc government’s opponents and critics remain—as they are now—alert to the Communist peril. ■

15.	The chances of a non-Communist coup—and of its success—would become greater in the event renewed GVN/Buddhist confrontation should lead to large-scale demonstrations in Saigon. More or less prolonged riot and general disorder would probably result—■ ith the security forces .	confused over which side to support. Under • such circumstances, a
small group, particularly one with prior contingency plans for such an eventuality, might prove able to topple the government. Conversely, a continued or resumed truce between the GVN and thc Buddhists would serve to reduce the likelihood of such an overthrow.
■ ' 16. Any attempt to remove Diem will almost certainly bc directed against Nhu as well, but should Nhu survive Diem, we are virtually certain that he would attempt to gain power—in the first instance prob-• • ably by manipulating thc constitutional machinery. We do not believe that Nhu’s bid would succced, despite the personal political base he has .	sought to build through the Republican Youth (of which he is the overt,
uniformed head), the strategic hamlet program (whose directing Inter-ministerial Committee he chairs), and in thc army. Fie and his wife have become too much the living symbols of all that is disliked in the present regime for Nhu’s personal political power to Iong outlive his brother. There might be a struggle with no little violence, but enough of the army would almost certainly move to take charge of the situation, . either rallying behind thc constitutional successor to install Vice President Tho or backing another non-Communist civil leader or a military ‘ junta.
17. A non-Communist successor regime might prove no more effective than Diem in fighting the Viet Cong; indeed at least initially it mightwell prove considerably less effective, and the counterinsurgency effort would probably be temporarily disrupted. However, there is a reasonably large pool of under-utilized but experienced and trained manpower not only within the military and civilian sectors of the present government but also, to some extent, outside. These elements, given continued support from the US, could provide reasonably effective leadership for the government and the war effort.

It is now clear that whether military proposed martial law or whether Nhu tricked them into it, Nhu took advantage of its imposition to smash pagodas with police and Tung's Special Forces loyal to him, thus placing onus on military in eyes of world and Vietnamese people. Also clear that Nhu has maneuvered himself into commanding position.
i
US Government cannot tolerate situation in which power lies in Nhu’s hands. Diem must be given chance to rid himself of Nhu and his coterie and replace them with best military and political personalities available.
If, in spite of all of your efforts, Diem remains obdurate and refuses, then we must face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved.
we now believe immediate action must be taken to prevent Nhu from consolidating his position further. Therefore, unless you in consultation with Harkins perceive overriding objections you are authorized to proceed along following lines:
(1)	First, we must press on appropriate levels of GVN following line:
(a)	USG cannot accept actions against Buddhists taken by Nhu and his collaborators under cover martial law.
(b)	Prompt dramatic actions redress situation must be taken, including repeal of decree 10, release of arrested monks, nuns, etc.
(2)	we must at same time also tell key military leaders that US would find it impossible to continue support GVN militarily and economically unless above steps are taken immediately which we recognize requires removal of Nhus from the scene, we wish give Diem reasonable opportunity to remove Nhus, but if he remains obdurate, then we are prepared to accept the obvious implication that we can no longer support Diem. You may also tell appropriate military commanders we will give them direct support in any interim period of breakdown central government mechanism.
(3)	we recognize the necessity of removing taint on military for pagoda raids and placing blame squarely on .Nhu. You are authorized to have such statements made in Saigon as you consider desirable to achieve this objective, we are prepared to take same line here and to have Voice of America make statement along lines contained in next numbered telegram whenever you give the word, preferably as soon as possible.
Concurrently, with above, Ambassador and country team should urgently examine al 1 possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem’s replacement if this should become necessary. •
Assume you will consult with General Harkins re any precautions necessary protect American personnel during crisis period.
You will understand that we cannot from washington give you detailed instructions as to how this operation should proceed, but you will also know we will back you to the hilt on actions you take to achieve our objectives.

STATE TO LODGE AND HARKINS
1.	Highest level meeting noon today reviewed your 375 and reaffirmed basic course. Specific decisions follow:
2.	In response to your recommendation, General Harkins is hereby authorized to repeat to such Generals as you indicate the messages previously transmitted by CAS officers. He should stress that the USG supports the movement to eliminate the Nhus from the government, but that before arriving at specific understandings with the Generals, General Harkins must know who are involved, resources available to them and overall plan for coup. The USG will support a coup which has good chance of succeeding but plans no direct involvement of U.S. armed forces. Harkins should state that he is prepared to establish liaison with the coup planners and to review plans, but will not engage directly in joint coup planning.
3.	Question of last approach to Diem remains undecided and separate personal message from Secretary to you develops our concern and asks your comment.
4.	On movement of U.S. forces, we do not expect to make any announcement or leak at present and believe that any later decision to publicize such movements should be closely connected to developing events on your side, we cannot of course prevent unauthorized disclosures or speculation, but we will in any event knock down any reports of evacuation.
5.	You are hereby authorized to announce suspension of aid through Diem government at a time and under conditions of your choice. In deciding upon the use of this authority, you should consider importance of timing and managing announcement so as to minimize appearance of collusion with Generals and also to minimize danger of unpredictable and disruptive reaction by existing government, we also assume that you will not in fact use this authority unless you think it essential, and we see it as possible that Harkins’ approach and increasing process of cooperation may provide assurance Generals desire. Our own view is that it will be best to hold this authority for use in close conjunction with coup, and not for present encouragement of Generals, but decision is yours.

STATE 279	“ (REF: Saigon 375 - TAB B)
29 Aug 1963 STATE TO LODGE
Deeply appreciate your 375 which was a most helpful clarification, we fully understand enormous stakes at issue and the heavy responsibilities which you and Harkins will be carrying in the days ahead and we want to do everything possible from our end to help.
Purpose of this message is to explore further question of possible attempt to separate Diem and the Nhus. In your telegram you appear to treat Diem and the Nhus as a single package whereas we had indicated earlier to the Generals that if the Nhus were removed the question of retaining Diem would be up to them. My own personal assessment is (and this is not an instruction) that the Nhus are by all odds the greater part of the problem in Vietnam, internally, internationally and for American public opinion. Perhaps it is inconceivable that the Nhus could be removed without taking Diem with them or without Diem's abandoning his post. In any event, I would appreciate your comment on whether any distinction can or should be drawn as between Diem and Counsellor and Madame Nhu.
The only point on which you and General Harkins have different views is whether an attempt should be made with Diem to eliminate the Nhus and presumably take other steps to consolidate the country behind a winning effort against the Viet Cong. My own hunch, based in part on the report of Kattenburg’s conversations with Diem is that such an approach could not succeed if it were cast purely in terms of persuasion. Unless such a talk included a real sanction, such as a threatened withdrawal of our support, it is unlikely that it would be taken completely seriously by a man who may feel that we are inescapably committed to an anti-Communi st Vietnam. But if a sanction were used in such a conversation, there would be a high risk that this would be taken by Diem as a sign that action against him and the Nhus was imminent and he might as a minimum move against the Generals or even take some quite fantastic action such as calling on North Vietnam for assistance in expelling the Americans.
It occurs to me, therefore, that if such an approach were to be made it might properly await the time when others were ready to move immediately to constitute a new government. If this be so, the question then arises as to whether an approach to insist upon the expulsion of the Nhus should come from . Americans rather than from the Generals themselves. This might be the means by which the Generals could indicate that they were prepared to disti :guish between Diem and the Nhus. In any event, were the Generals to take tais action it would tend to protect succeeding Vietnam administrations from the charge of being wholly American puppets subjected to whatever anti-American sentiment is inherent in so complex a situation.
I would be glad to have your further thoughts on these points as well as your views on whether further talks with Diem are contemplated to continue your opening discussions with him. You will have received formal instructions on other matters through other messages. Good luck.

the international situation - such as problems affecting Cambodia -and to improve the Vietnamese position wherein U.S. public opinion is concerned. He then said that he is reluctant to start off by saying now that Nhu has to go; that it is unrealistic.
3.	Mr. McNamara stated that he favored the above proposals of the Secretary of State, with one additional step - that is to establish quickly and firmly our line of communication between Lodge, Harkins and the GVN. He pointed out that at the moment our channels of communication are essentially broken and that they should be reinstituted at all costs.
4.	Mr. Rusk added that we must do our best not to permit Diem to decapitate his military command in light of its obviously adverse effect on the prosecution of the war. At this point he asked if anyone present had any doubt in his mind but that the coup was off.
■	5. Mr. Kattenburg said that he had some remaining doubt; that
we have not yet sent the generals a strong enough message; that the BOA statement regarding the withdrawal of aid was most important, but that we repudiated it too soon. He stated further that the group • should take note of the fact that General Harkins did not carry out his instructions with respect to communication with the generals. Mr. Rusk interrupted Kattenburg to state that, to the contrary, he believed Harkins' conduct was exactly correct in light of the initial
•	response which he received from General Kheim (they were refer-
ring to Harkins' report in MACV 1583).
6.	Mr. Hilsman commented that, in his view, the generals are not now going to move unless they are pressed by a revolt from below. In this connection Ambassador Nolting warned that in the uncoordinated Vietnamese structure anything can happen, and that while an organized successful coup is out, there might be small flurries by irresponsible dissidents at any time.
7.	Mr. Hilsman undertook to present four basic factors which . bear directly on the problem confronting the U.S. now. They are, in his view:
a.	The mood of the people, particularly the middle level officers, non-commissioned officers and middle level bureaucrats, who are most restive. Mr. McNamara interrupted to
541

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 201 I
state that he had seen no evidence of this and General Taylor commented that he had seen none either, but would like to see such evidence as Hilsman could produce. Mr. Kattenburg commented that the middle level officers and bureaucrats are uniformly critical of the government, to which Mr. McNamara commented that if this is indeed the fact we should know about it.
b.	The second basic factor, as outlined by Hilsman, was what effect will be felt on our programs elsewhere in Asia if we acquiesce to a strong Nhu-dominated government. In this connection, he reported that there is a Korean study now underway on just how much repression the United States will tolerate before pulling out her aid. Mr. McNamara stated that he had not seen this study and would be anxious to have it.
c.	The third basic factor is Mr. Nhu, his personality and his policy. Hilsman recalled that Nhu has once already launched an effort aimed at withdrawal of our province advisors and stated that he is sure he is in conversation with the French. He gave, as supporting evidence, the content of an intercepted message, which Mr. Bundy asked to see. Ambassador Nolting expressed the opinion that Nhu will not make a deal with Ho Chi Minh on Ho's terms.
d.	The fourth point is the matter of U.S. and world opinion, Hilsman stated that this problem was moving to a political and diplomatic plane. Part of the problem, he said, is the press, which concludes incorrectly that we have the ability to change the things in Vietnam of which they are critical. To this Mr. Murrow added that this problem of press condemnation is now worldwide.
8.	Mr. Kattenburg stated that as recently as last Thursday it was the belief of Ambassador Lodge that, if we undertake to live with this repressive regime, with its bayonets at every street corner and its transparent negotiations with puppet bonzes, we are going to be thrown out of the country in six months. He stated that at this juncture it would be better for us to make the decision to get out honorably. He went on to say that, having been acquainted with Diem for ten years, he was deeply disappointed in him, saying that he will not separate from his brother. It was Kattenburg's view that Diem will get very little support frcm the military and, as time goes on, he will get less and less support and the country will go steadily down hill.

9.	General Taylor asked what Kattenburg meant when he said that we would be forced out of Vietnam within six months. Kattenburg replied that in from six months to a year, as the people see we are losing the war, they will gradually go to the other side and we will be obliged to leave. Ambassador Nolting expressed general disagreement with Mr. Kattenburg. He said that the unfavorable activity which motivated Kattenburg's remarks was confined to the city and, while city support of Diem is doubtless less now, it is not greatly so. He said that it is improper to overlook the fact that we have done a tremendous job toward winning the Vietnam war, working with this same imperfect, annoying government.
10.	Mr. Kattenburg added that there is one new factor - the population, which was in high hopes of expelling the Nhus after the VOA announcement regarding cessation of aid; now, under the heel of Nhu’s military repression, they would quickly lose heart.
11.	Secretary Rusk commented that Kattenburg*s recital was largely speculative; that it would be far better for us to start on the firm basis of two things - that we will not pull out of Vietnam until the war is won, and that we will not run a coup. Mr. McNamara expressed agreement with this view.
12.	Mr. Rusk then said that we should present questions to Lodge which fall within these parameters. He added that he believes we have good proof that we have been winning the war, particularly the contrast between the first six months of 1962 and the first six months of 1963. He then asked the Vice President if he had any contribution to make.
13.	The Vice President stated that he agreed with Secretary Rusk’s conclusions completely; that he had great reservations himself with respect to a coup, particularly so because he had never really seen a genuine alternative to Diem. He stated that from both a practical and a political viewpoint, it would be a disaster to pull out; that we should stop playing cops and robbers and get back to talking straight to the
• GVN, and that we should once again go about winning the war. He stated that after our communications with them are genuinely reestab lished, it may be necessary for someone to talk rough to them -perhaps General Taylor. He said further that he had been greatly impressed with Ambassador Nolting's views and agreed with Mr. McNamara's conclusions.

1.	Highest level meeting today has approved broad outline of an action proposals program designed to obtain from GVN, if possible, reforms and changes in personnel necessary to maintain support of Vietnamese and US opinion in war against Viet Cong. This cable reports this program and our thinking for your comment before a final decision. Your comment requested soonest.
2.	we see no good opportunity for action to remove present government in immediate future; therefore, as your most recent messages suggest, we must

for the present apply such pressures as are available to secure whatever modest improvements on the scene may be possible, we think it likely that ■ such improvements can make a difference, at least in the short run. Such a course, moreover, is consistent with more drastic effort as and when means become available, and we will be in touch on other channels on this problem.
3-	we share view in your 523 that best available reinforcement to your bargaining position in this interim period is clear evidence that all U.S. assistance is granted only on your say-so. Separate telegram discusses details of this problem, but in this message we specifically authorize you to apply any controls you think helpful for this purpose. You are authorized to delay any delivery of supplies or transfer of funds by any agency until you are satisfied that delivery is in U.S. interest, bearing in mind that it is not our current policy to cut off aid, entirely. In other words, we share your view that it will be helpful for GVN to understand that your personal approval is a necessary part of all U.S. assistance, we think it may be particularly desirable for you to use this authority in limiting or rerouting any and all forms of assistance and support which now go to or through Nhu or individuals like Tung who are associated with him. This authorization specifically includes aid actions currently held in abeyance and you are authorized to set those in train or hold them up further in your discretion, we leave entirely in your hands decisions on the degree of privacy or publicity you wish to give to this process.
4.	Subject to your comment and amendment our own list of possible helpful action by government runs as follows in approximate order of importance:
A.	Clear the air — Diem should get everyone back to work and get them to focus on winning the war. He should be broadminded and compassionate in his attitude toward those who have, for understandable reasons, found it difficult under recent circumstances fully to support him. A real spirit of reconciliation could work wonders on the people he leads; a punitive, harsh or autocratic attitude could only lead to further resistance.
B.	Buddhists and students — Let them out and leave them unmolested. This more than anything else would demonstrate the return of a better day and the refocusing on the main job at hand, the war.
C.	Press: The press should be allowed full latitude of expression. Diem will be criticized, but leniency and cooperation with the domestic and foreign press at this time would bring praise for his leadership in due course, while tendentious reporting is irritating, suppression of news leads to much more serious trouble.
D.	Secret and combat police — Confine its role to operations against the VC and abandon operations against non-Communist opposition groups thereby indicating clearly that a period of reconciliation and political stability has returned.
E.	Cabinet changes to inject new untainted blood, remove targets of popular discontent.	•
F.	Elections -- These should be held, should be free, and should be widely observed.
G.	Assembly -- Assembly should be convoked soon after the elections. The government should submit its policies to it and should receive its confidence. An assembly resolution would be most useful for external image purposes.
H.	Party — Can Lao party should not be covert or semi- covert but a broad association of supporters engaged in a common, winning cause.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
m	; 't ■
This could perhaps be best accomplished by disbanding the party and starting afresh.
I.	Repeal or suitable amendment Decree 10.
; J. Rehabilitation by ARVN of pagodas.
K.	Establishment of Ministry of Religious Affairs.
L.	Liberation of passport issuances and currency restrictions enabling al 1 to leave who wish to.
M.	Acceptance of Buddhist Inquiry Mission from world Federation to report true facts of situation to world.
5.	You may wish to add or subtract from the above list, but need to set psychological tone and image is paramount. Diem has taken positive actions in past of greater or less scope than those listed, but they have had little practical political effect since they were carried out in such a way as to make them hollow or, even if real, unbelievable (e.g., martial law already nominally lifted, Assembly elections scheduled, and puppet bonzes established).
6.	Specific "reforms" are apt to have little impact without dramatic, symbolic move which convinces Vietnamese that reforms are real. As practical matter we share your view that this can best be achieved by some visible reduction in influence of Nhus, who are symbol to disaffected of all that they dislike in GVN. This we think would require Nhus departure from Saigon and preferably Vietnam at least for extended vacation, we recognize the strong possibility that these and other pressures may not produce this result, but we are convinced that it is necessary to try.
7.	In washington, in this phase, we would plan to maintain a posture of disapproval of recent GVN actions, but we would not expect to make public our specific requests of Diem. Your comment on public aspects of this phase is particularly needed.
■ '
8.	we note your reluctance to continue dialogue with Diem until you have more to say, but we continue to believe that discussions with him are at a minimum an important source of intelligence and may conceivably be a means of exerting some persuasive effect even in his present state of mind. If you believe that full control of U.S. assistance provides you with means of resuming dialogue, we hope you will do so. we ourselves can see much virtue in effort to reason even with an unreasonable man when he is on a collision course, we repeat, however, that this is a matter for your judgment.
9.	Meanwhile, there is increasing concern here with strictly military aspects of the problem, both in terms of actual progress of operations and of need to make effective case with Congress for continued prosecution of the effort. To meet these needs, President has decided to send Secretary of Defense and General Taylor to Vietnam, arriving early next week. It will be emphasized here that it is a military mission and that all political decisions are being handled through you as President's Senior Representative. •
10.	We repeat that political program outlined above awaits your comment before final decision. President particularly emphasizes that it is fully open to your criticism and amendment. It is obviously an interim plan and further decisions may become necessary very soon.

STATE 431	.
.	18 September 1963
FROM THE PRESIDENT TO LODGE
•	I appreciate your prompt comment and I quite understand the problem you
see in visit of McNamara and Taylor. At the same time my need for this visit is very great indeed, and I believe we can work out an arrangement which takes care of your basic concerns, will you let me have your comment on the following as soon as possible:
1.	we can make it clear here, and McNamara and Taylor can make it clear in Saigon to the GVN, that this visit is not designed to bring comfort to Diem. My own thought is “that in any visit McNamara makes to Diem he will want to speak some home truths on the military consequences of the current difficulties, and also to make it clear that the United States Government is not open to oriental divisive tactics.
2.	we can readily set up this visit as one which you and I have decided on together, or even one which is sent in response to your own concern about winning the war in the current situation. For example, we could announce that the purpose of the mission is to consider with you the practical ways •	and means of carrying out my announced policy that we will support activities
•	which will further the war effort in South Vietnam and avoid supporting activities
which do not. The whole cast of the visit will be that of military consultation with you on the execution of the policy which you and I have determined.
3.	As our last message said, my own central concern in sending this mission is to make sure that my senior military advisors are equipped with a solid on-the-spot understanding of the situation, as a basis both for their participation in our councils here, and for the Administrations accounting to the Congress on this critically important contest with the Communists. Having grown up in an Ambassador's house, I am well trained in the importance of protecting the effectiveness of the man on-the-spot, and I want to handle this particular visit in a way which contributes to and does not detract from your own responsibilities. But in the tough weeks which I see ahead, I just do not see any substitute for the ammunition I will- get from an on-the-spot and authoritative military appraisal.
■	4. I do not think I can delay announcement of the McNamara mission beyond
Saturday, and I will be grateful for a further prompt comment on this message so that we can be firmly together on the best possible handling of the announcement and of the mission itself.

SAIGON 544 (Ref White House Msg CAP 63516 atchd at Wash Guidance TAB)
FROM LODGE TO STATE FOR PRESIDENT ONLY
1. Agree that no good opportunity for action government in immeJiute future is apparent and that
to we
C otP 1963
remove present should, thcrcfore
do whatever we can as an interim measure pending such an eventuality.
2.	Virtually all the topics under paragraph U, letters A to Mf have1’ been-taken up with Dicm and’Nhu at one time or another, most of them by me ’ personally. They think that most of them would either involve destroying the political structure cn which they rest or loss of facc or both, Re, therefore, could not realistically hope for more than lip service. Frankly, I see no opportunity at all for substantive changes. Detailed comments on items A to M are contained in separate telegram.
3.	There are signs that Diem-Nhu are somewhat bothered by my silence. According to one well placed source, they are guessing and off-balance and "desperately anxious" to knot/ what U.S. posture is to be. They ray be preparing sane kind cf a public relations package, possibly to be opened after the elections. I believc th.lt for me to press Dien onthings which are not
in the cards and to a little shrill and with Nhu last night main points of your
repeat what wc have said several times already would be would make us look weak, particularly in view of my talk at a dinner where I had a golden opportunity to make the CAP 63516 as reported in 5U1,
4, Also, I doubt that a public relations package will meet needs of situation which seems particularly grave to me, notably in the light of General Big Minh’s opinion expressed very privately yesterday that the Viet Cong are steadily gaining in strength; have more of the population on their side than has the GVN; that arrests are continuing and that the prisons are full; that more and more students are going over to the Viet Cong; that there is great graft and corruption in the Vietnamese administration of our aid; and that the "Heart of the Amy is not in the war". All this by Vietnamese No. 1 Cencral is now echoed by Secretary of Defense Thuan (See my 542), who wants to leave the country.	.
5.
regards your paragraph 3 on withholding of aid, I still hope
that I may be informed of methods, as requested in my 478, September 11, which will enable ns to apply sanctions in a way which will really affect Diem and Nhu without precipitating an economic collapse and without impeding the war effort, We .ire studying this here and have not yet found a solution. If a way to do this were to be found, it would be cne of the greatest discoveries since the enactment of the Marshall Plan in 19U7 because, so far as I know, the U.S, had never yet been able to control any of the very unsatisfactory governments through which we have had to work in our many very success ful attempts to make these countries strong enough to stand alone,
6. I also believe that whatever sanctions we may discover should be directly tied to a promising coup d’etat and should not be applied v/ithout such a coup being in prospect. In this connection, I believe that we should pursue contact with Big Minh and urge him along if he looks like acting, I particularly think that the idea cf supporting a Vietnamese Army independent of the government should be energetically studied.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

7.	I will, of course, give instructions that programs which one can
be effectively hclcl up should be held up and not released without my approval provided that this can be done without serious harmful effect to the people and to the war effort. Technical assistance and (emission) support to . communications support prorrams may be one way. This would be a fly-speck in the present situation and would have no immediate effect, but I hope that U.S. (omission) may get Vietnamese officials into the habit of asking me to release items which are held up and that, over a long period of time, it might create opportunities for us to get little things done.
" 8. But it is not even within the realm of possibility that such a technique could lead them to do anything which causes loss of face or weakening of their political oarganization, In fact, to threaten them with suppression of aid might well defeat our purposes and might make a bad situation very much wcrse.
t	9. There should in any event be no publicity whatever about this pro-
cedure. If it is possible (omission) a program, I intend to (omission).
10,	As regards your paragraph 6 and "dramatic symbolic moves", I really do not think they could understand this even if Thao wanted to, although I have talked about it to Diem, and to Nhu last night (See my 5R1), They have scant comprehension of what it is to appeal to public opinion as they have really no interest in any other opinion than their own, I have repeatedly brought up the question of Nhu’s' departure and have stressed that if he would just stay away until after Christmas, it mi^ht help get the Appropriation Bill through. This seems like a small thing to us but to them it seens tremendous as they are quite sure that the Army would take over if he even stepped out of the country!
11.	Ycur paragraph 8. I have, of course, no objection to seeing Diem at any time that it would be helpful. But I would rather let him sweat for awhile and not go to see him unless I have something really new to bring up, I would much prefer to wait until I find some part of the AID program to hold up in which he is interested and then have him ask me to come and see him. For example, last night’s dinner which I suspect Nhu of stimulating is infinitely bettcr than for me to take the initiative for an appointment and to call at the office. Perhaps r.y silence had something to do with it.

THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WASHINGTON
2 October 1963
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject: Report of McNamara-Taylor Mission to South Vietnam
Your memorandum of 21 September 1963 directed that General Taylor and Secretary McNamara proceed to South Vietnam to appraise the military and para-military effort to defeat the Viet Cong and to consider, in consultation with Ambassador Lodge, related political and social questions. You further directed that, if the prognosis in our judgment was not hopeful, we should present our views of what action must be taken by the South Vietnam Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action..
Accompanied by representatives of the State Department, CIA, and your Staff, we have conducted an intensive program of visits to key operational areas, supplemented by discussions with U.S. officials in all major U.S. Agencies as well as officials of the GVN and third countries.
we have also discussed our findings in detail with Ambassador Lodge, and with General Harkins and Admiral Felt.
The following report is concurred in by the Staff Members of the mission as individuals, subject to the exceptions noted.
I.	CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.	Conclusions.
1.	The military campaign has made great progress and continues to progress.
2.	There are serious political tensions in Saigon(and perhaps elsewhere in South Vietnam) where the Diem-Nhu government is becoming increasingly unpopular.
3.	There is no solid evidence of the possibility of a successful coup, although assassination of Diem or Nhu is always a possibility.
4.	Although some, and perhaps an increasing number, of GVN military officers are becoming hostile to the government, they are more hostile to the Viet Cong than to the government and at least for the near future they will continue to perform their military duties.
5.	Further repressive actions by Diem and Nhu could change the present favorable military trends. On the other hand, a return to more moderate methods of control and administration, unlikely though it may be, would substantially mitigate the political crisis.

NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011
6.	It is 'not clear that pressures exerted by the U.S. will move Diem and Nhu toward moderation. Indeed, pressures may increase their obduracy. But unless such pressures are exerted, they are almost certain to continue past patterns of behavior.
B.	Recommendations.
we recommend that:
1.	General Harkins review with Diem the military changes necessary to complete the military campaign in the Northern and Central areas (I, II, and III Corps) by the end of 1954, and in the Delta (IV Corps) by the end of 1965- This review would consider the need for such changes as:
a.	A further shift of military emphasis and strength to the Delta (IV Corps).
b.	An increase in the military tempo in all corps areas, so that all combat troops are in the Field an average of 20 days out of 30 and static missions are ended.
c.	Emphasis on "clear and hold operations" instead of terrain sweeps which have little permanent value.
d.	The expansion of personnel in combat units to full authorized strength.	.
e.	The training and arming of hamlet militia at an accelerated rate, especially in the Delta•
f.	A consolidation of the strategic hamlet program, especially in the Delta, and action to insure that future strategic hamlets are not built until they can be protected, and until civic action programs can be introduced.
2.	A program be established to train Vietnamese so that essential functions now performed by U.S. military personnel can be carried out by Vietnamese by the end of 1965* It should be possible to withdraw the bulk of U.S. personnel by that time.	-
3.	In accordance with the program to train progressively Vietnamese to take over military functions, the Defense Department should announce in the very near future presently prepared plans to withdraw 1000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963. This action should be explained in low key as an initial step in a long-term program to replace U.S. personnel with trained Vietnamese without impairment of the war effort
4.	The following actions be taken to impress upon Diem our disapproval of his political program.
a.	Continue to withhold commitment of funds in the commoc cy import program, but avoid a formal announcement. The potential significance of the withholding of commitments for the 1964 military budget should be brought home to the top military officers in working level contacts between USOM and MACV and the Joint General Staff; up to now we have stated $95 million may-be used by the Vietnamese as a planning level for the commodity import program for 1164. Henceforth we could make clear that this is uncertain both because of lack of final appropriation action by the Congress and because of executive policy.	•

/0
b.	Suspend approval of the pending AID loans for the Saigon-Cholon waterworks and Saigon Electric Power Project, we should state clearly that we are doing so as a matter of policy.
c.	Advise Diem that MAP and CIA support for designated units, now under Colonel Tung's control (mostly held in or near the Saigon area for political reasons) will be cut off unless these units are promptly assigned to the full authority of the Joint General Staff and transferred to the field.
d.	Maintain the present purely "correct" relations with the top GVN, and specifically between the Ambassador and Diem. Contact between General Harkins and Diem and Defense Secretary Thuan on military matters should not, however, be suspended, as this remains an important channel of advice. USOM and USIA should also seek to maintain contacts where these are needed to push forward programs in support of the effort in the field, while taking care not to cut across the basic picture of U.S. disapproval and uncertainty of U.S. aid intentions, we should work with the Diem government but
not support it.*
As we pursue these courses of action, the situation must be closely watched to see what steps Diem is taking to reduce repressive practices and to improve the effectiveness of the military effort, we should set no fixed criteria, but recognize that we would have to decide in 2 - 4 months whether to move to more drastic action or try to carry on with Diem even if he had not taken significant steps.
5.	At this time, no initiative should be taken to encourage actively a change in government. Our policy should be to seek urgently to identify and build contacts with an alternative leadership if and when it appears.
6.	The following statement be approved as current U.S. policy toward South Vietnam and constitute the substance of the government position to be presented both in Congressional testimony and in public statements.
a.	The security of South Vietnam remains vital to United States security. For this reason, we adhere to the overriding objective of denying this country to Communism and of suppressing the Viet Cong insurgency as promptly as possible. (By suppressing the insurgency we mean reducing it to proportions manageable by the national security forces of the GVN, unassisted by the presence of U.S. military forces.) we believe the U.S. part of the task can be completed by the end of 1965, the terminal date which we are taking as the time objective of our counterinsurgency programs.
b.	The military program in Vietnam has made progress and is sound in principle.
c.	The political situation in Vietnam remains deeply seri ms.
It has not yet significantly affected the military effort, but could do so at some time in the future. If the result is a GVN ineffective in the conduct of the war, the U.S. will review its attitude toward
*Mr. Colby believes that the official "correct" relationship should be supplemented by selected and restricted unofficial and personal relationships with individuals in the GVN, approved by the Ambassador, where persuasion could be fruitful without derogation of the official U.S. posture.

support for the government. Although we are deeply concerned by repressive practices, effective performance in the conduct of the war should be the determining factor in our relations with the GVN.
d.	The U.S. has expressed its disapproval of certain actions of the Diem-Nhu regime and will do so again if required. Our policy is to seek to bring about the abandonment of repression because of its effect on the popular will to resist. Our means consist of expressions of disapproval and the withholding of support from GVN activities that are not clearly contributing to the war effort. We will use these means as required to assure an effective military program.
II.	MILITARY SITUATION AND TRENDS
A.	The Standards of Measure.
The test of the military situation is whether the GVN is succeeding in widening its area of effective control of the population and the countryside. This is difficult to measure, and cannot be stated simply in terms of the number of stragetic hamlets built or the number of roads that can now be travelled without escort. Nor can the overall situation be gauged solely in terms of the extent of GVN offensive action, relative weapon losses and defections, VC strength figures, or other measures of military performance. All of these factors are important and must be taken into account; however, a great deal of judgment is required in their interpretation.
We have looked at these factors carefully, but we have also given .	great weight to the evidence of the men on the spot -- the U.S. military
advisors and the USOM field representatives -- as to whether government control is in fact extending and becoming more accepted and solid in the various areas, we have been greatly impressed with the variation of the situation from area to area and from province to province; there is a different war in each area and province, and an example can be found somewhere to support any attitude toward the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Our task has been to observe the situation as broadly as possible to avoid giving exaggerated importance to any single angle of observation.
B.	Overall Progress.
with allowance for all uncertainties, it is our firm conclusion that the GVN military program has made great progress in the last year and a half, and that this progress has continued at a fairly steady rate in the past six months even through the period of greatest political unrest in Saigon. The tactics and techniques employed by the Vietnamese under U.S. monitor ship are sound and give promise of ultimate victory.
Specifically, progress is most clear in the northern areas (I and II Corps); especially noteworthy work has been done in key coastal provinces where VC strength once threatened to cut the country in half but has now been substantially reduced. In the central area and the highlands (III Corps), progress has been steady though slower, and the situation remains difficult in the provinces to the west and north of Saigon itself.

Throughout the northern two-thirds of the country the strategic hamlet program has matured effectively and freedom of rural movement has grown steadily.
The Delta remains the toughest area of all, and now requires top priority in both GVN and U.S. efforts. Approximately 40% of the people live there; the area is rich and has traditionally resisted central authority; it is the center of Viet Cong strength -- over one-third of the "hard core" are found there; and the maritime nature of the terrain renders it much the most difficult region to pacify.
A first step has just been taken by the move of a third division to the Delta, but further major actions are needed. They include priority decisions by the GVN in the use of its resources, the consolidation rather than further spread of strategic hamlets in many areas, the elimination of many fixed outposts, better hamlet defenses and more trained hamlet militia. Regular army units should be reserved for use in mobile actions and for clear and hold operations in support of the strategic hamlet program. Though there are unresolved problems in several key provinces close to Saigon, as well as in the southernmost parts where the VC are strongly established, it is clear that the Delta situation has generally improved over the past year, even-with the limited resources allocated to it. Despite recent evidences of greater VC effort and better weapons, the Delta campaign can continue to go forward if the essential priority is assigned to Delta requirements.
C.	Military Indicators.
From a more strictly military standpoint, it should be noted that , this overall progress is being achieved against a Viet Cong effort that has not yet been seriously reduced in the aggregate, and that is putting up a formidable fight notably in the Delta and key provinces near Saigon. The military indicators are mixed, reflecting greater and more effective GVN effort but also the continued toughness of the fight.

Recent days have been characterized by reports of greater Viet Cong activity, countrywide, coupled with evidence of improved weaponry in their hands. Some U.S. advisors, as well as some Vietnamese, view this increased activity as a logical, reaction to the steadily growing strategic ham1et: program, which they believe is progressively separating the Viet Cong from the rural population and from their sources of food and reinforcements. Others view it as a delayed effort to capitalize upon the political trouble. All agree that it reflects a continuing capability for offensive actiot
D.	The Strategic Hamlet Program.
In this generally favorable military picture, two main factors F've been the strategic hamlet program and the effectiveness of the U.S. advisory and support effort.
we found unanimous agreement that the strategic hamlet program is sound in concept, and generally effective in execution although it has been overextended in some areas of the Delta. The teamwork of U.S. military men and civilians is generally excellent, and on the GVN side a number of the province chiefs who handled the program poorly in its initial phases have been replaced by men who appear to have a better grasp of the central

' ’ if
purpose of the program — to bring people under clear GVN control, in a way that really solidifies their support of their government and opposition to the VC. The economic and civic action element of the program (schools medicine, fertilizer, etc.) has been carried forward on the U.S. side with considerable effectiveness, but has necessarily lagged behind the physical completion of hamlets and in insecure areas has made little progress, without this element, coupled with effective hamlet defense measures, what are called "strategic hamlets" may be only nominally under GVN control, we were particularly struck by some evidence that a hamlet's readiness to defend itself often bears a direct relation to whether the Province Chief, with U.S. help, has managed to make a convincing start in civic action.
E.	The U.S. Military Advisory and Support Effort.
we may all be proud of the effectiveness of the U.S. military advisory and support effort, with few exceptions, U.S. advisors report excellent relations with their Vietnamese counterparts, whom they characterize as proud and willing soldiers. The stiffening and exemplary effect of U.S. behavior and attitudes has had an impact which is not confined to the war effort, but which extends deeply into the whole Vietnamese way of doing things.
The U.S. advisory effort, however, cannot assure ultimate success. This is a Vietnamese war and the country and the war must, in the end, be run solely by the Vietnamese. It will impair their independence and the development of their initiative if we leave our advisors in place beyond the time they are really needed. In some areas reductions in the U.S. effort and transfer of U.S. responsibilities to the Vietnamese can now be carried out without material impairment of the total war effort. As a start, we believe that a reduction of about 1000 U.S. personnel (for which plans have been in preparation since the spring) can be carried out before the end of 1963* No further reductions should be made until the requirements of the 1964 campaign become firm.
F. Conclusion.
Acknowledging the progress achieved to date, there still remains the question of when the final military victory can be attained. If, by victory, we mean the reduction of the insurgency to something little more than sporadic banditry in outlying districts, it is the view of the vast majority of military commanders consulted that success may be achieved in the I, II and III Corps area by the end of CY 1964. Victory in the IV Corps will take longer — at least well into 1965* These estimates necessarily assume that the political situation does not significantly impede the effort.
III.	ECONOMIC SITUATION AND TRENDS
• The current economic situation in South Vietnam is, in the main, satisfactory. The internal price level is reasonably stable. Commercial inventories are high and national bank reserves of foreign exchange stand at approximately $160 million which equals approximately 11 to 12 months. Imports at current rate ($240 million imports .less $75 to $80 million exports). The effective rate of exchange’of the piastre to the dollar is within the range of reasonable economic value.

Trends are difficult to discuss but the business community was ; optimistic before the present crises. Rice exports for the current calendar year are projected at approximately $80 million against $8,75 . million last year. Total exports are anticipated at $70 million as against $55 million last year. Banking circles point to one bearish factor in the export picture. Rubber, which represents more than half in value of all exports, faces a situation of declining world market prices and some plantations may curtail operations in the next year.
On the domestic side South Vietnam is almost self-sufficient in cotton testiles and is on its way to satisfying its own fertilizer and cement requirements by 1966. At the beginning of the current year banking circles noted a healthy increase in local investments in small enterprises which reflects, in their judgment an increase of confidence in the future that is unusual for recent years. The prospects for next year, under normal circumstances, appear reasonably good. If the Government encourages diversification in agriculture, exports of such products together with the increasing availability of rice should offset the decline in foreign exchange earnings from rubber.
The projected GVN budget for CY 1964 totals F27 billion: tax revenues
• are estimated at Pll billion, leaving an internal budget deficit of P16 billion. External resources (resulting from U.S. operations but requiring also use of foreign exchange reserves) are estimated to generate an additional P9.5 billion, leaving a P6.5 billion estimated deficit. This
■ deficit might be somewhat reduced by additional tax revenues. To meet the remaining deficit, borrowings from the National Bank would still be required with a resulting increase in the money supply.
The money supply has been increasing rather sharply in the last nine months, although the inflationary effect has been dampened by the recent arrival of large shipments under USOM's commodity import program. This has been accompanied by an increase in import licensing brought about principally by the GVN's adoption at the beginning of this year of an open general licensing system for certain manufactured goods such as trucks, automobiles, fabricated steel and some industrial raw materials. The banks estimate that the open general licensing system will result in a $10 million increase in GVN-financed imports in CY 1963.
In short, while the general economic situation is good, the prospects for holding the line on inflation and the balance of payments do not appear bright for CY 1964 unless the GVN can be persuaded to impose severe restraints.
Effect of the Political Crisis on the Economic Situation.
At the present time the current political problems have not had a significant effect on the internal economic situation. French banking sources report a slight increase in the rate of withdrawals from private . Vietnamese bank deposits over the last two months; but this increase has only been on the order of 1 to 2 percent.
Commercial inventory stocks seem to be increasing, but this can be explained by the recent increase in arrivals of foreign goods. In any case prices have remained stable with exception of a slight increase in the cost of cement, automobiles and certain industrial equipment.

WSWI
The value of the piastre has fallen 10^ on the Hong Kong market in the last month. Virtually no abnormal flight of capital has yet been observed in banking circles.
The most apparent effect of the crisis of the past several weeks is a slowdown in investment decisions, both in industry and in the limited capital market. Inventors and industrialists are worried about a reduction in U.S. aid. They are aware of the suspension in the issuances of procurement authorizations and are therefore concerned about the availability of imported raw materials and spare parts.
Since the Saigon business community has lived through some violent times before this, they have not reacted to events with as much panic as might have been expected. If the U.S. should long suspend import commitments, however, it should be apparent that the private sector of the economy will react in an inflationary manner.

IV. POLITICAL SITUATION AND TRENDS
Although our observations of the political situation were necessarily less extensive than of the military picture, they were ample to confirm that the existing situation is one of high tension, we reviewed the situation carefully with the relevant U.S. officials and were also impressed by frank interviews with GVN officials and with third country representatives.
In essence, discontent with the Diem/Nhu regime, which had been widespread just below the surface during recent years, has now become a seething problem. The Buddhist and student crises have precipitated these discontents and given them specific issues. But the problem goes deeply into the personalties, objectives, and methods of operation of Diem and Nhu over a Long period.
The evidence appears overwhelming that Diem and Nhu operate in close collaboration, and that each needs the other. They undoubtedly regard themselves as carrying out a social and political revolution for the good of their country, using all means -- including the strategic hamlet program — to build up a secure base of political strength in the rural areas.	.
At the same time, the positive and educative sides of their actions, aimed primarily at the countryside, but with extensive countrywide educational efforts as well, have been increasingly matched by negative and repressive measures of control against the urban population. The urban elite or "Establishment" — which includes intellectuals, civilian officials at all levels, and a high proportion of military officers -- has never been trusted by Diem and Nhu. Always sensitive to signs of opposition — with some justification from events in 1954-55' and the attempted coups of 1960 and 1962 -- the regime has turned increasingly to police methods, particularly secret arrests, that have almost all the bad effects of outright totalitarianism even though a good deal of freedom to criticize still remains.
Concurrently, the palace has always manipulated and controlled the government structure to ensure its own control. The degree to which centralized control and intervention have been carried, and the often quixotic nature of its use, have had a steadily growing adverse effect on efficiency and morale.	t
♦
Both of these adverse characteristics of the regime, and the resentment of. them, focus more and more on Nhu. Not merely is he the hatchet man, but his statements on "personalism" and his building up with Madame Nhu of a wide personal apparatus have smacked more and more of outright totalitarianism. A. further distrubing feature of Nhu is his flirtation with the idea of negotiating with North Vietnam,

direction, to establish necessary contacts to allow U.S. to continuously appraise coup prospects.
If and when we have a better picture, the choice will still remain difficult whether we would prefer to take our chances on a spontaneous coup (assuming some action by Diem and Nhu would trigger it) or to risk U.S. prestige and having the U.S. hand show with a coup group which appeared likely to be a better alternative government. Any regime that was identified from the outset as a U.S. "puppet" would have disadvantages both within South Vietnam and in significant areas of the world, including other underdeveloped nations where the U.S. has a major role.
In any case, whether or not it proves to be wise to promote a coup at a later time, we must be ready for the possibility of a spontaneous coup, and this too requires clandestine contacts on an intensive basis.
IX. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVE POLICIES
Broadly speaking, we believe there are three alternative policies the U.S. could pursue to achieve its political and military objectives:
1.	Return to avowed support of the Diem regime and attempt to obtain the necessary improvements through persuasion from a posture of "reconciliation." This would not mean any expression of approval of the repressive actions of the regime, but simply that we would go back in practice to business as usual.
2.	Follow a policy of selective pressures: "purely correct" relationships at the top official level, continuing to withhold further • actions in the commodity import program, and making clear our disapproval of the regime. A further element in this policy is letting the present impression stand that the U.S. would not be averse to a change of Government -- although we would not take any immediate actions to initiate a coup.
3.	Start immediately to promote a coup by high ranking military officers. This policy might involve more extended suspensions of aid and sharp denounciations of the regime's actions so timed as to fit with coup prospects and planning.
| Our analysis of these alternatives is as follows:
1.	Reconciliation.
we believe that this course of action would be ineffective from the standpoint of events in South Vietnam alone, and would also greatly increase our difficulties in justifying the present U.S. support effort both to the Congress and generally to significant third nations, we are most unlikely, after recent events, to get Diem to make the necessary changes; on the contrary, he would almost certainly regard
571
Declassified per Executive Order 13526, Section 3.3
NND Project Number: NND 63316. By: NWD Date: 2011

our reconciliation as an evidence that the U.S. would sit still for just about anything he did. The result would probably be not only a continuation of the destructive elements in the Regime's policies but a return to larger scale repressions as and when Diem and Nhu thought they were necessary. The result would probably be sharp deterioration in the military situation in a fairly short period.
2.	Selective Pressures.
we have examined numerous possibilities of applying pressures to Diem in order to incline him to the direction of our policies. The most powerful instrument at our disposal is the control of military and economic aid but any consideration of its use reveals the double-edged nature of its effects. Any long term reduction of aid cannot but have an eventual adverse effect on the military campaign since both the military and the economic programs have been consciously designed and justified in terms of their contribution to the war effort. Hence, immediate reductions must be selected carefully and be left in effect only for short periods.
we believe that the present level of pressures is causing, and will cause, Diem some concern, while at the same time not significantly impairing the military effort, we are not hopeful that this level (or indeed any level) of pressure will actually induce Diem to remove Nhu from the picture completely. However, there is a better chance that Diem will at least be deterred from resuming large scale oppressions.
At the same time, there are various factors that set a time limit to pursuing this course of action in its present form, within 2-4 months we have to make critical decisions with the GVN about its 1964 budget and our economic support level. In addition, there is a significant and growing possibility that even the present limited actions in the economic field — more for psychological than for economic reasons -- would start a wave of speculation and inflation that would be difficult to control or bring back into proper shape. As to when we would reverse our present course, the resumption of the full program of ecot jmic and military aid should be tied to the actions of the Diem government.
As a foundation for the development of our long-term economic and military aid programs, we believe it may be possible to develop specific military objectives to be achieved on an agreed schedule. The extent to which such objectives are met, in conjunction with an evaluation of the regime's political performance, would determine the level of aid for the following period.	•

SAIGON (CAS 1445), 5 October 1963
TO STATE FROM LODGE
1.	Lt. Col. Conein met with Gen Duong Van Minh at Gen. Minh's Headquarters on Le Van Duyet for one hour and ten minutes morning of 5 Oct 63- This meeting was at the initiative of Gen Minh and has been specifically cleared in advance by Ambassador Lodge. No other persons were present. The conversation was conducted in French.
2.	Gen. Minh stated that he must know American Government's position with respect to a change in the Government of Vietnam within the very near future. Gen. Minh added the Generals were aware of the situation is deteriorating rapidly and that action to change the Government must be taken or the war will be lost to the Viet Cong because the Government no longer has the support of the people. Gen. Minh identified among the other Generals participating with him in this plan:
Maj. Gen. Tran Van Don Brig. Gen. Tran Thien Khiem Maj. Gen. Tran Van Kim
3.	Gen. Minh made it clear that he did not expect any specific American support for an effort on the part of himself and his colleagues to change the Government but he stated he does need American assurances that the USG will not rpt not attempt to thwart this plan.
4.	Gen. Minh also stated that he himself has no political ambitions nor do any of the other General Officers except perhaps, he said laughingly, Gen. Ton That Dinh. Gen. Minh insisted that his only purpose is to win the war. He added emphatically that to do this continuation of American Military and Economic Aid at the present level (He said one and one half million dollars per day) is necessary.
5-	Gen. Minh outlined three possible plans for the accomplishment of the change of Government:
a.	Assassination of Ngo Dinh Nhu and Ngo Dinh Can keeping President Diem in Office Gen. Minh said this was the easiest plan to accomplish.
b.	The encirclement of Saigon by various military units particularly the unit at Ben Cat. (Comment: Fifth Division elements commanded by Gen. Dinh).
c.	Direct confrontation between military units involved in the coup and loyalist military units in Saigon. In effect, dividing the city of Saigon into sectors and cleaning it out pocket by pocket. Gen. Minh claims under the circumstances Diem and Nhu could count on the loyalty of 5,500 troops within the city of Saigon.
6. Conein replied to Gen. Minh that he could not answer specific questions as to USG non-interference nor could he give any advice with respect to tactical planning. He added that he could not advise concerning the best of the three plans.

Lodge
Re CAS 1445
1.	Believe CAP 63560 gives general guidance requested REFTEL. We have following additional general thoughts which have been discussed with President, while we do not wish to stimulate coup, we also do not wish to leave impression that U.S. would thwart a change of government or deny economic and military assistance to a new regime if it appeared capable of increasing effectiveness of military effort, ensuring popular support to win war and improving working relations with U.S. We would like to be informed on what is being contemplated but we should avoid being drawn into reviewing or advising on operational plans or any other act which might tend to identify U.S. too closely with change in govern-ment. we would, however, welcome information which would help us assess character of any alternate leadership.
2.	with reference to specific problem of General Minh you should seriously consider having contact take position that in present state his knowledge he is unable present Minh's case to responsible policy officials with any degree of seriousness. In order to get responsible officials even to consider Minh's problem, contact would have to have detailed information clearly indicating that Minh's plans offer a high prospect of success. At present contact sees no such prospect in the information so far provided.	t
3.	You should also consider with Acting Station Chief whether it would be desirable in order to preserve security and deniability in this as well as similar approaches to others whether appropriate arrangements could be made for follow-up contacts by individuals brought in especially from outside Vietnam. As we indicated in CAP 63560 we are most concerned about security problem and we are confining knowledge these sensitive matters in Washington to extremely limited group, high officials in white House, State, Defense and CIA with whom this message cleared.

Third, there are several other important indicators which are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle statistically. These include: morale and efficiency within the bureaucracy and the armed services, the degree of locally acquired or volunteered intelligence, popular attitudes toward the Viet Cong and the government, and the status and impact of the government’s political, social, and economic activities in support of the strategic hamlet program. Nonetheless, statistics touch on some significant aspects of the military situation and provide a guide at least to trends in the fighting.
Viet Cong Incidents
Statistics show that the Viet Cong have accelerated their military and subversive effort since July 1963• From January 1962 until July 1963, the total number of Viet Cong armed attacks, as well as all other incidents (sabotage, terrorism, and propaganda), dropped consistently. However, since July of this year, total incidents and armed attacks have increased appreciably. If the present trend continues through the end of this year, total incidents will exceed by more than 10^ the level for the period July-December 1962. Large Viet Cong attacks (company-size or larger) have also increased appreciably since July of this year, and, if the trend continues, could exceed by almost 30^ the level for July-December 1962.
In addition, the Viet Cong during the last half of 1963 have shown increased daring, planning, and coordination in their attacks. This has been evidenced by an attack against a United States helicopter base, and by simultaneous actions against two or more strategic hamlets and even against two district capitals. Until this period, towns had not been attached since September 1961, when the capital of Phuoc Thanh province was raided by a large Viet Cong force.
Casualties
Although the Viet Cong have incurred relatively heavy losses during some of their more daring recent attacks, their overall casualties since July of this year have not been correspondingly high. If the accelerated Viet Cong effort and losses suffered are maintained at present levels during the rest of this year, casualties will remain about 10^ below the level in July-December 1962, the peak period in Viet Cong casualties last year.
In contrast, casualties among the South Vietnamese military and security forces since July of this year are increasing and, at the present rate, could exceed by about 20$ the level for the preceding six-month period. This would raise the total casualties for 1963 by some 30^ above the 1961 and 1962 levels. Indeed, the ratio of Viet Cong to South Vietnamese forces killed and captured dropped from five-to-one for the last half of 1962 to three-to-one for the period July-September 18, 1963. This ratio would be still less favorable to the government if casualties among such

paramilitary groups as the village militia and Montagnard scouts were taken into account. Casualty statistics on these groups are not complete and are not shown in this report. During the period August-September 18, 1963, however, their casualties exceeded 500 as compared with the combined total of more than 2,300 casualties among the Army, Civil Guard, and Self Defense Corps for the same period.
Weapons Losses
During 1962, weapons losses among both the Viet Cong and government forces increased progressively, although government losses were somewhat greater than those of the Viet Cong. The increase continued during January-April 1963, but losses on both sides were about even. However, during May-August, Viet Cong weapons losses dropped by more than 10^,, while losses among government forces increased by about 15^- If the trend noted during the last three weeks of September should continue throughout the year, the Viet Cong will lose almost 70^ fewer weapons than the govern-ment. Moreover, a large number of the Viet Cong weapons lost are of the home-made variety while the great bulk of government weapons losses are of standard or modern-type pieces.
Defections and Desertions
Viet Cong military defections increased progressively during 1963 until June, dropping from a high of 414 in May to a low of 107 for about the first three weeks of September. (These Viet Cong are usually members of the insurgent armed forces, although only a small percentage are believed to be hard-core cadres. They generally defect to South Vietnamese military forces who interrogate and screen them and determine their disposition.)
In addition to the military defectors, some 13,700 persons "rallied" to the government from April through August 1963 under a national surrender and amnesty campaign. This campaign, known as "Chieu Hoi," was officially inaugurated on April 19- The South Vietnamese government regards the bulk of these as Viet Cong. United States officials, who do not screen these statistics, believe the vast majority to be refugees and persons who, for one reason or another, have left areas controlled or formerly controll d by the Viet Cong. Many of them, however, may well have assisted the V_et Cong in some way voluntarily or under duress. The number of "Chieu Hol" returnees increased progressively from April 19 to June 1963, when a high of about 3,200 was reached. By August, returnees dropped to a low of out 1,600. Complete statistics are not yet available for September.
Until June 1963, statistics on South Vietnamese desertions included all military and security personnel who had been absent from duty without official leave for any reason or for any length of time. Moreover, there was apparently no attempt to adjust these all-inclusive statistics to account for persons who had returned to duty. Including "awols," the 1962 monthly average of deserters was .7^ of the combined strength of the military

and security services. On this-, basis, there was no change in the monthly average during the first five months of 19o3- Beginning in June, however, statistics on deserters excluded orols" altnough they were still not adjusted to cover returnees. Even so, on the new basis, the monthly average of deserters increased from .Cp in June 19-0 5 to .8p in August 1963.
Complete statistics are not yet available for September.
Conclusions
On the basis of available statistical trends, there appear to have been a number of significant and unfavorable changes in the military situation in South Vietnam since July of this year. Indeed, virtually all of the indicators noted in this report suggest that the military position of the Vietnam Government may have reverted to the point it had reached ■ • six F.cs.ths to a year ago. While it is difficult to relate precisely cause and effect for adverse changes in the military situ-ticn in South Vietnam, . their occurrence at a time when the political situation has deteriorated must be considered as mere than coincidental. At the same time, even "ithcut the Buddhist c??isis and. the more serious political difficulties following in its wake, it is possible that the Diem government would have been unable to maintain the favorable trends of preceding periods in the face of the accelerated Viet Cong effort since July 1963.

SAIGON 1964, 25 Oct. 63
FROM LODGE TO McG. BUNDY	.
1.	I appreciate the concern expressed by you in ref. a relative to the Gen. Don/Conein relationship, and also the present lack of firm intelligence on the details of the general’s plot. I hope that ref. b will assist in clearing up some of the doubts relative to general's plans,
• and I am hopeful that the detailed plans promised for two days before the coup attempt will clear up any remaining doubts.
2.	CAS has been punctilious in carrying out my instructions. I have personally approved each meeting between Gen. Don and Conein who has carried out my orders in each instance explicitly, while I share your concern about the continued involvement of Conein in this matter, a suitable substitute for Conein as the principal contact is not presently available. Conein, as you know, is a friend of some eighteen years' standing with Gen. Don, and General Don has expressed extreme reluctance to deal with anyone else. I do not believe the involvement of another American in close contact with the generals would be productive, we are, however, considering the feasibility of a plan for the introduction of an additional officer as a cut-out between Conein and a designee of Gen. Don for communication purposes only. This officer is completely unwitting of any details of past or present coup activities and will remain so.
3.	with reference to Gen. Harkins' comment to Gen. Don which Don reports to have referred to a presidential directive and the proposal for a meeting with me, this may have served the useful purpose of allaying the General's fears as to our interest. If this were a provocation, the GVN could have assumed and manufactured any variations of the same theme. As a precautionary measure, however, I of course refused to see Gen. Don. As to the lack of information as to General Don’s real backing, and the lack of evidence that any real capabilities for action have been developed, ref. b provides only part of the answer. I feel sure that the reluctance of the generals to provide the U.S. with full details of their plans at this time, is a reflection of their own sense of security and a lack of confidence that in the large American community present in Saijon their plans will not be prematurely revealed.
4.	The best evidence available to the Embassy, which I grant you is not as complete as we would like it, is that Gen. Don and the other generals involved with him are seriously attempting to effect a change in the government. I do not believe that this is a provocation by Ngo Dinh Nhu, although we shall continue to assess the planning as well as possible. In the event that the coup aborts, or in the event that Nhu has mastermined a provocation, I believe that our involvement to date through Cone in is still within the realm of plausible denial. CAS is

perfeCtly prepared to have me disavow Concin ar any time it may serve the national interest.
5.	I welcome your reaffirming instructions contained in CAS Washington 7422S. It is vital that we neither thwart a coup nor that \yu are even in a position where we do not know what is going on.
6.	We shouId not thwart a coup for two reasons. First, it seems /	at least an even bet that the next government would not bungle and
t	stumble as much as the prescnt one has. Secondly, it is cxtrcmely
unwise in the long range for us to pour cold water on attempts at a N Coup, particularly when they are just in thcir beginning stages.
W. .should remember that this is the only way in which the people in Vietnam can possibly get a change of government. Whenever we thwse; attempts at a coup, as we have done in the past, wc are incurring very lono lastin" resentments, we are assuming an undue responsibility f c .• keeping the incumbents in office, and in general are setting oarselves in judgment over thc affairs of Vietnam. Merely to keep in toueb, with this situation and a policy merely limited to "not thwarting" arc courses both of which entail some risks but these are lesser risks than cither thwarting all coups while they are stillborn or our not being im'ocmcc cf what is happening. All the above is totally distinct from not wanting U.S. military advisors to bc distracted by matters which are not in their domain, with which I heartily a.gree. But obviously this does not confliot with a policy of not thwarting. In judging propose:, coups, v/e must consider the’effcCt on thc war effort. Certainly- a suecession of fichts for control of thc Government of Vietnam -would inter 'ore with thc war effort. It must also be said that the war effort has been interfered with already by the incompetence of the present government and the uproar which this has caused.
7.	Gcn. Don’s intention, to have no religious discrimination in a future government is commendable and I applaud his desire not to bc "a vassal" of the U.S. But I do not think his promise of a democratic erection is realistic. This country simply is not ready for that procedure. I would, add two other requirements. First, that there be no wholesale purges of personnel in the government. Individuals who were particularly reprehensible could be dealt with later by the regular legal process. Then I would be impractical, but I am thinking of a government which might include Tri Quang and which certainly should include-men of the stature • of Mr. Bun, the labor leader..	,	'	_

1.	Your 2023, 2040, 2041 and 2043 examined, with care at highest levels here. You should promptly discuss this reply and associated, messages with Harkins whose responsibilities toward any coup are very heavy especially after you leave (see para. 7 below). They give much clearer picture group's alleged plans and also indicate chances cf action with or without our approval now so significant that we should urgently consider our attitude and contingency plans, We note particularly Don's curiosity your departure and his insistence Conein be available from Nednesday night on, which suggests date might be as early as Thursday.
2.	Believe our attitude to coup group'can still have decisive effect on its decisions. We believe that’what we say to coup group co-produce delay of coup and that betrayal of coup plans to Diem is not repeat not our only way of stopping coup. We therefore need urgently your combined assessment with Harkins and CAS (including their separate comments if they desire). We concerned that our line-up of forces in I	Saigon (being cabled in next message) indicates approximately equal
balance of forces, with substantial possibility serious a::d prolonged fighting or even defeat. Either of these-could be serious or even disastrous-for U.S. interests, so that we must have assurance balance of forces clearly .favorable.	• "	*
3.	With your assessment in hand,-we mighty feel that we should convey message to Don, whether or not he gives 4 or 48 hours notice that would. (A) continue explicit hands-off policy, (3) positively encourage coup, or (g) discourage.	- •
4.	In any ease, believe Conein should find earliest opportunity express to Don that we do not find presently revealed plans give clear prospect of quick results. This conversation should call-attention important Saigon units still.apparently ldyal to Diem and raise serious issue as to what means coup group has to deal with them.
5.	From operational standpoint, we also deeply, concerned Don only spokesman for group and possibility cannot be discounted he may not be in good faith. We badly need some corroborative evidence whether Minh and others directly and completely involved. In view Doll’s claim he doesn’t handle "military planning" could not. Conein tell Don that we need better military picture and that Big Minh could 'communicate this most naturally and easily to Stillwell? "We recognize desirability involving MACV to minimum, but believe Stillwell far more.desirable this purpose than using Conein both ways.	.	'-~

6.	Complexity above actions raises question whether you should adhere to present Thursday schedule. Concur you and other U.S. elements should take no action that could indicate U.S. awareness coup possi-
ility. However, DOD is sending berth-equipped military airc ill arrive Saigon Thursday and could tsuc you out thereafter
tna
Saturday afternoon in time to meet your presently proposed arrival Washington Sunday.. You could explain this being done as convenience and that your-Washington arrival is same. .A further advantage such aircraft is that it would permit your prompt return.from any point en rouuo if necessary. To reduce time in transit, you should use this plane, but we recognize delaying your departure msy involve greater risk that you personally would appear involved, if ary action-took place. However, advantages your having extra two days in Saigon may outweigh this and we leave timing of flight to your judgment. .
7.	whether you leave Thursday or later, believe it essential that prior your departure there be fullest consultation Harkins and CAS and thou there be clear arrangements for handling (a) normal activity, (3) continued coup contacts, (C) action ’in event a coup starts. We assume you will wish Truehart as charge to be head of country team in normal situation, but highest authority desires it clearly understood than after your departure Harkins should participate in supervision- of all coup ccnuacts and that in event a coup begins, he. become head of country team and direct repr sentative of President, with. Truehart in effect acting as POLAD. On c contacts we will maintain continuous guidance and will expect equally con-tinuous reporting with prompt account of any important divergences in assessments of Harkins and Smith.	•
8.	If coup should start, question of protecting U.S. nationals at once arises. We can move Marine Battalion into Saigon by air from
o m
Okinawa within 24 hours
available. We are sending
instructions to CINCPAC to arrange orderly movement of seaborne Marine Rat-tai a on to waters adjacent to South Vietnams in position .to close Saigon within approximately 24 hours.	'	v	•	•
9.	We are now examining post-coup contingencies here'and request your immediate recahnemdations on position to be 'adopted after coup begins, especially with respect to requests for assistance' of .different sorts from one side or the other also request you forward contingency recosmendations for action if coup (A) succeeds, (3) fails, (C) is indecisive.
10.	We reiterate burden of proof must be on coup group to show a substantial possibility of quick success; otherwise, we should discourage them from proceeding since a miscalculation could result in jeopardizing U.S. position in Southeast Asia.

Your JCS 4133-63 arrived as Iwas in the proccss of drafting one for you arm-thc same lincs. I share your concern. I have not as yet seen SAIGON 768. I s; :_. to tr.c Embassy for a copy at 0S30 this morning - as of now 1100 - the Emk-.5sy has not released it. Also CINCPAC 0-300040Z infor JCS came as a surprise to me as I am unaware of any'.change in local situation which indicates necessity for ac t.-.s directed. 'Perhaps I'll find the answer in SAIGON 7oS. Or perhaps actions dl.-ectocl in CIN'CPAC 300040Z are precautionary in light of Gon. Don's statement rcport d in CAS 1925 that a coup .v/ould take place in any case not later than 2 November. I- might be noted Don also is supposed to have said CAS SAIGON 1956 - that though, the co.. . committee would not relcase the details, the .Ambassador v/ould receive the complev? plan for study two days prior to Lne scheauled times .or the coup.
I have not been inforrned by the Ambassador that he has received any such p’r-nu. I talked to him yesterday on my return from Bangkok and he offered no additional infol--raation. He has agreed to keep me completely informed-.!! anything new turns up.
Incidentally he leaves for Washington tomorrow (31 st) afternoon. If the coup is to happen before the second he's hardly going to get two days notice. -
•	One thing I have found out, Don is either.lying or playing both ends against the
middle. What he told me is diametrically opposed to what he told Col. Conein. FL
1 Conein the coup will be before November 2nd, He told me he yeas not planning a cc.n I sat with Don and Big'Minh for 2 hours during the. parade last Saturday. No one .tioned coups. To go on:	*	.	-
. Both CAS SAIGON 1896 and 1925 were sent first and‘delivered to me after dispa.e Mv 1991 was discussed with thc Ambassador prior to dispatch. My 1993 was not, basically because I had not seen-QAS SAIGON 1925 before dispatch and I just wame: . -et the record straight from my side'and where rny nance was involved.
The Ambassador and I are certainty in touch .with each other but whether the ce;: munications between us are effective is something else.- I will say Cabot's metliods c_' operations are entirely different from Amb Noltings as far as reporting in tile military is concerned.	_
’ Fritz would always clear messages concerning the military with me or my staf prior to dispatch. So would John Richardson if MACV was concerned. This is not tru today. Cite CAS 1896 and 1925 for examples. Also you'will recall I was no: the recipient of several messages you held when you were here.
CIN'CPAC brought this matter up again when I saw him in Bangkok, this past wee end. He is going to make a check, when he returns to see if he holds messages I have not received. Have just received SA1GON 76S. I will have to report you are correct in believing that the Ambassador is forwarding military reports and evaluations wi—.ov. consulting me. For his weekly report to the President, at his requcst, I furnish him a short military statement. For preparation of 768 I made no mention of the Delta. Z will answer 768 separately today.

I interpret CAP 63560 as our basic guidance and that CAS 74228 being additional thoughts did not change thc.basic guidanoc in that no initiative should now be taken to give any active covert encouragement to a coup. The Ambassador fecls that 74228 does change 63560 and that a change of government is desired and feels as stated in CAS SAIGON 1964 that the only way to bring about suoh a change is by a coup.
I'm not opposed to a change in government, no indeed, but I'm inclined to feel that at this time the change should be in methods of governing rather than Complete change of personnel. I have seen no batting order proposed by any of the coup groups. I think we should take a hard look at any proposed list before we make any decisions. In my contacts here I have seen no one with the. strength of character of Diem, at least in fighting communists. Certainly there are no Generals qualm to take over in my opinion.	4
I am not a Diem, man per se. I certainly see the faults in his character. I am here to back 14(1 million SVN people in their fight against communism and it just happens that Diem is their leader at this time. Most of the Generals I have talked to agree they can go along with Diem, all say its the Nhu family they are opposed to.
Perhaps the pressures we have begun to apply will cause Diem and Nhu to change their ways. This is apparently not"evident as yet. I'm sure thc pressures we have begun to apply if continued will affect tho'war effort. To'date they have not. I am watching this closely and will report when I think they have.	. ... *_	' •
I do not agree with the Ambassadors assessment in 763 that v/e are just holding our own. The GVN is a way ahead in the I, II and parts of the III corps -and making progress in the Delta. Nothing has happened in October to Change the assessment you and Secretary McNamara macle after your visit here.	,	.	' -<
I wouId suggest we hot try to Change horses too quickly. Tha we continue to take persuasive actions that will make the horses change tr.-cir course and methods of action. That we win the military effort as quickly as possible, then let them make any and all the changes they want.
After all, rightly or wrongly, we have backed Diem for eight -long hard years. To me it'seems incongruous now to get him. down, kid him around, and get rid of him. The US has been his mother superior and father confessor since he’s been in office and he has leaned on us heavily.
Leaders of other under-developed countries will take a dim view of our assistance if they too were led to believe thc same, fate lies in star a for them.	’ ._

1.	Admiral Felt not addee this message but will be provided cosy uoon his arrival Saloon tomorrow.
,	°	.	i
* -	2. I now hold copy of SAIGON 763 and this amplifies my MAC —.8
which initially responded to your JCS 418S-63.
3.	SAIGON 76S was Ambassador Lodge personal report to Prcsid-nt in response to DEPTEL 576 which is possible explanation why I had not seon 768 until one week after dispatch and only then when I requested a copy so I might intelligently respond to your JCS 4138-63 which referred to 763.
4.	Upon receipt of DZPTEL 576 Ambassador Lodge requested that I provide him brief suggested inputs for responses to questions 1 and 2 (a) 1 of DEPTEL 576 in that they were principally military in nature. I have done this on weekly basis but have had no knowledge as to whether my suggested brief inputs were utilized in his personal report since as indicated abot these were not opened to me.
5.	My suggested brief inputs for para 1 which were provided thc Ambassador for use as he saw fit in drafting his personal evaluations for the past three weeks follow:
‘1	6 OCT: On balance we are gaining in the contest with the VC. T'nere will continue to be minor ups and downs but the general trend has been and continues upward.
23	OCT: While significant changes are, and will be, difficult to identify on a day to day or even weekly comparative basis as regards the contest with the Viet Cong, the general trend continues to be favorable. The tempo of RVN - initiated operations is increasing and recently the tempo of VC - initiated activity has fallen off.
30	OCT: No Change from that previously reported. National day -f-t.irs this past week tended to bring about a slight reduction in the tempo p£ RVX initiated actions, however VC initiated actions also waned and on b lance the trend continues to be favorable.
6. My suggested brief inputs for paragraph. 2(a) which were provided the Ambassador for use as he saw fit in drafting his personal evaluations for the past three weeks follow:	•
16 OCT: The government has responded at many points when we have Cited need for improvement in the campaign against the VC (shift of boundaries; placement of VNSF activities in corps areas under OPCON : corps comdr; reallocation of forces). Additionally .C-en Don and C-en Stilwell, my G-3 have spent the last week in the conduct of a Corps by Corps assessment of the present situation v/ith a view to'Turthcr desirabl.. reallocation of forces. Based on their reccmrr.or.dations I will make further recommendations to Pres. Diem- (wr inclusion in ANS to para 2(a) Ambassador was advised that US/GVN military relations remain good).

\
23 OCT: Response received from the government in-reaction to military areas where we have cited needed improvement has been favor able in some areas, while in other areas no indication_of response has been received to date. In no case have they flatly resisted recommended improvements. Favorable indications are the commitment of nearly half of the general reserve to operations, plans for possible further redistribution of forces, and a recognition of the requirement to effect consolidation in the strategic hamlet program.	.	,
30 OCT: No specific responses have been received from the govern-ment this past week in reaction to military areas where we have cited necd for improvement. This is believed cue in great part to their pre-occupation’v/ith National day affairs.
7. Comparison of my 23 October suggested brief inputs quotec above with SAIGON 768 indicates Ambassador Lodge did not see fit to utilise my suggestions to any significant degree. It also apparent that upon further reflection Ambassador determined that more detailed response was required than he initially felt necessary when he requested brief inputs on prinCipally military items.	:	•	'_	—
8. I believe certain portions SAIGON 7 68 require specific comment. These follow:	.. .	— -----
Para F of answer to question 1 - View of Vice Pres Tho that there are only 15 to 20 all-around hamlets in the area south of Saigon which are really good is ridiCulous and indicates necd for him to gee out of Saigon and visit countryside so as to really know of progress which ir bcing made.- In past two weeks I have visited nine Delta provinces, (Tay Ninh, Dinh Duong, Hau.Nghia, Long An, Kier. Phong, Kien Hoa, An C-'__.ng,. Phong Dinh, Chuong Thien) eighf ox-wllich are south of Saigon, and I do not find the province Chiefs or seCtor advisors jo hold tine same views as Vice Pres Tho.	.
Para. H of answer to question 1 - I am unable to concur in statement that quote one cannot drive as much around the country as one could two years ago end of quote. I believe it will be some time before, if we ever do, experience mass surrenders of the VC.' I am unable to concur in statement that VC is quote in fact, reckoned at a higher figure than ie was two years ago end quote. I have not observed the signs that hatred of tne government has tended to diminish the Army's vigor, enthusiasm and enterprise. I find it difficult to believe the few rumors one hears regarding Generals being paid off with money and flashy cars. Most cars I see ir. use by Generals are same they have beer, using for past two years and hw if any qualify as flashy to my mind. I do not concur with the evaluation, of the 14 October report of the Dclta Subcommittee of thc Committee m ProvinCe Rehabilitation which states that the VC are gaining. Moreover “

take exception to the implication that the report represents official country team agcnCy views and is consequently authoritative in the views it presents. Agency representatives on this sub-committee served as individuals in reporting to the COOROR Committee, incidentally there were wide divergcncics even among sub-committee members. COPROR Committee received but did not place its stamp of approval or conourrence on rcport of its Sub-Committee. COPROR "Committee returned the report to its Sub-Committee for rework. Consequently this report has not as yet been submitted to country team nor has it been referred to individual country team, agencies for review . and/or comment. Any views quoted from this Sub-Committee report thcrcforc have no rpt no validity as expressions of country team or individual agency views.	.	.	.
Para J of answer to question 1 - With regard'to the quote existing political control over troop movements, which prevents optimum use of . the Army end quote. I do not deny that political influences enter into this picture however I feel we have made and ate making significant strides in this area and do not Concur that time is not working for us - so long as political controls remain as at present.

.1. We must, of course, get best possible estimate of chance of co—’s success and this estimate m.Uqt color our thinking, but do not think we have the power to delay or discourage a coup. Don has made it clear many times that this is a Vietnamese affair. It is theoretically possible for us to turn over the information which has been given to us in confidence to Diem and this would undoubtedly stop the coup and would make traitors out of us. For practical purposes therefore I would say that we have very little influence on what is essp-taany a Vietnamese affair. In addition, this would place the
I	heads of the Generals, their civilian supporters, and. lower military
officers on the spot, thereby sacrificing .a significant portion of the civilian and military leadership needed to carry the war against the VC to its successful conclusion After our efforts not to discourage a coup and this change of heart, we would, foreclose any possibility of change of the C-V.I for the better. Diem/Nhu have displayed no intentions to date of a desire to change the traditional methods of control through police action or take any repeat any actions which would unde:ri-le the power position or solidarity of the Ngo family. This, despite our heavy -pressures directed DEPIEL 534. If our attempt to thwart this c"g were successful, which we doubt, it is our firm estimate that ycur.ger officers, small groups of military, would then- engage in'an abortive -.ction creating chaos ideally suited to VC objectives.
2.	while we will attempt a combined assessment in.a following message.-time has not yet pemitued suosuantive examination of this natter with General Harkins. My general view is that the U.S. is trying to bring this radi eval country into the 20th Century and that we have made considerable progress in military and economic ways but to gain victory we must also bring them into the 20th Century politically and that can only be done by • either a thoroughgoing change in the behavior of the present government ■ or by another government. The Viet Cong-problem is partly military out it is also partly psychological and political.
3.	.With respect to paragraph 3 Ref., I believe’that we should continue our present position of keeping hands of— out continue to monitor and press for more detailed information. CAS has been analyzing pc .ntial coup forces for some time and it is their estimate that the Generals have • probably figured their chances pretty closely and probably also expect that once they begin to move, not only planned units, but other units will join them. We believe that Vietnam's best Generals are involved in

4.	Re para. 4, Ref., we expect that-Conein will meet Don on the night of 30 Oct or early morning 31 Oct. We agree with Para. 4, Ref., that we should continue to press for details and question Don as to his estimate of the relative strengths of opposing forces. We do not believe, however, that we should show any signs of attempting to direct this affair ourselves or of giving the impression of second thoughts on this Vietnamese initiation. In the meantime, we will respond speci-fically to CAS Washington 79126. Please note that CAS Saigon 2059 corrects CAS Saigon 2023 and two regiments of the 7th Division are in-cluded. in the coup forces.
5-	Apparently Para. 5, Ref., overlooks CAS 1445, 5 Oct 196.3 which gave an account of the face to face meeting of General "Big Mir.h" and Conein at Minh's instigation and through the specific arrangement of Gen Don. Minh specifically identified Gen Don as participating in a plan to change the government. Please note that Minh’s remark- parallel in every way the later statements of Gen. Don. We believe tlnat the limita-tion of contact to Don and Cein is an appropriate security measure consonant with our urging that the smallest number of persons be aware: of these details.
6.	We do not believe it wise to ask that "Big Minh" pass his plans to Gen. Stilwell. The Vietnamese believe that there are members of the U.S. military who leak to the Government of Vietnam. I do not doubt than this 'is an unjust suspicion but it is a fact that this suspicion exists and there is no use in pretending that it does not.
7.	I much appreciate your furnishing the berth-equipped military aircraft which I trust is a jet. I intend to tell Pan American that a jet has been diverted for my use and therefore I will no longer need, their services. This will undoubtedly leak to the newspapers -nd the GVN may study this move with some- suspicion. I will answer any inquiries on this score to the effect that I -am most pleased by this attention and that this is obviously done as a-measure to insure my cct-fort and save my time. To allay suspicions further, I will offer space on the aircraft to MACV for emergency leave cases, etc.', and handle this in as routine fashion as possible. I wish to reserve comment as to my actual time of departure until I have some additional information, hopefully tomorrow.

11.	As to requests from the Generals, they may well have need ' . of funds at the last moment with which to buy off potential opposition.
' To the extent that these funds can be passed discreetly, I believe we should furnish them, provided we are convinced that thc proposed coup is sufficiently well organized to have a good chance of success. If they arc successful, they will undoubtedly ask for prompt recognition and some assurance that military and economic aid will continue at nomual level. We should be prepared to make these statements if the issue is clear-cut predicating our position on the President’s stated desire to continue the war against the VC to final victory. VOA might be an important means of disseminating this message. Should the coup fail, we vil 1 have to pick up the nieces as besu we car. at that time. We slave
. a commitment to the Generals from the August- episode to attempt to help ■in the evacuation of their dependents. We should try to live up to this if conditions will permit. American complicity will undoubtedly be charged and there might bc some acts taken against specific personal---es which we should anticipate and. make proves-on against as ossu we can. Should the coup prove indecisive and a protracted struggle is in progra.m, • we should probably offer our good offices to help resolve the issue in the interest of the war against the VC. This might hold some benefit in
. terms of concessions by GVN. Ue will naturally incur some opprobrium
. from both sides in our role as mediator.• However, this opprobrium would probably be less distasteful than a deadlock which would open the door, to the VC. We consider such a deadlock as the least likely possibility of the three.
12.	As regards your para. 10, I do not know what more proof can be offered than the fact these men are obviously prepared to risk their lives and that they want nothing for themselves. If I am. any judge cf
• human nature, Don’s face expressed of sincerity and determination on ths morning that I spoke to him. Heartily agree that a miscalculation could, jeo pardize position in Southeast Asia. We also run. tremendous riks by doing nothing.

CAS 79407, 30 Oct '63
FROM BUNDY TO LODGE
1.	Our reading your thoughtful 2063 leads us to believe a significant difference of shading may exist on one crucial point (see next para.) and on one or two lesser matters easily clarified.
2.	we do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power to delay or discourage a coup. In your paragraph 12 you say that if you were convinced that the coup was going to fail you would of course do everything you could to stop it. we believe that on this same basis you should take action to persuade coup leaders to stop or delay any operation which, in your best judgment, does not clearly give high prospect of success, we have not considered any betrayal of generals to Diem, and our 79109 explicitly reject that course. We recognize the danger of appearing hostile to generals, but we believe that our own position should be on as firm ground as possible, hence we cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention. We believe that your standard for intervention should be that stated above.
3-	Therefore, if you should conclude that there is not clearly a high propsect of success, you should communicate this doubt to generals in a way calculated to persuade them to desist at least until chances are better. In such a communication you should use the weight of U.S. best advice and explicity reject any implication that we oppose the effort of the generals because of preference for present regime, we recognize need to bear in mind general's interpretation of U.S. role in 1960 coup attempt, and your agent should maintain clear distinction between strong and honest advice given as a friend and any opposition to their obj ectives.
4.	We continue to be deeply interested in up-to-the-minute assesment of prospects and are sending this before reply to our CAS 79126. We want con-tinuous exchange latest assessments on this topic.
5-	To clarify our intent, paragraph 7 of our 79109 is rescinded and we restate our desires as follows:
a.	while you are in Saigon you will be Chief of Country Team in all circumstances and our only instruction is that we are sure it will help to have Harkins fully informed at all stages and to use advice from both him and Smith in framing guidance for coup contacts and assessment. We contin a to be concerned that neither Conein nor any other reporting source is getting the clarity we would like with respect to alienment of forces and level of determi-nation among generals.
b.	when you leave Saigon and before there is a coup, Trueha e will be Chief of the Country Team. Our only modification of existing procedures is that in this circumstance we wish all instruction to Conein to be conducted in,immediate consultation with Harkins and Smith so that all three know what is sold in Conein. Any disagreement among the three on such instruction should be reported to washington and held for our resolution,• when time permits.
c.	If you have left and a coup occurs, we believe that emergency situation requires, pending your return, that direction of country team be vested in most senior officer with experience of military decisions, and the officer in our view is Harkins. We do'not intend that this switch in final responsibility should be publicized in any way, and Harkins will of course be guided in basic posture by our instructions, which follow in paragraph 6.

we do not believe that this switch will have the effect suggested in your paragraph 8.
6.	This paragraph contains our present standing instructions for U.S. posture in the event of a coup.
a.	U.S. authorities will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side, and U.S.-controlled aircraft and other resources will not be committed between the battle lines or in support of either side, without authorization from Washington.
b.	In event of indecisive contest, U.S. authorities may in their discretion agree to perform any acts agreeable to both sides, such as removal of key personalties or relay of information. In such actions, however, U.S. authorities will strenuously avoid appearance of pressure on either side. It is not in the interest of USG to be or appear to be either instrument of exist-ing government or instrument of coup.
c.	In the event of imminent or actual failure of coup, U.S. authori-ties may afford asylum in their discretion to those to whom there is any express or implied obligation of this sort. We believe however that in such a case it would be in our interest and probably in interest of those seeking asylum that they seek protection of other Embassies in addition to our own. This point should be made strongly if need arises.
d.	But once a coup under responsible leadership has begun, and within these restrictions, it is in the interest of the U.S. Government that it should succeed.
7.	we have your message about return to washington and we suggest that all public comment be kept as low-key and quiet as possible, and we also urge that if possible you keep open the exact time of your departure. We are strongly sensitive to great disadvantage of having you out of Saigon if this should turn out to be a week of decision, and if it can be avoided we would prefer not to see you pinned to a fixed hour of departure now.
