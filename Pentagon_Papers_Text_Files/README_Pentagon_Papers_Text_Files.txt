README for 'Pentagon_Papers_Text_Files': 

Methodology: These are the uncleaned txt files that were exported from the ABBYFineReader software which was used for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
These are provided for researchers who want to have control over exactly how the txt files are cleaned. Individuals who want to use already cleaned text files of the Pentagon Papers can consult the file "Cleaned_Pentagon_Papers_text_files". 

Files: There are 48 files in total, which is one less from the original 49 Pentagon Papers. The file Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-C-10 was statistical reports that do not make much sense when OCR'd, so this was removed.
